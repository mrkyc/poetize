So you think the areas gray, but it continues each day
A bad example of the attitude you portray
Act like I owe you my life
You should be burdened with strife
Can't find a single reason I could live with you as my wife
So I continue to pray, and hope that you'll go away
A bad addiction to a home wrecking thing who plays

With my heart and that's the bottom line
I feel so empty now

What can you give me I can't give myself?
That's right. and what part of my life can you fix, that I can't fix my damn self?

Oh God, oh God, I'm losing patience each day
I've put myself in harms way
Can't seem to justify none of the shit you say
Can't find another way out, there's nothing left but pure doubt
I'm on the verge of pulling all my hair straight out
So if you listen to me, not to the powers that be
We're not supposed to be together, can't you see?
You might also like
Indecision is the bottom line, I feel so empty now

Just what can you give me I can't give myself?
That's right, and what part of my life can you fix, that I can't fix my damn self?
Just what can you give me I can't give myself?
That's right, and what part of my life can you fix, that I can't fix my damn self?
My damn self

I'm gonna show you now, this time I'm getting out
I've said it many times, but this time I have figured out
Just how I'm moving on, it's taken way too long
Inside I know I'll feel much better, when you're really gone

What can you give me I can't give myself?
That's right, and what part of my life can you fix, that I can't fix all by myself?
Just what can you give me I can't give myself?
