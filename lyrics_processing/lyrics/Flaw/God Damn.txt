Goddamn
Goddamn, maybe I don't have a plan
I'm sucking up to the moneyman
Something that I will never do now
So I look, I hit him for all he took
Cause everything I've learned in books
Has all but lied to me

Goddamn, no I can't understand
That I step into a land of my old man but
Goddamn, I won't pass away now
So I relive all the pain everyday
So you can't ever say that
From you, I can't build the way, yeah

And at the time, you people are judging me
Cause you can't be what you see
It's not anybody's fault now
Let you come fall into a religious day
Something that I really hate
Instilled, I'm by your family

Well goddamn I cannot understand
Living to your dreams left by your clan but
Like that, I won't pass away now
So I relive all the pain everyday
I don't want to hear lies prophetic
From you, I can't build the way now
I get up, I get up, I get up for now
So get up, so get up, so get up for now
I get up, I get up, I get up for now
Take my life, can't take my pride
I get up, I get up, I get up for now
So get up, so get up, so get up for now
I get up, I get up, I get up for now
Take my life, can't take my pride

Ohhhh
Ohhhh
So I want you to take the field with me
It's the way its got to be
We all deserve an equal match now
You overcome and form your own beliefs
Instead of listening to the pleas of innocence and apathy

Goddamn, I cannot understand
Living to your dreams left by your clan but
Like that, I won't pass away now
So I relive all the pain everyday
I don't want to hear lies prophetic
From you, I have broke away now
I get up, I get up, I get up for now
So get up, so get up, so get up for now
I get up, I get up, I get up for now
Take my life, can't take my pride
I get up, I get up, I get up for now
So get up, so get up, so get up for now
I get up, I get up, I get up for now
Take my life, can't have my pride

Can't have my pride
Can't have my pride
Oh no, oh no, can't have my pride
Can't have my pride
