But I don't wanna feel this way
Cause I can see right through you
And all the mindless things you say
I think I'd like to kill you
If I thought I'd get away
I'm really trying to get though
And find a way to cope with it
How is it I didn't see
You'd probably be the death of me
I'd never thought that I would be somebody's victim
Begging for my life again, praying for it all to end
I'd never thought that I would be somebody's victim
Think about all the things we've been through
The sleepless nights and broken days
I can't believe you would hide the real you
Had to fight you just to get away
And now I'm grateful
And my body is black and blue
And all my thoughts, they always seem to lead to you
How is it I didn't see
You'd probably be the death of me
I'd never thought that I would be somebody's victim
Begging for my life again, praying for it all it all to end
I'd never thought that I would be somebody's victim
You might also likeNow I'll never be the same
And I know you're the one to blame
Can you see what I've become
I've let you make me your victim
I've let you make me your victim
I've let you make me your victim
I've let you make me your victim!
How is it I didn't see
You'd probably be the death of me
I'd never thought that I would be somebody's victim
Begging for my life to end, praying for it all to end
I'd never thought that I would be somebody's victim
I know that to say away form you
I don't have anymore to give
Can't you see what I've become
