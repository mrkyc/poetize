See the same old faces but inside you know they lie
See familiar places but they try, and they try, and they try
Separate the races with no reason as to why
No more... no prejudice
Right!
We're calling out all those minds
Flagrantly 'cause we will never pacify
There's always something inside us
Separated by our own eyes
There's no way our consciences
Will let your indecency just wander by
We're no longer restrained
By your head games!

Don't we bleed the same color red?
Don't we feel the same pain engraved?
Don't we bleed the same color red?
Don't we feel the same pain?

Take a look inside your mind and see what you can find
A look inside your mind and see what you will find, yeah
Take a look inside your mind and see what you can find
Can't you see? We all bleed red!
You act just like if
As though we've been given something
Yeah, to make it all seem right
A way to brush it aside
Change the facts all around now
There's only one fight
Strong enough to make those bastards just run and hide
It's called equality pride
Makes us real men!
