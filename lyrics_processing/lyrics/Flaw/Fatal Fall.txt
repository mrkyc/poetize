There's far too many people waiting for the end to come
This just is not the case
Divided by the same beliefs that seem to end as one
It's such a bitter taste

I'm trying to save you from a fatal fall
'Cause I don't think that you can take it
You gotta stop before you lose it all
And find the strength so you can make it

I know it feels as though inside you are the only one
Who's ever felt disgraced
Deep down the hurt inside is crying out
It's just begun at such a rapid pace
You've started acting like the world has slowly come undone
It's such a lonely place
I know it feels as though inside you are the only one
That is just is not the case

I'm trying to save you from a fatal fall
'Cause I don't think that you can take it
You gotta stop before you lose it all
And find the strength so you can make it
I'm trying to save you from a fatal fall
'Cause I don't think that you can take it
You gotta stop before you lose it all
And find the strength so you can make it

How can I just sit by with all the things I've seen?
I've gotta save your life with every ounce of me
This is our final try to raise your self-esteem
A new start and a new day so wash it clean

I'm trying to save you from a fatal fall
'Cause I don't think that you can take it
You gotta stop before you lose it all
And find the strength so you can make it
I'm trying to save you from a fatal fall
'Cause I don't think that you can take it
You gotta stop before you lose it all
