We started following a certain description
We started simple and fair once again
Before there wasn't any need for an answer
Things were much different then but
Now you question who I am
Who I am inside
Now there's nothing left to hide
So here it goes
This is my letter
Hope you're alright. It's been rough for me
Thinking all night about the places I'd be
If I maybe just did a little bit more
You might've let me become a man for sure
And if I might express one concern
It seems an issue. All day at every turn
What's the next step, the latest hole in my life
What's next for me to learn
What's next for me to learn
Engulf myself into a permanent mystery
No one day just as the next not for me
It's so confusing when I look at my history
I just can't handle that yet, no

One more friendship ends
And then for awhile
I can breathe again
Hope you're alright. It's been rough for me
Thinking all night about the places I'd be
