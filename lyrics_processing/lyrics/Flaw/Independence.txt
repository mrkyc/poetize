That's not fucking graffiti, that's a sign
I'll read it for you, it says this is fucking private property
No fucking trespassing, this means fucking you
All my days are numbered any way

You think you know what I pictured
But you motherfucking don't
You think you know
So long as I have a head
But you can't and you won't
So at the corner of same decisions and lines
It takes a life time
Don't you see that I don't want you all inside my mind now
What if I take it all fucking back
Would you like a mixed up track
Bet you would like
A little something that is real
So I got to stand up straight
Cause I got more patience then hate
And it's still over

But I just won't care anymore
If you can't see things my way
I won't see yours myself
What about me, God?
In my life, I still won't care anymore
If you're not there for me
I won't be there my self
I know, I know I am right
You might also like
All my days now
Sinking and drinking
It's over, my whole world
I'm thinking you can't see inside me
I'm free and I will be that way
Till the day I check myself off to bleed
And then see it will never come again
And you will see that
What if I take it all fucking back
Would you like a mixed up track
You know I would like a little something that is real
So I got to play it safe
I got more taste then waste
And it's still over

But I just won't care anymore
If you can't see things my way
I won't see yours myself
What about me, God?
In my life, I still won't care anymore
If you're not there for me
I will not be there my self

Because I'm trapped out
Trapped, dead, such scum
Maybe things will work themselves out in their own due time
Trapped out, dead, bloated, such scum
Shouldn't have to compromise with my own god damn mind
Trapped out, dead, bloated scum
All these things are gonna change in this time
Unless I will not try to be one
You think you fucked this shit up
You didn't, you little whore
You think you fucked this shit up
You didn't, you little whore
You think you fucked this shit up
You didn't, you little whore
You think, you fucked this shit
Why lie
