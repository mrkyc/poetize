I've been running away for far too long
Afraid of what?
Afraid of what I know is soon to come
I may not be much of an example right now
But I can give you all of my knowledge on how to get along in this place
Right now, all I can say....is I will do the best that I can
To be a good example of man
And I know one day that you'll understand
You deserve the best that I am
You deserve the best that I am
It's so hard
So hard to think about when I was a child
So angry at life
I blamed the world for such a long, long time
But things happened so quickly
Some people just go
I needed answers to heal me
I wanted to know how to get by
And now its my turn to say
That I will do the best that I can
To be a good example of man
And I know one day that you'll understand
You deserve the best that I am
So I gotta do the best that I can
To be a good example of man
And I know one day that you'll understand
You deserve the best that I am, I am, I am

That's why I gotta do the best that I can
To be a good example of man
And I know one day that you'll understand
You deserve the best I am, I am, I am
And I will..
Cause I will..
