Me and Jimmie Rodgers used to ride them
Rollin' boxcars in the summer time
Jimmie, he'd play his guitar, I'd lay back
And watch the stars and sip my wine

Me and Audie Murphy used to crawl out on
Our bellies through the German lines
Audie, I won't leave you here, I'll pull you through
'Cause you know you're a friend of mine

Me and Phil Rizzuto, didn't we move like lightnin'
'Round there on the double play?
I'd look over in the stands and Marilyn would see me
And she'd smile and wave
Hell, no, Coach Lombadi, this old broken back
Ain't nothin' if the game is saved
And fellers, if I don't pull through just put
A little golden football on my grave
John Wayne, he once said to me them Japs, they'll take that island
And we've got to save the old red, white and blue
Someone's got to swim out to that submarine and warn 'em
You know it hate like hell to ask you to
Me and Sugar Ray, we used to spar together
Up there, an old Stillman's Gym
Knowin' someday it would be the garden
And the championship for me or him
And coop if no one in this town is man enough
To back you when Frank Miller comes
Come 'High Noon', I'll walk with you, I've had a few
But I know how to use a gun
Betty Grable, don't you cry, you know you can be a star
And with my drinkin', I'd just hold you back
So, go on, sign the contracts, kid
I'll read about you in some old newspaper from some rack
You might also like
'Cause me and Jimmie Rodgers, we still ride them
Rollin' boxcars in the summer time
Jimmie, he plays his guitar, I lay back
And watch the stars and sip my wine


So what's old Hank, I said, "Hank, I wrote a real good song"
And he said lemme hear it
I went out of a truck to give my guitar
