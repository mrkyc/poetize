(His name is Kino Beats)

Strawberries and whipped cream
Drip like, simply
Said he wanna fuck me 'til I'm pissy
Can't believe this shit like Ripley
I can't run away, he gon' whip me
Dick too good, can't keep my distance
Free as a bird
But he fucked me like he been in prison for years, yeah (Whoa)
We fuck on the table, no frontin' the bill
He said "I know you, ooh-ooh, can get nasty"
So flex up like you do gymnastics
Face in the pillow, tryna look back at it, ayy

Turned into a bad habit, yeah, turned into a bad habit
Tell me that it's mine when I grab it
Tryna take as much as I can, gotta take an intermission
Said, "Nah, I can't risk it," said, "Nah, I can't risk it"
Used to have a fence with the picket, I opened up my gift
He got an obsession, can't put down that fit
Got the perfect rhyme, got the perfect tits
We do sixty-nine, I like that you don't tell shit
He creep me from behind, sit on his nose, it smell like roses
Yeah, slowly strokin'
I'm his favorite drug, I can't overdose him
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm his favorite girl, I can't overdose him (I can't do that)
Yeah-yeah, yeah (Can't give you too much)
I can overdose him

Tell her, "Look back at it"
I know when she talk to me and moans, like, "Daddy"
And you know I am not braggin', but the world know I'm havin'
You do a split right on it, then I buy your ass a Patek
I ain't even know it, that I'm closure, had a fatty
And I swear she got that water, almost drowned, but I ain't panic
And I'm from the north side, got a couple killers on the west side
And she tell me that she love me
But I think she love all the neck, ice
Okay, in my mind I'm like, "Yeah, aight"
I don't say nothin', 'cause the neck right
Yes, she ride all on my dick, like a new whip, this a test-ride
And I might buy your girl a 'Rari so I can speed up her sex drive
I remember when she used to text high
Now she text me, "You the right size"
