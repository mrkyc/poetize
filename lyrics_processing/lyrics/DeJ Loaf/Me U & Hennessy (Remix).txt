Can we stay home tonight?
Try something new tonight?
This drink got me feelin' right
I'm 'bout to lose my mind
You, me, and Hennessy, look what you did to me
Fuckin' so crazy, you twirlin' and spinnin' me
My head keep on spinnin', my legs keep on shakin'
But my head keep on spinnin'
I'm out of my mind, let's keep on sippin'
Let's make some babies and make it official
I feel you inside, no better feelin'
I throw it back, and you catch my driftin'
You shiftin' inside you got me screamin'
You got me yellin' out yo name, ooh, I need you
You kiss on my thighs and then you eat it
Pause for a minute, then I let you beat it
I lovin' this ride, smooth like a Bimmer
Smooth like that Henny, this what happens when we drinkin'
I'm not gonna lie, you got me speechless
Got 69, more than 25 reasons

Me, Hennessy, and you
Me, Hennessy, and you
Me, Hennessy, and you
Me, Hennessy, and you

You, me, and Hennessy, look what you did to me (And you)
I say my head keep on spinnin' (Couple candles)
Me, Hennessy, and you (No TV's reporting bad news, it's just me, Hennessy, and you)
Some fast food
'Bout to act a damn fool in your brand new
Your brand new
Foola

Can we stay home tonight?
Try something new tonight?
Don't wear your thong tonight
No Trojan on tonight
Oh Lord, I usually don't do this
But I'ma go and get the quarter goin'
Ignore the phone and the car alarm
Hold up, I'm 'bout to cum, no, false alarm
Ooh, makeup off, no weave, lashes off, yeah
Codeine, Adderall, it's a pussy marathon
Girl, you don't love me, you just love my doggystyle
Put this dick up in your mouth while you're talkin'
Like, "What you talkin' 'bout?"
Yeah, 'cause you've been talkin', no more talkin'
While I make us a drink, and I don't drink
So when you're not lookin' I pour some out in the sink
Babe, I guess chemistry is true
But I don't know if it's the Hennessy or you
I heard you eat pussy too and I'm feelin' that
I hope your girlfriend feelin' me too
I'ma fuck her real good right next to you
Then look at you like it's finna be you
Me, Hennessy, and you
And you
Couple candles
No TV's reporting bad news, it's just me, Hennessy, and you
Some fast food
And you gon' act a damn fool on this good wood
This bamboo
Mula!

You, me and Hennessy, look what you did to me
I say my head keep on spinnin'
Me, Hennessy and you, ayy
Ayy, this what happens when we drinkin'
