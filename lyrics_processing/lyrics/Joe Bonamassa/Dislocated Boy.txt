Lost in the seven seas
Sail on, don't you come back
Until you learn the birds and the bees
Who will you find waiting for you
Squeeze blood in the wine
Left to call my preacher
And my very lovely wife
I said, hey now, knocked down, why'd you do it
Roll me like a hurricane
All is a bust and I'm numb, like novocaine
Who done it, what's up, you said
Sell me out why don't you boy
I'm alone, severely broken
I'm a dislocated boy
I have thought to rise my dictions
And I've suffocated my pride
Before you and I embarked on
One hell of a ride
Boy, I've had these blues
Since I been six years old
But tell me don't you worry
About my very heavy load

Knuckles on the floor. and there's shattered glass
And one hell of a scar
Broke down and hungry, you said so
Sell me out, why don't you boy
I'm alone, severely broken
I'm a dislocated boy
All I need is my old guitar
And I'll play you the best damn blues
Heavy affections, and I hate to lose
Thirty-five years ago
I was born on Robert Johnson's
It's all been for you baby
I'm gonna make it back someday
I said, hey now, knocked down, why'd you do it
Roll me like a hurricane
All is a bust and I'm numb, like novocaine
Who done it, what's up, you said
Sell me out why don't you boy
I'm alone, severely broken
I'm a dislocated boy
So tell me about your working class hero, baby
Tell me 'bout your
Mine was born in Mississippi, 'round 1923
Blue collar flannel shirts
Was my Father's way
Worked in a factory
'Til his dying day
And I said, knock down, drag out, bar fight
Knuckles on the floor. and there's shattered glass
And one hell of a scar
Broke down and hungry, you said so
Sell me out, why don't you boy
I'm alone, severely broken
