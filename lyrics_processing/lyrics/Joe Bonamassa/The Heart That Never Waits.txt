Well, I rolled the dice, baby
Now I'm left out all alone
I was lost in a shuffle, babe
Lost and halfway gone
Oh, I know you and that vengeful woman inside
Wore out my welcome, I knew when to step aside

Time is the healer that rescued me
The blues led to the bottle that landed me on the street
When it's rainin' down with worry and you know it's too late
It's the train that never comes and the heart that never waits

I'll be moving on (Moving on, I'll be moving on)
I'll be moving on (Moving on, I'll be moving on)
I'll be moving on (Moving on, I'll be moving on)
I'll be moving on (Moving on, I'll be moving on)

Used to be perfect, babe
I saw love in your eyes
Put my wild days behind me
I thought I had her right
The gods must have heard, I guess I spoke too soon
They had all the plans, just not for me and you

Look over there, thinking you are all that
Wrapped around my finger, find out it's all an act
I see through you, woman, and that sweet masquerade
What do you want from me? All you do is throw me shade

Time is the healer that rescued me
The blues led to the bottle that landed me on the street
When it's rainin' down with worry and you know it's too late
It's the train that never comes and the heart that never waits
