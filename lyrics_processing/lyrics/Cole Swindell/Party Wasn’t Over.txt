There she was, little blue jean buzz
Just bare footing around
I said, "What's up?" She hopped in the truck
And we were right away running the town

She's the kinda girl that walks in to your lonely world
And everything dark just lights up
But all summers end, now she's gone with the wind
And the reason I spend so many nights up

Somebody, somebody shoulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
Hands up in the air, still swaying
That band she loves still playing
She had this old boy from the boondocks
Sweet talking, walking on moon rocks
I wish somebody woulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
This party, this party wa-wa-wasn't over

I still hear her laughing like it just happened
Like I was just with her here
Well, she had the magic and I had the habit
But then she just disappeared

See, I'm the kinda guy that just can't get her off my mind
No matter how hard I try, she's all I think of
Another lesson learned, but hey, the world still turns
So I guess it's time to turn another drink up

Somebody, somebody shoulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
Hands up in the air, still swaying
That band she loves still playing
She had this old boy from the boondocks
Sweet talking, walking on moon rocks
I wish somebody woulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over

These days, I can't even hear a wave crash
And I get carried away and go George Strait back
To a slow dance out in the sand
When the keg was still cold and she was holding my hand

Somebody, somebody shoulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
Hands up in the air, still swaying
That band she loves still playing
She had this old boy from the boondocks
Sweet talking, walking on moon rocks
I wish somebody woulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
No, it wasn't over
Yeah, this party, this party, this party wasn't over
Hands still swaying, band still playing
Damn, this party wasn't over
This party, this party, this party wasn't over
