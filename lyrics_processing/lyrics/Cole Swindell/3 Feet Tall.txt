We took a ride up a golden elevator
They both cried as they signed a stack of papers
Mom got the car, Dad got the truck
I got a Happy Meal and a baseball
I didn't get it 'til we got home
And all his stuff was in a U-Haul

He pushed me for a while in the swing
Kissed my head and said, "See you next week"

There's a lot I don't remember, but that cryin' down the hall
Had a way of makin' me wonder maybe it was all my fault
I got stuck in the middle of weekends and holidays
And my suitcase was too little to carry all that weight
I might not have understood it all
But not everything goes over your head
Even when you're three feet tall

And she kept the house, he found a two-bedroom apartment
I found out you can't roll Hot Wheels 'cross the carpet
They were sad, but we got through
Dropped me off with "I love you's"
It was "ask your dad" and "mind your mother"
I just wish that they coulda loved each other

I was too young to get what they meant when they said "fine"
But now I'm old enough to know how hard it is to fake a smile

There's a lot I don't remember, but that cryin' down the hall
Had a way of makin' me wonder maybe it was all my fault
And I got stuck in the middle of weekends and holidays

I might not have understood it all
But not everythin' goes over your head
Even when you're three feet tall
