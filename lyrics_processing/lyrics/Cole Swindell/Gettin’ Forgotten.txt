The dam broke in her blue eyes
When that goodbye
Slipped off of my tongue
I said, "Girl, you gonna be fine"
"In no time, you'll be moving on"
I didn't think it'd be this fast
But looking through the plate glass
Of this bar

She's up on stage, singing with a frat band
Shoes in her left, beer in her right hand
Got me shakin' my head, good god man
I must have been blind
She got her friends and her free bird face on
Boys buzzin, got 'em getting their chase on
No signs of her putting them brakes on
And no doubt in my mind
That she's just getting rockin'
And I'm gettin' forgotten tonight

Yeah, I was wanting these new wings
So I could do things
Anything that I want
Thought I was gonna fly high
Turns out I couldn't be more wrong
I think I got a broken pair
'Cause I should be up there where she is

Yeah, way up on stage, singing with a frat band
Shoes in her left, beer in her right hand
Got me shakin' my head, good god man
I must have been blind
She got her friends and her free bird face on
The boys buzzin, got 'em getting their chase on
No signs of her putting them brakes on
And no doubt in my mind
That she's just getting rockin'
And I'm gettin' forgotten tonight

This ain't what I had in mind
This heart full of regret
Forever left behind
With this picture in my head

Of her up on stage, singing with a frat band
Shoes in her left, beer in her right hand
Got me wishing that I was that mic stand
Man, I was so blind
She got her friends and her free bird face on
The boys buzzin, got 'em getting their chase on
And no signs of her putting them brakes on
And no doubt in my mind
That she's just getting rockin'
And I'm gettin' forgotten tonight
That's right
And she's up there rocking
