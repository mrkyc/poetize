Girl I swear
I get scared looking in your eyes
Start thinking about where I'd be now
If I wasn't with you tonight
I've done a lot of crazy things
But you saved me and you reeled me in
There ain't no doubt
I'd take us right now
Over me back when

A lot of beer got drank
A lot of hell got raised
A lot of nights got long
But that was long
Before I saw your face
Now baby I'm holding on
To what I never wanna lose
I took a few wrong turns
Down a couple back roads
But wound up where
I was supposed to

Making my way
Making my way to you
Yeah, Making my way
Making my way to you

Now I know why all those
Wrong ones didn't work out
It's easy to see
But hard to believe
That I got my arms around
My forever, I coulda never
Dreamed it up this good
Ain't it funny how
Things work out
Better than you
Thought they would

Back when a lot of beer got drank
A lot of hell got raised
A lot of nights got long
But that was long
Before I saw your face
Now baby I'm holding on
To what I never wanna lose
I took a few wrong turns
Down a couple back roads
But wound up where
I was supposed to
Making my way to you
I didn't know what
I was looking for
No, I didn't have a clue
Next thing I know
I'm thanking the lord
For everything I went through

Making my way
Making my way to you
While I was
Makng my way
Making my way to you, yeah

A lot of beer got drank
A lot of hell got raised
A lot of nights got long
But that was long
Before I saw your face
Now baby I'm holding on
To what I never wanna lose
I took a few wrong turns
Down a couple back roads
But wound up where
I was supposed to
Making my way
Making my way to you
Baby, I've been
Making my way
Making my way to you

Yeah, a lot of beer got drank
A lot of hell got raised
A lot of nights got long
But that was long
