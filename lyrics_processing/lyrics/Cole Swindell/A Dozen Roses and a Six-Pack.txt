There's that flower shop on Main
Lord, it's been too long since it's seen my face
I probably should've stopped by yesterday
Just a few miles from our house
There's a neon sign flashing "coldest beer in town"
Is she gone for good? Well, it's hard to say
But I'm going to be ready either way

I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
One for every time I left her lonely waiting on me
Why did it take so long to see?
And this six pack might not be enough
But it's a damn good start if we're ending us
We'll either work it out or we won't
But I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
And a six pack if she don't

I'm praying love will bring her back
Oh, just one more chance that's all I'll ever ask
I sure hope she ain't a memory yet
But she left her book there on the bed
Would a woman leave a man like that?

Is she gone for good? Well it's hard to say
But I'm going to be ready either way

I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
One for every time I left her lonely waiting on me, baby
Why'd it take so long to see?
And this six pack might not be enough
But it's a damn good start if we're ending us
We'll either work it out or we won't
But I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
Yeah, I got these dozen roses in case she comes back home
And a six pack if she don't
And a six pack if she don't
