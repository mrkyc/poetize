I could go for a tipsy tailgate kiss
Baby taste the moonshinin' off of your lips
I want to see that 'want ya' smile
Still got me hooked, been hooked for awhile
If you got a bottle you ain't opened yet
And an empty spot beside ya in ya bed
If you got some room for a little regret
Let me know girl I've already left...

If you're feelin' what I'm feelin' let's mix it up
You got my number baby hit me up
If you need a little late night pick me up
I, hope you get lonely tonight
We ain't gotta make up, just kiss me
We could straight up blame it on the whiskey
You ain't gotta wake up and miss me, no
I hope you get lonely tonight

I don't care if you're spinnin' in the neon
Or burnin' up the sheets with my tee on
Either way the thought is turning me on
And I can't shake it girl I'm wide awake, so
