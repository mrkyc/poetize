I wish this whiskey would make her miss me
Like I wish she did, I wish she did
Pouring up another one won't change what I should have done
Before she left, now all that's left is

Mile by mile and
City by city she's
Gettin' over me, and man it ain't pretty, no

She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open
Couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open
Won't pick up her phone
While I'm dying here tonight
Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late

I can't take back what I never said
But if I could, man I would
Try and make her see
That me and Tennessee want her back
I wish it worked like that
Yeah

If I had half a clue
Where she was headed now
I'd do what I had to do
To make her turn that car around

She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open
Couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open
Won't pick up her phone
While I'm dying here tonight
Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late

Yeah, I should've held her close
I should've let her know
How I felt about her 'bout a couple county lines ago

She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open
Couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open
Won't pick up her phone
While I'm dying here tonight
Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late
Yeah
I love you too late
I can't take back what I never said
