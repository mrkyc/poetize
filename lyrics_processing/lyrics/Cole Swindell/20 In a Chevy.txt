Twenty in a Chevy on a two lane

World keeps turning
I keep burning through the night like cigarettes
Country station, blacktop ocean
I ain't shook that summer yet
I'm doing fine like I don't care
Then that song comes on out of nowhere
And I got right back there
Yeah, you're always gonna be

Twenty in a Chevy on a two lane
Hand out the window singing Night Train
July still tastes like your name
Rolling off my lips
Sweat slip, time slips
It's my hands on your hips
It's your lips on my lips
I wonder if you ever miss
Twenty in a Chevy on a two lane

Old school feeling, hay field dreaming
Yeah, we had it all planned out
Hands in your hair, middle of nowhere
Midnight moon beating down
On the hood of my truck, where you used to be
Nothing falling but your hair, the stars and me
Now we're just small town history
Girl, I swear all I see is

Hand out the window singing Night Train
July still tastes like your name
Rolling off my lips
Sweat slip, time slips
It's my hands on your hips
It's your lips on my lips
I wonder if you ever miss
Twenty in a Chevy on a two lane, woah

Yeah, we were twenty in a Chevy on a two lane
The windows fogged up in the hard rain
How the hell did we have such a good thing?
And let it slip away
We let it slip away like

Twenty in a Chevy on a two lane
Hand out the window singing Night Train
July still tastes like your name
Rolling off my lips
Sweat slip, time slips
It's my hands on your hips
It's your lips on my lips
I wonder if you ever miss
