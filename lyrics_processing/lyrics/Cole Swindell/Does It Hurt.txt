Wonderin' what you wanna hear
Every bar stool sayin'

Wish I had my number in it
Then, I could give you a call
And we could talk
If I could find the words
But first things first

Tell me, tell me

Does it feel like work
Keepin' them country boys off of you
Are you tired of runnin'
Through my mind's
Poor boy neighborhood
