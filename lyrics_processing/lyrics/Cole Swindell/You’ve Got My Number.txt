You know where I might be
Any given Saturday night
You know what dress to wear
How to make it look just right
When you walk by
How to smile like you just don't care
You know what drink I like
You know which songs I love
When you hit that dance floor
You know how to mess me up
How to make me love ya
No, girl, it just ain't fair

You've got my number
Yeah, baby, you know me
You've got me wonderin'
How good that it might be
If I could kiss you
Spend a little time with you, girl
You love to drive me
A hundred miles right out of my mind
You love to make me
Think what it might be like
If I could hold ya
But, no, you're just a tease
You've got my number
But you ain't callin' me

I know you remember
We shared that dance one night
Yeah, we got so close
Underneath that neon light
Then, it was over
You said you had to go
But I made you hold up
Put my number in your phone
I thought you'd hit me up
Later, when you got back home
But I never heard from you
And I'm still hangin' on

You've got my number
Yeah, baby, you know me
You've got me wonderin'
How good that end might be
If I could kiss you
Spend a little time with you, girl
You love to drive me
A hundred miles right out of my mind
You love to make me
Think what it might be like
If I could hold ya
But, no, you're just a tease
You've got my number
But you ain't callin' me
Yeah, you've got my number
But you act like
You don't even know me
And girl it ain't right
You push my buttons
And act like it ain't nothin', baby

You've got my number
Yeah, baby, you know me
You've got me wonderin'
How good that end might be
If I could kiss you
Spend a little time with you, girl
You love to drive me
A hundred miles right out of my mind
You love to make me
Think what it might be like
If I could hold ya
But, no, you're just a tease
You've got my number
But you ain't callin' me

Yeah, you've got me fallin'
But, girl, you ain't callin'
