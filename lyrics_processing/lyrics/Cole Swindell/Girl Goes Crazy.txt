He hits her up at midnight
He says, "I miss you," and she says, "I miss you, too"
He's on his way to make it right
She lets him in, then they do what they do
The morning comes, he's already gone
The whole damn day, he don't pick up his phone
There he goes again, messin' with her head
She should be havin' fun, but instead she's

Cryin' in the bathroom, Friday night, Tin Roof
Drinkin' at the thought of him thinkin' 'bout another girl
Save your psychopath
And don't judge that black dress book by the tear-streaked Covergirl
'Cause she's a small-town, mama-lovin', settled down
House on a hill and raise up a couple babies
She's livin' proof that some stupid boy's the only reason a girl goes crazy

He walks in with someone new
And passes by like they ain't got history
She walks up, he says, "Who are you?"
She throws a drink on the shirt he let her sleep in
All them good-for-nothin' times
If only everybody in the bar knew why she's

'Cause she's a small-town, mama-lovin', settled down

She's livin' proof that some stupid boy's the only reason a girl goes crazy, yeah

No, they say that what you see is what you get
'Cause when it's all said and done
Yeah, if anybody's crazy, it's him
Nah, it ain't the one, it ain't the one that's
