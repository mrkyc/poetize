Old school McGraw coming out of my doors
Had to pull over, couldn't take it no more
Got this thing running in park, hazards lighting up the dark
I was just out driving around
Wasn't scanning for a memory to slow me down
But damn, if yours didn't baby
I'd'a paid that DJ not to play it

Cause I'm sitting here knowing what its gonna take to fix me
It ain't a bar, it ain't the beer, it ain't the whiskey
I'd give anything to hear you say you miss me tonight
Yeah, anybody else with any kind of sense
Woulda done moved on, said it is what it is
But I'm off on the shoulder in a mess, all wrecked inside
Baby, I'm broke down and it ain't the truck this time

People slowing down, wanna see what's wrong
I got my hand out the window just waving 'em on
Cause I don't wanna have to explain
Don't want no one to see me this way
Don't need no gas, don't need no ride
Everything on this Chevy is running just right
I just need another minute or two
'Til this song's over like me and you

But I'm off on the shoulder in a mess, all wrecked inside

Yeah anybody else with any kind of sense
Woulda done moved on, but I'm here like this
Off on the shoulder in a mess, all wrecked inside
Yeah, baby, I'm broke down, but it ain't the truck this time
No, it ain't the truck this time

I got nowhere go, nowhere to be
