You wish on 'em, party underneath 'em
Way out there where it's easy to see 'em, stars
Yeah, if they line up, tonight you're gonna
Thank your lucky ones for shining down on you, stars

You stopped and filled up
With a red and black one at the Texaco
She hopped in your truck
Sang along with one on the radio
Big red one going down
Feel like one in a small town
Parked way out in the dark
And they danced on the hood
She was sitting on the shining light
Then gave you that look
They were in her eyes, she couldn't hide 'em
By the end of the night, you were falling just like stars

You stare at 'em, swear if you could reach 'em
You'd give her one 'cause she's got you seeing the stars
Since that night she stole your heart

You stopped and filled up
With a red and black one at the Texaco
She hopped in your truck
Sang along with one on the radio
Big red one going down
Feel like one in a small town
Parked way out in the dark
And they danced on the hood
She was sitting on the shining light
Then gave you that look
They were in her eyes, she couldn't hide 'em
By the end of the night, you were falling just like stars

Since you stopped and filled up
