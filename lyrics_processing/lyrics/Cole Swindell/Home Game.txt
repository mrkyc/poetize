Boot flask full of Jack
Nobody'd look, nobody'd ask
Holding out on a 10 o'clock 12-pack
Win or lose, it didn't matter
Cause soon as those jerseys hit the field
You know that's when it got real
With the rivalries and ride-with-mes
And let-me-know-where-you're-gonna-be's

At the home game, we'd rock
That small town fame in the parking lot
All the pretty girls yelling "Go Big Blue"
Best part never made the front page news
It was under the bleachers
Cigarette stain on my lips from Cowboy Red
And her kiss and all of it, all of it, yeah
Gone in a flash, the times that we had
Got the pictures to prove the good and the bad
It's just what we did and now nothing's changed
They're still falling in love at the home game

TA still on her cheek
Party in a field, she danced with me
That pull you close, bottled up all week
Win or lose, it didn't matter

We had those bragging rights to all those Friday nights
The stadium lights, those stadium lights

At the home game, we'd rock
