Yeah, you got every guy in here
Spinning around spilling their beer
Bet you came out to have a good time
What you say you leave your friends with mine?
Oooh, ooh, yeah, they'll be alright
Ooh, I just wanna see you shine

Girl you're tearing that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Whoa, baby let's go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you parked on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you girl
Yeah, let me see you girl

Whatcha think about taking that chance
Taking a ride, taking my hand
Kicking this crowd, ditching this club?
This night's been waiting on us
Ooh, ooh, save your best moves, ooh, ooh
Yeah, 'til I get us where we're getting to

I can see you getting my tailgate rocking
Moving your hips like wind moves cotton
You can get the whole wide country side hopping

Bring the beat back
Aw, come on with me girl

Yeah, you're tearing that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
