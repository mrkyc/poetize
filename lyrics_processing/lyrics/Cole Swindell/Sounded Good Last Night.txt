When my phone started buzzing
With my buddy saying 'let's paint the town'
It sounded good
When that sexy bartender
Nine or tenner said 'it's two for ones now'
It sounded good

That band cranked up with some Dixieland Delight
That singer might've missed an Alabama note, or five

But it sounded good last night
We had a damn good time
Jack Daniel's got a jackhammer pounding on my mind
Is that my exe's 4-runner backing out the drive
What I told her must've sounded good last night
There's a video of karaoke, me going viral
My fun money funds in a downhill spiral
Right now it sounds bad, y'all, I ain't gonna lie
But it sure sounded good, sounded good last night

'Angel here on earth
Did it hurt?' was my go to line
I thought it sounded good
Round my twelfth twelve ouncer, told the bouncer
'You wanna take it outside?'
He thought it sounded good
That's when they kicked us out
We hit the Texaco
Bought a pack of Black and Milds and some beer from Mexico

'Cause it sounded good last night
We had a damn good time
Jack Daniel's got a jackhammer pounding on my mind
Is that my exe's 4-runner backing out the drive?
What I told her must've sounded good last night
There's a video of karaoke, me going viral
My fun money funds in a downhill spiral
Right now it sounds bad, y'all, I ain't gonna lie
But it sure sounded good, sounded good last night

All the top shelf shops
All the all watch this
All the bad ideas that I never shoulda did

'Cause it sounded good last night
We had a damn good time
Jack Daniel's got that jackhammer pounding on my mind
Is that my exe's 4-runner backing out the drive?
What I told her must've sounded good last night
That video's running up a hundred thousand views
Got a message from my mama said 'I can't believe that you'
I'm contemplating reevaluating my life
But it sure sounded good, sounded good last night like
Nananananana, nananana, yeah
Sure sounded good, sounded good last night
