It's perfect outside, it's like God let me dial up the weather
Got the whole crew here, I ain't seen some of them in forever
It's one of those 'never forget it; better stop and take it in' kind of scenes
Everything's just right, yeah, except for one thing

You should be here
Standing with your arm around me here
Cuttin' up crackin' a cold beer
Sayin' cheers
Hey y'all, it's sure been a good year
It's one of those moments
That's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish
It'd be that you didn't have to miss this
You should be here
(You should be here)

You'd be takin' way too many pictures on your phone
Showin' 'em off to everybody that you know back home
And even some you don't, yeah
They say now you're in a better place
And I would be too if I could see your face
