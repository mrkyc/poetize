Hey y'all, what's going on?
Been waiting on this all day long
When you're up for anything A to Z
No, you don't need no plan B
Go on pop the cord, go on tap the keg
Go on get some red up in your neck
This is one of them nights you just can't miss
And it goes a little, goes a little something like this

Come on now everybody
Whether you're in a bar, in a club
Or just kicking it country style
VIP in the back of a truck

Hey y'all
When the girls walk by we'll be like
Hey y'all
If we get it right they'll be like
Hey y'all
Wanna rock with us tonight?
Hey y'all, damn right

Hey y'all, now what you think?
Got the party rolling like a skating rink
So bottoms up, if you're throwing down
In a big city, small city, anywhere town
I hear you son, I hear you girl
Done got tipsy, like a tilt-a-whirl
Yeah you're dancing going strong
Careful now don't shake it off
