Ain't nothing to the first long night in this empty house alone
The sweetest times of a romance
Will fill your mind the last slow dance
Hold on tight, will you make her be the one to say
It's all gone and you know that it's all gone
The lights go down, the charge is done
The battle is over and the other side won
It don't help to know that it ain't a matter of trying
I'll hold you close one last time
The cost of love might be my mind
It hurts like hell when you're living in a love that's dying
And you know that's it all over but the crying
I remember everything we've done
And the nights when we were one
The silence comes
I can't imagine my life without you
But you've got plans and I've got mine
It's gonna take a long, long time
I hope someday I can smile
And think, how crazy I was about you
So crazy about you
The lights go down, the charge is done
The battle is over and the other side won
It don't help to know that it ain't a matter of trying
I'll hold you close one last time
The cost of love might be my mind
It hurts like hell when you're living in a love that's dying
And you know that's it all over but the crying
You might also likeI don't know the reason
And there's nothing to blame but time
And I've looked into your eyes and they don't lie
The lights go down, the charge is done
The battle is over and the other side won
It don't help to know that it ain't a matter of trying
I'll hold you close one last time
The cost of love might be my mind
It hurts like hell when you're living in a love that's dying
And you know that's it all over but the crying
It all over but the crying, it all over but the crying
