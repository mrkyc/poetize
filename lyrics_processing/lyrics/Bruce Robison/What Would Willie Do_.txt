I heard a voice and it changed my life
And now it's a brand new day
And I ain't ashamed to say
You're not alone, when you're down and out
I think you know who I'm talkin' about
When I don't know how I'll get through
I ask myself, what would Willie do?
Long ago, he came unto us
His words were simple
But they went right through us
And the whole world sang along
But then they didn't want to hear his songs
He was gone, and we thought we'd lost him
But he'd just grew his hair and moved to Austin
And all of the people smiled
They came to hear him sing from miles
And like a miracle all the rednecks and the hippies
From New York city down to Mississippi
Stood together and raised a brew
When its all gone wrong
What would Willie do?
You know sometimes I wonder
When I ain't gettin' nowhere
What would Willie do
When things get too much to bear
I can see him sittin' on his lonely old bus
And he's got his problems just like any of us
I bet he'd just take a deep breath
And he'd let 'em all go
And then he'd take another deep breath
And he'd let 'em all go
And then he'd take another deep breath
And he'd hold it
And then I bet he'd feel hungry
In a way that seems strange
Yes hungry, for all the things he just can't change
You might also likeLike the time he passed out in his own bedroom
And his ex-wife sewed him up in the sheet
And she beat him with a broom
And he forgave her
And you think that that's rough
Then the IRS came and they took away all his stuff
They took his golf course and his recording studio
And he just went on out and did another show
So when it's all coming down on you
I think you'd better ask yourself
What would Willie do?
What would Willie do
Well he'd travel so far with nothing but a song and his old guitar
And a tour bus and some semi-trucks
Thirty crew men and a little bit of luck
He loves all the people, the rank and the randy
If you don't believe it, take a look at the family
They'll tell you that it's true
When it's all too much, what would Willie do?
What would Willie do, he'd take a little time
And talk to old Rooster as they drive on down the line
There's millions down that road
And with a word he's gonna lighten their load
He loves all the people no matter their races
Hell he even made a hit country song with Julio Iglesias
And that ain't easy to do
When it's all too much
When the game gets rough
When they call your bluff
