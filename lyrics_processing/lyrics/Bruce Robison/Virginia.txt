And i watched the tail lights dissappear, your words like old foot prints upon my mind
Yeah your family all was gone
But you couldn't imagine leaving long
You said you only get your life for this one time
But what do i recall when the world was all
But changing in the mirror while im standin like an old stop sign
Yeah "courage" said the man
When you see your whole life turnin out nothin like you'd ever seen or planned
He said "There's always another day, and anyhow that's the only way
It's better just to learn that while you can"
Well would she stay or would she go?
With a girl like that you never know
What's goin on in her heart is hard to define
But I'm inclined to say Virginia, guess you made up your mind
WEll you taught me how to dance, and what it is to take a chance
Theres learning and theres doing, its not the same
Yeah I held when you cried on the morning that your daddy died
If you're livin, you heard theres no one to blame
In hell i do alright but theres times that i can't sleep at night
And i think about things i didn't know stayed with me all this time
But im inclined to say, Virginia, guess you made up your mind
Yeah years go by and you dont come home at all or write
Or call or tell me what you did or didn't find...

Are the stars my whole world just turns around
And i guess shes just like me, and she didn't care to much to see
What life was like outside our little town
Yeah mornings there are some, where i wonder if i've chosen anything that
I've ever done before in my whole life
But thats all behind me now
