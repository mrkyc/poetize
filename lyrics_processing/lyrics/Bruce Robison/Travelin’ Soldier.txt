He was waiting for the bus in his army greens
Sat down in a booth in a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she gave him a smile
So he said would you mind sitting down for a while
And talking to me
I'm feeling a little low
She said I'm off in an hour
And I know where we can go
So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said I bet you got a boyfriend but I don't care
I got no one to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent one back here to you
I cried never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him they told her
Waiting for the love of the travellin soldier
My love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone when the letter says
My soldiers coming home
The letters came from an army camp
In California and Viet Nam
He told her of his heart It might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of
He said when it's getting kinda tough over here
I think of that day sitting down at the pier
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but
I won't be able to write for awhile
I cried never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him they told her
Waiting for the love of the travellin soldier
My love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone when the letter says
My soldiers coming home
SOLO
One Friday night at a football game
The lords prayer said and the anthem sang
The man said
Folks would you bow your head
For the list of local Viet Name dead
Crying all alone under the stands
Was the picolo player in the marching band
And one name read nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair
I cried never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him they told her
Waiting for the love of the travellin soldier
My love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone when the letter says
My soldiers coming
I cried never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him they told her
Waiting for the love of the travellin soldier
My love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone when the letter says
