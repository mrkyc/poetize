Sometimes I get to thinking
'bout the girls I knew
Lips all painted and pointy shoes
And it feels so damn strange, I can't remember their names
There was the one with the car and the one with the hair
And the one with the shirt stuck clean down to there
And I feel so dang fortunate - That's the word I'm looking for

Comb my hair, walkin' the line
Doin' er'ything to make her mind all mine
Nobody does nothing quite the way you do

You're the only lips that I'd ever wanna kiss
Only kiss that I'd ever wanna miss
Only Miss that I'd ever wanna sing this song
You're the only baby that I'd ever wanna love
Only girl I'll never get tired of
Girl I wanna love you every minute till they call me home

Sometimes I get to thinking 'bout the night we met
Though you maintain, we ain't met yet
And you were so cold, it about broke my heart
Well I got real drunk, ended up in jail
Y'didn't even tell me you paid my bail
And it was you there darling, and I'm still so grateful

Told your ma
Told your pa
Told your brother, 'bout broke my jaw
And I don't blame him
'Cause I'm telling the world

You're the only lips that I'd ever wanna kiss
Only kiss that I'd ever wanna miss
Only Miss that I'd ever wanna sing this song
You're the only baby that I'd ever wanna love
Only girl I'll never get tired of
Girl I wanna love you every minute till they call me home (call me home)

Yeah, Told your ma
Told your pa
Told your brother, 'bout broke my jaw
And I don't blame him
'Cause I'm telling the world

You're the only lips that I'd ever wanna kiss
Only kiss that I'd ever wanna miss
Only Miss that I'd ever wanna sing this song
You're the only baby that I'd ever wanna love
Only girl I'll never get tired of
Girl I wanna love you every minute till they call me home
Girl I wanna love you every minute till they call me home
