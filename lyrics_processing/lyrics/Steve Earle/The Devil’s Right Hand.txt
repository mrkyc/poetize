About the time that Daddy left to fight the big war
I saw my first pistol in the general store
In the general store when I was thirteen
Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen

I asked if I could have one someday when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up
She really blew up, I didn't understand
Mama said, "The pistol is the devil's right hand"

The devil's right hand
The devil's right hand
Mama said, "The pistol is the devil's right hand"

My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt
Shoot as fast as lightning but she loads a mite slow
Loads a mite slow and soon I found out
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out

So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45
Called a Peacemaker, but I never knew why
Never knew why, I didn't understand
Mama said, "The pistol is the devil's right hand"

Mama said, "The pistol is the devil's right hand"

1:38 - 1:53

Well I got into a card game in a company town
Caught a miner cheatin'
I shot the dog down
Shot the dog down
I watched the man fall
Never touched his holster
Never had a chance to draw

My trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, "Not guilty," I said
"Not guilty", I said, "you've got the wrong man"
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand
The devil's right hand
Mama said, "The pistol is the devil's right hand"

The devil's right hand
The devil's right hand
Nothin' touched the trigger
But the devil's right hand
