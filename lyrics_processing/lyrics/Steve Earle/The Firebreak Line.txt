Well, I'm a-cuttin' out a firebreak line
Cuttin' out a firebreak line
Digging down deep to the clay and lime
Cuttin' out a firebreak line

Well I'm a wildfire fighting fool
On the Yellow Mountain hotshot crew
I can swamp and fell
I can walk through hell
I'm an EMT and a torch-man too
When the wind's blowin' hot and dry
And the sparks and the cinders fly
I'll make my stand with twenty good men
A better band of brother's you'll never find
Got their back and they got mine
I'm cuttin' out a firebreak line

Well, I'm cuttin' out a firebreak line
Cuttin' out a firebreak line
Digging down deep to the clay and lime
I'm cuttin' out a firebreak line

Ed Pulaski is a friend of mine
When I'm cuttin' out a firebreak line
He invented this thing like an ax I swing
And he never left a member of his crew behind
When the fire jumped across the line
Took 'em down an abandoned mine
Then he drew his gun, said he'd shoot the first one
That got it in his head to try and step outside
Got everybody out alive
Ed Pulaski is a friend of mine

Gotta pray that the wind'll die
And it rains down from on high
I will raise a glass to the hotshots past
In hotshot heaven up above the sky
They're watchin' over me when I'm
Cuttin' out a firebreak line

Now I'm cuttin' out a firebreak line
Cuttin' out a firebreak line
Digging down deep to the clay and lime
I'm cuttin' out a firebreak line
Whoa I'm cuttin' out a firebreak line
Cuttin' out a firebreak line
I'm digging down deep to the clay and lime
