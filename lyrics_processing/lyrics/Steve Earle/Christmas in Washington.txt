It's Christmas time in Washington
The Democrats rehearsed
Getting into gear for four more years
Things not getting worse
The Republicans drink whiskey neat
And thanked their lucky stars
They said, "He cannot seek another term
They'll be no more FDRs"
And I sat home in Tennessee
Just staring at the screen
With an uneasy feeling in my chest
I'm wondering what it means

So come back, Woody Guthrie
Now, come back to us now
Tear your eyes from paradise
And rise again somehow
If you run into Jesus
Maybe he can help you out
Come back, Woody Guthrie
To us now

I followed in your footsteps once
Back in my traveling days
Somewhere I failed to find your trail
Now I'm stumbling through the haze
But there's killers on the highway now
And a man can't get around
So I sold my soul for wheels that roll
Now I'm stuck here in this town

Come back, Woody Guthrie
Come back to us now
Tear your eyes from paradise
And rise again somehow
If you run into Jesus
Maybe he can help us out
Come back, Woody Guthrie
To us now

There's foxes in the henhouse
Cows out in the corn
The unions have been busted
Their proud red banners torn
To listen to the radio
You'd think that all was well
But you and me and Cisco know
It's going straight to hell

So come back, Emma Goldman
Rise up, old Joe Hill
The barricades are going up
They cannot break our will
Come back to us, Malcolm X
And Martin Luther King
We're marching into Selma
As the bells of freedom ring
So come back, Woody Guthrie
Come back to us now
Tear your eyes from paradise
