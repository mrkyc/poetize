And i know, what you don't know
What it is, that makes you act this way
Well you can change your ways
And i have found, your all alone
You remonis upon your glory days
That was just a passing phase
Bridge
Well castles in the sky, sweet lullaby
They sign their vide into your bitter times
When words were hard to find
Chorus
And come fly away
Let go of all your pain, and hear these words and say
Its over
Well come fly away
We're free from all your change, and hear my voice and say
V2
Cause i have things
And death begins, this lonely journey to the other side
Though the turbo's so high
And lay you down, your soul tonight
It's been too long since you have even tried
To open up your mind
The end of every march, december, may
They leave you dreaming for another day
These wishes all the way

And come fly away
Let go of all your pain, and hear these words and say
Its over
Well come fly away
We're free from all your change, and hear my voice and say
I dont want a reason to believe in all the seasons
They just cover up your pain, you hold inside
............ us
We should come to all thats past us
And the cost of our emotions till we die
It's over
Its okay
It's not gonna be the same
You gotta fly away
And come fly away
Let go of all your pain, and hear these words and say
Its over
Well come fly away
We're free from all your change, and hear my voice and say
And come fly away
Let go of all your pain, and hear these words and say
Its over
Well come fly away
We're free from all your change, and hear my voice and say
