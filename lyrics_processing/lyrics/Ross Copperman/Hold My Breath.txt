You're breaking my heart
Breaking my soul
Taking everything
I can't control
And want me to beg
And want me to scream
You hold me back so I can't escape
But I don't wanna hold my breath
Toss my penny's in a wishing well
Believe in fortunes I can't tell
Cause this is my life
I won't let them get inside my mind
I don't wanna fall one step behind
Lose my place at the finish line
Cause this is my time
And I don't wanna hold my breath
(I don't wanna hold my, I don't wanna hold my, I don't wanna hold my breath)
(I don't wanna hold my, I don't wanna hold my, I don't wanna hold my breath)
I swam into the ocean deep
The waves they tried to bury me
But I was strong
I was brave
They pushed me down
But I escaped
But I don't wanna hold my breath
Toss my penny's in a wishing well
Believe in fortunes I can't tell
Cause this is my life
I won't let them get inside my mind
I don't wanna fall one step behind
Lose my place at the finish line
Cause this is my time
And I don't wanna hold my breath
(I don't wanna hold my, I don't wanna hold my, I don't wanna hold my breath)
(I don't wanna hold my, I don't wanna hold my, I don't wanna hold my breath)
I don't wanna hold my breath
Toss my penny's in a wishing well
Believe in fortunes I can't tell
Cause this is my life
I won't let them get inside my mind
I don't wanna fall one step behind
Lose my place at the finish line
Cause this is my time
And I don't wanna hold my breath
(I don't wanna hold my, I don't wanna hold my, I don't wanna hold my breath)
(I don't wanna hold my, I don't wanna hold my, I don't wanna hold my breath)
I don't wanna hold my Breath
(I don't wanna hold my, I don't wanna hold my, I don't wanna hold my breath)
(I don't wanna hold my, I don't wanna hold my, I don't wanna hold my breath)
