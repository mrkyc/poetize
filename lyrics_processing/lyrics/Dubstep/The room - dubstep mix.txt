To let the whole world to get up and get down
Forget the radio, I got my gramophone
So bring your Marvin, Aretha and James Brown
I got the beat to make you sick with the kicks now
I got the beat to make you shake your tail feather
Lets take it back, old school, hip hop, come on now
Well mix it all together
I said boom, boom, then you shaking the room
I said boom, boom, then you shaking the room
Boom, boom, shake, shake the room
Boom, boom, baby shaking the room
I said lady shake your tail feather
Shake it night and day
Boom, boom, then you shaking the room
Hey ladies, get in your mammas closet
Pull out a chic dress, with a locket on it
And fellows, put on a sharp suit
And well be rocking our look right, get sexy too
And there ain't no better feeling
Like when youre twisting, hitch hocking to the groove and jiving
I wanna throw a Donatina
So come on everybody say yeah
I said boom, boom, then you shaking the room
I said boom, boom, then you shaking the room
Boom, boom, shake, shake the room
Boom, boom, baby shaking the room
I said lady shake your tail feather
Shake it night and day
Boom, boom, then you shaking the room
Yeah, now, baby, yeah, come on now
Shake your boom boom, shake your boom boom
Come on, put your hands together
We got a beat that will make you hit the floor
Make you wanna ask for more
We spinning round in circles, baby making you dizzy for sure
Cause we got those lips blazing
We standing here arisen
And you can never stop this old school party crazy
Shake you tail feather, shake it night and day
I said boom, boom, then you shaking the room
I said boom, boom, then you shaking the room
Boom, boom, shake, shake the room
Boom, boom, baby shaking the room
I said lady shake your tail feather
Shake it night and day
