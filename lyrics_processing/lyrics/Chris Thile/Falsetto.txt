From worry to despair
It's only been two weeks and there's a lifetime
Of friendships to repair between America and everybody else
'Cause Froggy went a courtin' and he thinks it went well
Says "Buddy, if you say it didn't, you can go to hell
With your movies and your marches
Your speeches and your silly songs
And your girly falsetto
Girly falsetto falling from the highest heights
And the ribbons running through your vibey vintage mics..."
I try to look away from my timeline
But I see it everywhere
Another diatribe
In 140 characters to stare at wondering when he's gonna crack
'Cause Froggy thinks his whistle is the Liberty Bell
Says "Buddy, if you say it isn't, you can go to hell
With your viva la resistance, your facts, and your stupid songs
And your girly falsetto
Girly falsetto falling from the highest heights
And the ribbons running through your vibey vintage mics 'cause
Everything is going great you should be super psyched

Don't tell it like it was
Just tell it like I want it to be
Don't tell it like it is
Don't tell it like it was
I try to brighten up my timeline
With Roger's 18th slam
I'm so enamored of him
God above can't hit his ground strokes with that kind of grace --
"Shut up and sing in falsetto
Sing in falsetto falling from the highest heights
Like the ribbons running through your vibey vintage mics
'Cause everything is going great you should be super psyched
Put the false in falsetto
Let your voice go gentle into this good night
The further up it goes the faster it can fall in line
You entertainers need to keep the entertainment light
Don't tell it like it is
Entertainers better keep the entertainment light
Don't tell it like it was
Entertainers better keep the entertainment light
Just tell it like I want it to be
Don't tell it like it is
Entertainers better keep the entertainment light
Don't tell it like it was
Entertainers better keep the entertainment light
Just tell it like I want it to be"
