The sun's not up
Father take away this cup
It's running through my throbbing head
Because if he had I'd be dead
Feeling like I'm feeling now
In between the skies and clouds
Where everyone's identity is just a picture card they need
I came from California with an appetite for my own myths
Music, love, and what they mean
I'm told it's borderline obscene
I tried to write this song before
But had no one to write it for
My fellow travelers vacant stares
Leave it up for you to care
I could write a song and have the Lord put you and me in a cup he tries to pour out
Looking in at the passengers from the wing
I'm nowhere and you're everything
(I'm nowhere and you're everything)
You came from Illinois with a cup of your very own to sip
Never on route for very long
Just there and doing something wrong
Or so your friends and parents said
But if you hadn't you'd be dead
What you've been given doesn't scare me
All your sights and sounds prepare me

Damn this cup
Bring me a bowl
If I can't saturate my soul
With you and him who drank it first
And last I'm ready for the worst
It's way past two and you want me there
Well he needs me here
So you have to share
I'm crying 'cause I'm in love with you
You're crying 'cause you have no clue
I could write a song and have the Lord put you and me in a cup he tries to pour out
Looking in at the passengers from the wing
I'm nowhere and you're everything
