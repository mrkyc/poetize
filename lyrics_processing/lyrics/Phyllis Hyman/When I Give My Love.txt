This time
I'm gonna make it last forever more
And when I give my love this time
I'm gonna give it all I got for sure
No more mistakes that's my resolution
Lord knows I've been through so many changes
Stick to the path that's the solution
It's for sure I won't go wrong
At last I've found someone
Someone that I can trust
Feel good about myself
Feel like nobody else
When I give my love
This time
I'm gonna make it last forever more
And when I give my love
This time
I'm gonna think it through and be for sure
Follow the book that's my intention
The book of life
The book of love
To be hurt by love is too painful to mention
But you learn from experience
At last I got someone
Someone I can trust
Feel good about myself
Feel like nobody else
Ooo baby
When I give myself this time
I'm gonna give it all I've got for sure
(Last forever) I'm gonna make it last
I'm gonna make it last
(Last forever) Yeah-yeah-yeah
Giving my love to you baby
(giving my love to you)
Oh gonna make it last
(giving up, giving up)
Forever more
(Giving up, Giving up_
I'm gonna make it last
I'm gonna make it last
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Ooo when I give my love this time
Oooo...forever and ever
When I give my love (Next time I give my love) I'm gonna think it through
And be for sure
I will have my eyes open baby
Yeah-yeah
Yes I will
Never take advantage of my love
For you baby
Got my eyes on you
Ooo...when I give my love to you baby yeah
I'm gonna make it last
Forever and ever
Oh forever more
And I'm gonna give it all I have for sure
Hey...I won't go wrong

Someone that I can trust
Forever and ever
Last forever and ever
