Don't turn away
Don't run and hide
It scares me too
Each time we fight
We get so close
And suddenly
We're far away
As we can be

There's a chance
A chance we have to take
There's a choice for us
A choice we have to make
What love demands is honesty
I'm here for you
Now don't you see

It takes two
For a relationship to be
Everything we need
To feel complete
Two (Don't you know)
For love to make it through the hardest times
We'll go through
It takes two
You might also like
Have some faith
In what we feel
In time our love
Will be revealed
Open up
That cautious heart
And let me in
So we can start

There's a chance
A chance we have to take
There's a choice for us
A choice we have to make
What love demands is honesty
I'm here for you
Now don't you see

It takes two
For a relationship to be
Everything we need (Everything we need)
To feel complete
Two (It takes two, my baby)
For love to make it through the hardest times
We'll go through (We'll go through)
It takes two

It takes two (It takes two)
For a relationship to be (To be)
Everything we need (Everything we need)
To feel complete (Oh oh)
Two (It takes two)
For love to make it through the hardest times
We'll go through (Ooh)
It takes two (It takes two)
It takes two (Hey, hey, you know it does)
For a relationship to be (To be)
Everything we need (Everything we need)
To feel complete (Complete)
Two
For love to make it through the hardest times
We'll go through
It takes two (Hey, hey)
It takes two (It takes two)
For a relationship to be (For this to be)
Everything we need (Everything we need)
To feel complete (To feel complete)
Two
For love to make it through the hardest times
We'll go through (To make it through)
