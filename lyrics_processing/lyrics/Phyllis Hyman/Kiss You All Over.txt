When I get home, babe
Gonna light the fire
All day I've been thinking about you
You're my one desire
Gonna wrap my arms around you
Hold you close to me
Oh babe, I wanna feel your lips
I wanna be your fantasy, yeah
Don't know what I'd do without you
Don't know what I need
And not just another lover
You're everything to me
Every time I'm with you, boy
Can't believe it's true
When you lay in my arms
And we do the things we do

You can see it in my eyes
I can feel it in your touch
You don't have to say a thing
Just let me show how much
Love you...
Need you...
You might also like
I wanna kiss you all over
All over again
I wanna kiss you all over
'Til the night closes in
'Til the night closes in
'Til the night closes in

No one else could ever make me feel the way you do
Oh, keep on loving me, baby, and I'll keep loving you
It's easy to see when something's right or something's wrong
Oh, oh, stay with me and hold me all night long

You can see it in my eyes
I can feel it in your touch
You don't have to say a thing
Just let me show how much
Love you...
Need you...

I wanna kiss you all over
All over again
I wanna kiss you all over
'Til the night closes in
'Til the night closes in
'Til the night closes in
Stay with me, lay with me
Holding me, loving me, baby
Dear with me, near with me
Feeling close to me, baby
Show me, show me everything you do
'Cause baby, no one does it quite like you
Love you...
Need you...

I wanna kiss you all over
All over again
I wanna kiss you all over
'Til the night closes in
'Til the night closes in
'Til the night closes in, yeah, oh
I wanna kiss you all over
All over again
I wanna kiss you all over
'Til the night, 'til the night closes in
