True love, so hard to hold to
Lost in a love affair
How could you let her control you
Did I hear you say
"We'd work it out some way"?
Sweet dreams and times of laughter
We could've have it all
But my dreams are all that she's after
Wish that it would
Say I misunderstood some way

I got to leave you
But love don't wanna let love get away (Get away)
Some way (Some way, some way)
I don't wanna lose you
But I'm not gonna let you get away (Get away)
Some way (Some way, some way)
Oh, she's gonna use you
Break your heart and leave you, get away (Get away)
Some way (Some way, some way)
Some way, some way, some way we can make it

Tell me it's not over
Now after all these years
Take back the lines that you told her
So won't you stay?
Please wash away my tears
Don't let forever after
Turn into yesterday
Can we try and recapture
The joy that we knew
Just me and you some way
You might also like
I got to leave you
But love don't wanna let love get away (Get away)
Some way (Some way, some way)
I don't wanna lose you
But I'm not gonna let you get away (Get away)
Some way (Some way, some way)
Oh, she's gonna use you
Break your heart and leave you, get away (Get away)
Some way (Some way, some way)
Oh, some way, some way, some way we can make it

Oh, oh, oh, oh
We can make it oh oh (We can make it)
We can make it, yes, we can
Oh, some way, some way, some way we can make it
Oh, it's not over, I know, it's not over, baby
(We can make it)
I won't let you get away, some way
