Ooh, ooh, ooh
Don't want nobody
I don't want nobody
No one, no one, no one but you

I don't want no one but you
I don't want no one but you
I don't want no one (No one) but you to love me

I'd rather be lonely
All by myself
Sitting until you come home
No other arms could hold me the way you do

Baby, can't you see, I'm devoted to you
Baby, can't you see, I'm committed to you
Can't you see that I'm yours
And yours alone

I don't want no one but you
I don't want no one but you
I don't want no one (No one) but you to love me
You might also like
Love me so good
You're so right for me
I'm at my best when I'm with you
I give to you all the love that I have to give

Honey, can't you see, I'm devoted to you
Baby, can't you see, I'm committed to you
Can't you see that I'm yours
And yours alone

I don't want no one but you
I don't want no one but you
I don't want no one (No one) but you to love me (To love me)

Ooh, I don't want no one
Don't want nobody to love me, baby, but you
Don't want nobody to put their hands on me but you
Oh, but you, baby
I don't, I don't want nobody but you, sweet darling, to love me
Don't you know I don't want nobody, don't you know, hey, hey
I don't want nobody, don't want nobody, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Don't want nobody, but you to love me
Don't want nobody, uh uh, uh uh, no no
Don't want nobody
Don't want nobody, ooh, but you to love me
I want you, I want you
