Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

I haven't heard from you
I really need for you to want me, too
I don't know, I can't say
That you could ever have me, baby
Hey, hey, hey

I can't go on this way
Feeling all alone

Tell me what you're gonna do
I'll see you through if you really want me to
Tell me what you're gonna do
Treat me right and I'll do anything for you

I'm moving on, I'm outta here
I've got a life
I don't you see, my dear
I don't need this pain
Driving me insane
Please be good to me, hey hey hey
You might also like
I can't go on this way
Don't make me wait too long

Tell me what you're gonna do
I'll see you through if you really want me to
Tell me what you're gonna do
Treat me right and I'll do anything for you
Tell me what you're gonna do
I'll see you through if you really want me to, baby
Tell me what you're gonna do
Treat me right and I'll do anything for you

Hey, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey
Darling, tell me what you're gonna do
What are your intentions (What do you want?)
We have lost direction (Now that you've gone)
From the very day we met
Show me some affection (Show it to me)
My heart needs protection (That's what I need)
From this loneliness I'm feeling inside
Oh, oh

Tell me what you're gonna do
I'll see you through if you really want me to
Tell me what you're gonna do
Treat me right and I'll do anything for you

I need to know it
(Tell me what you're gonna do)
You've got to show it
Don't keep me hanging on
Or I'll be gone, gone, gone
(Tell me what you're gonna do)
Don't mistreat me
Come on, baby, if you need me
(Tell me what you're gonna do)
I'll see you, I'll see you through
(Tell me what you gonna do)
I'll see you, I'll see you through
I need to know it
