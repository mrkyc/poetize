J-J-J-J-J-Just wanna be your girl
J-J-J-J-J-Just wanna be your...
Don't wanna change it
Ah, ah, ah

They know I ain't no saint, I ain't no politician
Baby, that's not my way
I just wanna be the one you give your love to
Each and every day

Since I saw you, boy, I've only got one ambition
That's to win your heart
Ain't no better cause, don't give me no other mission
I've got to have you home

Don't wanna change the world
I just wanna be your girl
Don't wanna change the world
I just wanna be your girl
Don't wanna change it

I used to spend my time just working for a dollar
Never had too much fun
I'll be working steady building up my power
The power of one

But since I saw you, boy, I've only got one ambition
That's to win your heart
Ain't no better cause, don't give me no other mission
I've got to have you home

Don't wanna change the world
I just wanna be your girl
Don't wanna change the world (Don't want to change the world)
I just wanna be your girl (I wanna be, I wanna be your girl)
Don't wanna change the world (I don't wanna change the world)
I just wanna be your girl (Ooh, I wanna be your girl)
Don't wanna change the world (Don't wanna change the world)
I just wanna be your girl

Some folks live their lives with only one desire
Seeking fortune and fame
Seems they only wanna set the world on fire
That's right for them, but that's not my game, ooh
Don't wanna change it
As I appear to glare, stare deep into your eyes
Mesmerized by the ties that hold us together
Wishful thinking, me and you one-on-one, lovers, friends forever
Give me the chance to romance and I remind you
You've got a serious future behind you
So come on over here, girl, and do as you please
And don't sweatin' me for checkin' out your groceries
Why do I sweat when I got the juice?
I'm just a girl with a plan, nothin' on the loose
You see, you're the kind of man that needs my affection
My love and protection, but to be a perfection
Don't be frontin' on me, you know who I am
And other sisters you do just don't give a damn
So brother, I don't want to change your world
All I want to do is be your girl
Understand what I'm sayin'?
I want to be your girl, ooh
Don't wanna change the world, I wanna be your girl

Don't wanna change the world (Don't want to change the world)
I just wanna be your girl (I wanna be, I wanna be your girl)
Don't wanna change the world (I don't wanna change the world)
I just wanna be your girl
Don't wanna change the world (Don't wanna change)
Just wanna be your girl (I wanna be, I wanna be)
Don't wanna change the world (Don't wanna change)
I just wanna be your girl (I don't want to change the world)
Don't wanna change the world (I don't wanna change the world)
Just wanna be your girl
(I just wanna be, just wanna be, yeah)
Don't wanna change the world (Don't wanna change it)
I just wanna be your girl
Don't wanna change the world (Don't wanna change it)
