Ooh, hey
Oh yeah

It's almost 4 AM
And I'm all by myself
I'm wondering when you've been
And are you in love with someone else
It's such a fine affair
We almost had it all
We grow old once and then
It's colder now in any weather

I've been waiting
Here at the gates of heaven
Waiting for us
To forgive and get together

(Gotta get back to paradise)
Tell me what do I need to do
(Gotta get back to paradise)
'Cause I'm so in love with you
Can we find a way to put the past away
To start it all anew
(Gotta get back, gotta get back)
Yeah
You might also like
Distant as a star
Come on talk to me
And take me to your heart
'Cause I've been waiting paitently
We can start a fire
Warm it by degrees
'Til we build it up
To the love we had together

I've been waiting
Here at the gates of heaven
Waiting for us
To forgive and get together

(Gotta get back to paradise)
Tell me what do I need to do
(Gotta get back to paradise)
'Cause I'm so in love with you
Can we find a way to put the past away
And start it all anew
(Gotta get back, gotta get back)
Ooh, yeah
(Find a way) I got to find a way
(To your heart) To your heart, my darling
(Let's retrace our steps) Along the way
And find the place where we went wrong
We gotta get back to where we belong
Oh, oh, we gotta find a way to get back to where, where we belong
Oh

(Gotta get back to paradise)
Tell me what do I need to do, yeah
(Gotta get back to paradise)
'Cause I'm so in love with you
Can we find a way to put the past away
And start it all anew
(Gotta get back to paradise)
Gotta get back, gotta get back, ah, hey
(Gotta get back to paradise)
Tell me what am I gonna do, my baby
Can we find a way to put the past away
And start it all anew
(Gotta get back, gotta get back)
Ooh
(Gotta get back to paradise)
I gotta get back, gotta get back
(Gotta get back to paradise)
Tell me what we're gonna do
(Gotta get back to paradise)
I gotta get back, my baby, gotta get back, baby
(Gotta get back to paradise)
Tell me what do I need to do
(Gotta get back to paradise)
Gotta get back to paradise
(Gotta get back to paradise)
Tell me what do I need to do
(Gotta get back to paradise)
I'm so in love with you
(Gotta get back to paradise)
Yeah, oh
