Settin' it, settin' it, setting a trap for you, baby
(Verse 1)
Yes I set my little trap for you
How could you know it didn't show
Yes I set my little trap for you
I fell in love with you when we met
You were my kind of guy
You were with someone I didn't know
I'll find you later when she's gone
When just by coincidence
We'll be walking on air
(Verse 2)
Yes I set my little trap for you
Unaware I didn't care
Yes I set my little trap for you
Like a candle fly around a flame
I had to learn it could burn
I was fascinated by the glow
Must have seemed crazy, I suppose
The first time we touch was too much
The trap was closed
You might also likeYes I set my little trap for you
But your eyes hypnotized
Yes I set my little trap for you
Settin' it, settin' it, settin' it
Settin' it, settin' it, settin' a trap for you, baby
You've been on my mind
So I responded in kind
Had to get it right baby
I couldn't play it fair
Thought you didn't care
All is fair in love
Until you get enough
Had to set it right, baby
Must have seemed crazy, I suppose
The first time we touch was too much
The trap was closed
Settin' it, settin' it, settin' it
Settin' it, settin' it, setting a trap for you, baby
I couldn't play it fair
Thought you didn't care
All is fair in love
Until you get enough
Had to set it right, baby
Yes I set my little trap for you
How could you know it didn't show
Yes I set my little trap for you
Settin' it, settin' it, settin' it
Settin' it, settin' it, setting a trap for you, baby
Ooh settin' it, settin' it, settin' it
Settin' it, settin' it, setting a trap for you, my pretty baby
You've been on my mind
So I responded in kind
Had to get it right baby
Yes I set my little trap for you
But your eyes hypnotized
Yes I set my little trap for you
Settin' it, settin' it, settin' it
Settin' it, settin' it, setting a trap for you, baby
Settin' it, settin' it, settin' it
