Measure for measure
Your love's so much pleasure
Like a haunting melody
You came inside and captured me
And I'm so happy
You're the riddle of my rhyme
You and I together
We'll stand the test of time

You know how to love me (Sure you do)
You know to make it right (So nice)
You know how to love me (There's no denyin')
Sweet as the morning light

Sooner or later
I knew you'd come my way
You're welcome to my love
Just promise that you'll stay, yeah

You know how to love me
Right in a special way
You know how to love me
Tonight all I wanna say
You know how to love me
You're the real that I feel, never go away

Ain't nothin' deceivin'
'Bout the way that I'm loving you, yeah

You know how to love me (You know, you know)
You know to make it right (I can feel it)
You know how to love me (No doubt about it)
Sweet as the morning light

Nothing's forever
That's what people say
But each time we're together
Forever and a day, yeah

You know how to love me
Right in a special way
You know how to love me
Tonight all I wanna say
You know how to love me
You're the real that I feel, never go away
