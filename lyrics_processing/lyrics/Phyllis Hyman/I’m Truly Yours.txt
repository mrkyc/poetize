And with this ring
I do thee wed
The sacred words
Have all been said
Baby, when I told you
I was truly yours

I wasn't joking
I wasn't playing
I knew exactly what I was saying
I meant every word

No matter what life
Takes us through
It will never change
The way I feel about you
'Cause when I told you
I was truly yours

I wasn't faking
I wasn't fooling
I knew exactly what I was doing
I meant every word
From the bottom of my heart
I meant it, every word
Put my whole life in it
Gave you my all
You might also like
Folks thought they'd never see the day
They thought I'd kiss and run away
Now they see I meant every word I said

I wasn't joking
I wasn't playing
I knew exactly what I was saying
I meant every word
From the bottom of my heart
I meant it, every word
Put my whole life in it
Gave you my all

And as the years go passing by
Our love will grow
It will never die
'Cause when I told
I was forever yours
I wasn't joking
I wasn't fooling
I knew exactly what I was doing
I meant every word

I wasn't faking
I wasn't playing (Playing)
I knew exactly what I was saying
I wasn't joking
I wasn't fooling
I knew exactly what I was doing
(I knew what I was doing, doing)
I wasn't joking
I wasn't playing (Playing)
I knew exactly what I was saying
I wasn't faking
I wasn't fooling
I knew exactly what I was doing
(I knew what I was doing, doing)
I wasn't joking
I wasn't playing
I knew exactly what I was saying
(I knew exactly, yeah)
I wasn't faking (I wasn't faking)
I wasn't fooling (I wasn't fooling)
I knew exactly what I was doing
I wasn't joking (I wasn't joking)
I wasn't playing (I wasn't playing, baby)
I knew exactly what I was saying
I wasn't faking
I wasn't fooling
