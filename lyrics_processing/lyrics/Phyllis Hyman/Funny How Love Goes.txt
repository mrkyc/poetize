Funny how love goes
I wish I had never met you
(Damon)
I wish I had never seen your face
(Phyllis)
Cause now I can't forget you
(Damon)
The memory of you is too much for me to take
(Phyllis)
There was a time when you were mine
I couldn't wait to see you, hold you in my arms
(Damon)
Oh how I would yearn
And my heart would burn with love for you, you
(Phyllis)
You and me we got along so good
I thought our love would last forever
(Damon)
Suddenly things changed
Now the mere mention of your name
You might also like(Phyllis)
Makes me sad and blue
Oh I'm missing you
(Phyllis)
Funny how love goes
I wish I had never met you
(Damon)
I wish you had never come into my life
(Phyllis)
If I could just forget you
I know that everything would be alright
Everything would be alright
Late at night when I'm fast asleep
I can hear you calling out my name
(Damon)
When will it end
(Phyllis)
There's no need to pretend
I still love you the same
Ooh yes I do
(Damon)
If I could just put my pride aside
I'd come running back to you
(Phyllis)
But I know it wouldn't do any good
Because I did the best I could
It would be the same thing again
Oh, oh yeah
(Phyllis)
Funny how love goes
I wish I had never met you
(Damon)
I wish I had never tasted your love
(Phyllis)
Cause now I can't forget you
The memory of you is too much for me to take
(Phyllis & Damon)
Funny how love goes
(Damon)
Funny how love goes
(Phyllis)
Funny how love goes
(Damon)
Funny how love goes
(Phyllis)
Talking about you baby
(Damon)
I can't, I can't
(Damon)
I can't baby
Love, love, love, love
