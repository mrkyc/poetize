It's over, it's over
Don't tell me, tell her
It's over, it's over
Whenever said this love was forevermore
But in my heart you came and I close the door
And now I see that "sorry girl" look in your eyes
I know she's back in town again, don't bring her back in our lives
Don't tell me, tell her 
It's over , it's over
Don't tell me, tell her 
It's over , it's over
Don't tell me, tell her
It's o---ver--- Oooh..
Whenever you call
Ain't I the one who always takes the time to be with you, be with you?
Whenever you fall
Ain't I the one who always been right there to pick you up
And turn your grey skies blue?
(Don't let go) Don't let go of me, baby
(Don't you know) I'd be lost without you
(Turn Around) Turn around and come back here
Please don't say we're through
Don't tell me, tell her 
It's over, it's over
Don't tell me, tell her
It's over, it's over
Don't let go (Don't let go, baby)
Don't you know (Don't you know, baby)
Turn around
Everything you need is here
Don't tell me, tell her 
It's over, it's over
Don't tell me, tell her 
It's over , it's over
Don't tell me, tell her 
It's over, it's over 
Don't tell me, tell her 
It's over, it's over 
Don't tell me, tell her
It's over, it's over
(Don't let go) Don't let go of me, baby
(Don't you know) I'd be lost without you
(Turn around) Turn around and come back here
Please don't say we're through
Don't tell me, tell her
It's over, it's over
Don't tell me, tell her
It's over, it's over
Don't tell me, tell her 
It's over, it's over
Don't tell me, tell her 
It's over , it's over
(Don't let go) Don't let go of me, baby
(Don't you know) I'd be lost without you
(Turn around) Turn around and come back here
Please don't say we're through
Don't tell me, tell her
It's over, it's over
Don't tell me, tell her
It's over, it's over
Don't tell me, tell her
It's over, it's over
Don't tell me, tell her
