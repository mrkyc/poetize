Can't we fall in love again?
Can't we fall in love again?

We were known as the great lovers
We had the magic from the start
We had so much to give each other
Now you're tellin' me you've lost the spark

Ooh, hold on tight, don't turn out the light
Can't we fall in love again?
With all of my might, I'll try to make things right
Can't we fall in love again?

Oh, babe, I thought I couldn't live without you, baby
But, oh, how the months have flown so fast
By chance we meet and magic's happenin' once again
The second time around let's make it last

Come on, darlin'
Hold on tight, don't turn out the light
Can't we fall in love again?
With all of our might, let's try to make things right
We can do it darling
Can't we fall in love again? In love again
You might also like
So we live, and so it goes, baby
How it will turn out, no one knows
But here we go, babe

Oh baby, can't we fall in love again?
Let's hold on tight, don't turn out the light
Can't we fall in love again?
With all of my might I wanna hold you real tight, baby
Can't we fall in love again?
Hold on tight, don't turn out the light
Can't we fall in love again?
There's somethin' I've been wantin' to talk to you about
Come on, you gotta talk to me, baby
Can't we fall in love again?
Ooh babe, can't we fall in love again?
You got the magic in your eyes
I'm waitin' for my surprise, baby
Hey, you got it, baby
Can't we fall in love?
Hold on tight, don't turn out the light
Can't we fall in love again?
With all of that good stuff...
Michael, baby, I'm tellin' you, darlin'
Can't we fall in love?
Baby, can't we fall in love in again?
Let's hold on tight, don't turn out the light
Can't we fall in love again?
With all of my might, I wanna hold you real tight, baby
Can't we fall in love again?
Hold on tight, don't turn out the light
Can't we fall in love again?
Baby, with all of my might, you know I got to make things right
You can, you can
