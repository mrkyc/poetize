I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find a love within
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let it go
My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well I'm in a daze from your love, you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

Some people go around the world for love
But they may never find what they dream of

What you won't do, do for love
I've tried everything but you don't give up
In my world only you
Make me do for love what I would not do
Make me do for love what I would not do

You know I only want the best, it's true
They can't believe the things I do for you
In my world, in my world, only you
Ooh, make me do for love what I would not do, yeah
