Oh, wo, wo
I am not ashamed in any way
Of how I've my life
Held my head up high
Never once did I run and hide
Why should I compromise
I never live a lie
Take your time to understand me
If you want to share my life
Please don't think that I'm demanding
Its just the way I am
And now I need to know
How far we can go
CHORUS
I've been waiting so long 
Time for you to be strong 
Show respect for me 
Even more sincerity 
If you come to me unselfishly
I'll treat you like a king
I will hold you tight
Each and every night
Tenderness is all that I possess
I really must confess
You might also likeI would rather be here lonely
Than be mistreated by you
If you really want to know me
Just look into me eyes and make me realize
There's no need to hide
CHORUS
I've been waiting so long 
Time for you to be strong 
Show respect for me 
Even more sincerity 
Deep down in my heart
There's a very special place
That so few people ever get to see
So if you want to get close to me
All you got to do is show me some sincerity
Sh-show me
Show me baby
Show me
Aw come on and show it
I need to know baby
Come on baby
You need to be there for me
CHORUS
I've been waiting so long 
Time for you to be strong 
Show respect for me 
Even more sincerity 
CHORUS
I've been waiting so long 
Time for you to be strong 
Need to be strong
Show respect for me 
Yes indeed, take your time to understand me 
Even more sincerity 
CHORUS
I've been waiting so long 
Too long
Time for you to be strong 
Need you right there
Show respect for me
