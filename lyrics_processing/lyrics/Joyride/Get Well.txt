I'm tryna leave you behind, no
Yeah, ah yeah baby

I'm tryna leave you behind
I'm positive, I'm tryna be positive
But the world still bleeding in my eyes
I know you're sad but darling don't cry
I know you're dying but darling please stay alive

Chicken need the red rooster, burgers and all
Eating away that 1-800 call
So they eat til' they heart stop, no therapist can help, no long talks
Eating away on those McDonald's takeaways
They've tried everything there ain't another way
Desperate, running through options to get to better days
Helplessness, spreads from feelings to their blood in their veins
All cause problems clog em'
And drugs food can't hide em' all day
Soon they'll be filled, pop up in your face
Pills upon pills upon pills, hide it they pillow case
For the thrill? Nah, to slip away from the pain they feel
Thinking about all the time they killed
The time they wasted, 31 living in they mom's basement
Hours and hours turn to days upon days to weeks upon weeks
Now they living of meds and weed
You might also like
I'm tryna leave you behind
I'm positive, I'm tryna be positive
But the world still bleeding in my eyes
I know you're sad but darling don't cry
I know you're dying but darling please stay alive

Sipping bottles, sipping bottles, feel a little bit drunk
All this shit I've swallowed I don't know if it's legit or just junk
Fuck it, I'm just having fun
Fuck this world, I just wanna run away
Baby I'll sell drugs and you can get a real job
And I'll party every day
I feel so much pain
I feel the anger through my veins
But I don't wanna tell anybody I'm too afraid
Too afraid to worry cause' when I worry too much I wanna go away
Oh lord, take me away
Where all my money go? Oh shit it's all gone
But I need drugs and alcohol
And food, I need somewhere to sleep
Oh lord, please don't let me sleep on the streets
I promise I'll stop taking drugs and do good deeds
Christs sake, I got a family to feed
And that family is me
I'm trying to be better and I know it's far but I think I can reach
I'm tryna leave you behind
I'm positive, I'm tryna be positive
But the world still bleeding in my eyes
I know you're sad but darling don't cry
