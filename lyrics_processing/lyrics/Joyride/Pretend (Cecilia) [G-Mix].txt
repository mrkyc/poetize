Nothing tying her down, she a free spirit
Just riding around wherever she's feelin'
We were vibing out, letting the trees lift us
Can't pick it right now but she's different
And I'm in it, each hour and each minute
Though it's written that each flower indeed withers
But man, she got me so deep in it
I mean she mean with it, and me, I'm with it
Even if it only ever leads me to greed
Cause even when she's gone I feel her breathing with me
Man she gave it to me, that don't mean that it's free
Praying she looks past every reason to leave
You see, ever since I met her, can't seem to forget her
Even though it would probably be for the better
Probably free your head up
Get a grip, got to keep it together
You let her slip and she will hold you forever
Let me just drift away

So let me just drift away
I promise that I'll be all right
So let me just drift away
And if I see your face again we'll pretend that we're okay
You might also like
I see her up till dawn, she's looking for that first light
Painted mask on her face, hide the hurt pride
It's all a facade, but nothing is rehearsed right?
Do it come as a surprise, shoulda learned my now
You can't take that lying down
Add fuel to the fire and wonder why it ain't dying now
A hot bed that cross wires turn the dial round
Till we find out something to fight a flight about
C'mon tell the truth, do I pollute your thoughts?
Wide awake, wishing I could keep your doona warm
Inevitable, the revenge of the true adore
But if you recall, they threw it all
It was just more of the same
So I think it's time to call it a day
Nah, let me just drift away
All of a sudden I don't got a single thing to say

So let me just drift away
I promise that I'll be all right
So let me just drift away
And if I see your face again we'll pretend that we're okay
So let me just drift away
I promise that I'll be all right
So let me just drift away
And if I see your face again we'll pretend that we're okay
Just drift away
I promise that I'll be all right
So let me just drift away
And if I see your face again we'll pretend that we're okay
