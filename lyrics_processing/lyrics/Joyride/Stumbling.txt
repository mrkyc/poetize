Just, just, just
Go on and have another sip, and
Go on and have another spliff, and
Go apeshit when that bass hit
Joyride's back with some more One Day shit

I should take it slow
Another sip and I'll be on the floor
And I don't think that I'm any fun
'Cause I'm anyone's tonight
And then the dance floor calls
The music makes me feel ten-feet tall
With no concern for my fellow man
I don't give a damn tonight

I need someone to keep an eye on me
'Cause access comes too easily
If I'm stumblin', well
I could use some help
To keep me from fallin' on the ground
To stop me from gettin' too damn loud
If you catch me high
Please save me from myself
You might also like
We all need savin' sometimes
And I've got my hand up
So if you see me fallin' down
Won't you come and help me stand up
I'm out of control
And I'm losin' my soul tonight
But when I get home
I find no solace being all alone
Tomorrow night I'm back in the game
Hopin' it's the same as tonight

I need someone to keep an eye on me
'Cause access comes too easily
If I'm stumblin', well
I could use some help
To keep me from fallin' on the ground
To stop me from gettin' too damn loud
If you catch me high
Please save me from myself

I'm spinnin' around
We'll be fallin' down
My feet feel like they're
A million miles off the ground
I'm spinnin' around
We'll be fallin' down
But my feet feel like they're
A million miles off the ground
I need someone to keep an eye on me
'Cause access comes too easily
If I'm stumblin', well
I could use some help
To keep me from fallin' on the ground
Stop me from gettin' too damn loud
If you catch me high won't you
Won't you save me from myself?
Won't you save me, won't you save me from myself?
Won't you
