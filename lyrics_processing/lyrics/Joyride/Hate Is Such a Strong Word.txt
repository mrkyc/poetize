The in-between we're dancing in
Has turned the lights on, the music stopped long ago
The music stopped long ago
And the drugs that were enhancing it
Have all worn off now, the cracks all start to show
The cracks all start to show
For months now we've been chancing it
We saw this coming, but we could never know
No, we could never know
And the end's so unromantic, it
Should never've been like this, but that's just how it goes
And I told you from the start
That in a few months things would go sour

You say you
Hate me but we
Both know that's not
True
I hate myself
Much more for
Staying here with
You

So sayonara, baby
And I hope you feel better
About love and trust
And me eventually
So sayonara, baby
I know one day we'll feel better
And maybe we can work it out
We'll just wait and see
You might also like
Give me time to clear my head, babe
If you feel alone now, just know that things get worse
Know that things get worse
'Cause I'm the one who'll have to end it
And even though I might love ya my indecision is my curse
And I can see why that hurts
I'm very sorry

You say you
Hate me but we
Both know that's not
True
I hate myself
Much more for
Staying here with
You

So sayonara, baby
And I hope you feel better
About love and trust
And me eventually
So sayonara, baby
I know one day we'll feel better
And maybe we can work it out
We'll just wait and see
Goodbye's hardly ever forever
Going off how many times we've said it this year
And our minds keep changing like the weather
Whether we should let the other just disappear

Goodbye's hardly ever forever
Actin' like I'll never see your face again
Goodbye's hardly ever forever
Sure maybe we can pretend
Goodbye's hardly ever forever
And maybe we can make it work better as friends
Goodbye's hardly ever forever
But then we're fucking again, we're fucking again, we're fucking again

Goodbye's hardly ever forever
Going off how many times we've said it this year
And our minds keep changing like the weather
