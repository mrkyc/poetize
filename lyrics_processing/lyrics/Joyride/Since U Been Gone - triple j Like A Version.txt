Here's the thing, we started out friends
It was cool, but it was all pretend

Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah), since you been gone
Since you been gone

Dedicated, you took the time
It wasn't long until I called you mine

Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah), since you been gone
Since you been gone

And all you'd ever hear me say
Is how I pictured me with you
That's all you'd ever hear me say

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you (thanks to you), now I get (now I get)
Get what I want
Since you been gone
You might also like
How can I put it? You put me on
I even fell for that stupid love song

Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah), since you been gone
Since you been gone

How come I'd never hear you say
I just wanna be with you
I guess you never felt that way

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you (thanks to you), now I get (now I get)
Get what I want
Since you been gone

You had your chance, you blew it
Out of sight, out of mind
Shut your mouth, I just can't take it
Again and again and again
And again, yeah
But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you (thanks to you), now I get
Get what I want
Since you been gone
To breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you (thanks to you), now I get (now I get)
You should know now that I get
I get what I want
Since you been gone
Since you been gone
