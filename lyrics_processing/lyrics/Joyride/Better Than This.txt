My car won't start that day, so I'll meet you at the station
The bus is runnin' late, but I thank God that you're so patient
I catch a train to town, get something cheap to eat
'Cause I can barely afford the shoes down on my feet, but I'm singin'

Oh, thank God I've found a woman just like you
Just like you
And you'll be thankin' God you came across me too
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll talk about growin' old together
And when we sleep we'll never dream, 'cause nothing could be better
No, nothing could be better, better than this
Better than this
Better than this
Better than this

When we're done with lunch, yeah, we'll go and catch a movie
But leavin' halfway through 'cause you've gotta get to uni
Failin' all your classes and you can't miss anymore
But come seven PM I'll be knockin' on your door, and I'm singin'

Oh, thank God I've found a woman just like you
Just like you
And you'll be thankin' God you came across me too
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll talk about growin' old together
And when we sleep we'll never dream, 'cause nothing could be better
No, nothing could be better, better than this
Better than this
Better than this
Better than this

Maybe one day we could fly away
Maybe one day we could fly away
Just you and me, somewhere serine
Maybe one day we could fly away
Maybe one day we could fly away
Just you and me, somewhere serine
Maybe one day we could fly away
Maybe one day we could fly away
Just you and me, somewhere serine
Maybe one day we could fly away
Maybe one day, oh, oh, oh
But until that day I'll be standin' here and I'm, and I'm singin'

Oh, thank God I've found a woman just like you
Just like you
And you'll be thankin' God you came across me too
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll talk about growin' old together
And when we sleep we'll never dream, 'cause nothing could be better
No, nothing could be better, better than this
Better than this
Better than this
