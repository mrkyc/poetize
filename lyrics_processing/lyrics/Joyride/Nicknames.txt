So let me preface this story I'm 'bout to tell
 this girl is fine, man, she cute as hell
Her smell, and her body, and her facial features
Bring 'em together, she always leavin' me speechless
So much I can't say hi
Feelin' like Fatlip, she keep on passin' me by
And I try, so you can call me Talib
But why would she notice when every other brother callin' dibs
Shucks, I don't even know her name
And this is why I decided to start this little game
And it's a little insane, you pro'bly don't care
I got a couple nicknames I think I got to share, like
One night stand, she leavin' me sober
I call her Valerie, because she won't come over
She's so sweet I call her Creaming Soda
Put a spring in my step, I gotta call her October
Hot like January, but, brother, she scary
I gotta call her Mel B
But man, she healthy, so I'm callin' her Zumba
You know I'd call her up if I only had her number, like
"What's good? How you doin'? Where you been?"
I think I need to notify the game's next of kin
Because you're killin' it, and Bryan Ferry said love is the drug
So open up the bum bag, I heard your dealin' it
But I ain't feelin' it when I'm standin' there
With the wilted rose, others dudes step up tellin' you to touch your toes
And ditch the clothes
Like you were a felon,  girl, you know you are
Been in love since the day that I noticed her
Murderer, you had me pushin' up daisies
I still want you to have my babies
Plus I heard the pussy's bald, gotta call it M-Phazes
What?

Said, I don't even know your name
I really wanna get to know ya
I got this love that I need to show ya
 everythin' is all so lame
I just want you next to me
Girl, you're the best to me

Ayy
Look
Man, I saw her out
Last night, got home, couldn't sleep, call her Charlie
Thinkin' up nicknames like CeeLo, 'cause she gnarly
Or maybe Bob Marley, 'cause she goes so well with a joint
My ballerina, yeah, she so on point
But shit, I really need to stop obsessin', they're fish in the sea
And all those other love lessons handed down to me
Just so I could keep my head above water
While I'm tryna court your daughter, hopin' I don't disapoint her
Swear I only got eyes for her, she got legs for days
She could rule the Earth, I need to mend my ways
'Cause men might say, "You're out of your league"
But with her it's like I never even joined a team, you na'mean?
I gotta let her go
I'll never feel the same about another girl, man, but I can't let this grow
I need to break the chains
You know what they say, man, what's in a name?

Said, I don't even know your name
I really wanna get to know ya
I got this love that I need to show ya
 everythin' is all so lame
I just want you next to me
Girl, you're the best to me
