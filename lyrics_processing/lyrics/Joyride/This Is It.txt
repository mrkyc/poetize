Listen, listen

See every time you say that you want to go
I think I'll just delete your number from my phone
So I can feel all right
When I'm alone at night
And if you're comin' back, baby, I'm not scared
Just know that I want you up out of my hair
I'm done with you, you know we're through
So why do we still care?

And you say that it's okay, but
I don't know, man, I don't know
'Cause every time you try to 
All in the people in 
You will fall short, trick, you've been caught
By the leader of the pack
I'll just keep on gettin' mine
You just keep on gettin' back

You say you've got your reasons
I say they don't mean shit
We jumped into the deep end
Maybe this is it
You say you've got your reasons
I say they don't mean shit
So now I'm up and leavin'
Baby, this is it
You might also like
You're back for round two
Got me thinkin', 'What the fuck am I supposed to do?
Should I love her? Should I leave? Should I try and believer her
After all the stupid shit she put me through?'
And I'm sure that I made you feel the same way too
So I say that you think there's more to loose
We should learn from our mistakes
And hopefully we'll find a better path to choose

And you say that it's a phase, but
I don't know, man, I don't know
No notice 
 thrown into the fold
So you fell short, bitch, you been caught
By the leader of the pack
I'll just keep on gettin' mine
You just keep on gettin' back, yeah

You say you've got your reasons
I say they don't mean shit
We jumped into the deep end
Maybe this is it
You say you've got your reasons
I say they don't mean shit
So now I'm up and leavin'
