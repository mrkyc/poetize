When I was four I thought I was a girl
I had a doll and my hair would curl
My sister let me play with her
Her silly little toy brother
She and Leslie put me in a dress
We all laughed, I was a pretty mess
I learned later that this was wrong
Boys don't dress up if they're going to belong

And fair, is fair
Take a shot if you dare
No guy shies from a fight
On a Thornhill summer night
And a man, is a man
When he's got a gun in his hand
Well, I've never wanted to destroy
I always made a lousy boy

Sometimes you gotta live within your skin
Sometimes you gotta take a shot on the chin
13 and I didn't wanna get caught
They set the tussle for Mac's parking lot
You might also likeMe and some kid I was supposed to hate
Two gladiators coming out of grade eight
And every instinct telling me that I should lie
I swallowed hard and I swallowed my pride

And fair, is fair
Take a shot if you dare
No guy shies from a fight
On a Thornhill summer night
And a man, is a man
When he's got a gun in his hand
Well, I've never wanted to destroy
I always made a lousy boy

I sing these words and I remember that night
I'll grow some wrinkles but I think I'm alright
Sometimes I'm vulnerable, sometimes I cry
I won't join any tribe living a lie
And I know guys who are just like me
They like hockey and poetry
I think in retrospect that we have won
I'm a full-grown man and I don't own a gun
And fair, is fair
Take a shot if you care
Some guy shies from a fight
On a Thornhill summer night
If a man, is a man
When he's got a gun in his hand
Well, I've never learned to destroy
I always made a lousy boy
