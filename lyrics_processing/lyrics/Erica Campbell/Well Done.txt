All I want to see here
Look upon his face
That I seen forever
All this saving grace
On the streets of glory
Let me lift my voice
Cares all past, home at last
Ever to rejoice

I want to hear him say well done
One time, one time (one time, one time)
One time, one time (one time, one time)
Ooh, I just want to hear him say well done
One time, one time (one time, one time)
One time, one time (one time, one time)
All I want to do is hear you say it (one time)
Write my name in the book, call me (one time)
That's all I really need, just (one time)
I can't wait 'til I see ya (one time)
One one one one one one

You gave me my gift, go'n have it back
You fill me with love so I give it back to you
You gave me my husband, you know I love him
And I'll give him back so you know I'm all in
Lord take my children, my family
I want you to know that you have me

Wanna wake up in my heavenly home
All my people bow down to the king on the throne
Hold up, wait a minute
Gold streets, gold mansions
Just because I love god with a passion
Can't get you in the gates but if you're asking
He'll give you that life, can you imagine
Living with all his grace
Sometimes I still get amazed, yeah yeah yeah
Crazy for all of my days on
Until I finally stop breathing

Did I serve you right?
Did I live out loud?
Did I do it for you or did it I do it all just for the love of the crown?

But you gave me yours so I gotta give it back
Man it's only right
