I woke up in the mornin'
Poured myself some coffee
Cooked the kids some breakfast
Man, my life is hectic
But the only thing that I can seem to think about is You
People always askin', "What would Jesus do?"
I guess that everybody else is thinkin' 'bout You too
All around the world what they talk about is You

You are good
You're so strong
You're so smart
You're never wrong
You are, You are, You are, You are
You're so big
You're so tall
You're so high
You know it all
You are, You are, You are, You are

My schedules and my plans
The shows and the fans
Would probably drive me crazy if I didn't hold Your hand
'Cause no matter where I go I never ever, ever go without You (Woo)
I just couldn't do it, no, I wouldn't go through it (Through it)
Trying to rock without You's like an engine with no fluid (Fluid)
I'd crash and I'd burn and I'd die without, without You, yeah
