Didn't wanna write this not my type of song
Trying to recon style this still I found you gold
Seeing your vision through the tears that I cry
And i know it will be alright

Theres one thing about it
I know I will see you again
But my heart is hurting
Somethings I just dont understand
Trying my best to be who you taught me to be
So I'll keep going, said I gotta keep going

And it will be alright, it's gonna be alright
If we just keep on going, keep on holding on
It will be alright, it's gonna be alright
If I just keep on going,holding on
It will be alright, it's gonna be alright
If I just keep on going,holding on

We living this life just to live again live again
No one can tell me that this is the end
There will be times when you will have to cry
But wipe those tears from your eyes cause I believe I believe yeah

And it will be alright, it's gonna be alright
If we just keep on going, keep on holding on
It will be alright, it's gonna be alright
If I just keep on going,holding on
It will be alright, it's gonna be alright
If I just keep on going,holding on

All right All right Keep on going, holding on
All right All right Keep on going, holding on
All right All right Keep on going , holding on

It will be all right

If I just keep on going, holding on
It will be alright, it's gonna be alright
If I just keep on going, keep on holding on
