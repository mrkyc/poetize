This is the right time to believe in love

Everyone knows if you don't demand, it shows
That you understand the light shining inside us
It's more than tonight, it's forevermore, it's right
When there's someone there 'til the light, to hold you close

Mmm, you know it's all you will ever need
'Cause you're seein' love, and seein' it clearly
There's no doubt about it, you just have to shout out

This is the right time
This is the right time
(I can see it in your eyes)
This is the right time to believe in love

Everyone knows it's a special thing, it's a love
That will never, ever be wrong
'Cause this love is strong

Ooh, you know it's all you will ever need
'Cause you're seein' love, and seein' it clearly
There's no doubt about it, you just have to shout out
You might also like
This is the right time (Ooh)
This is the right time
(I can see it in your eyes)
This is the right time to believe in love
(Ooh-ooh)
This is the right time (Oh, oh)
This is the right time
(I can see it in your eyes)
This is the right time to believe in love
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

So when you know that there's someone there you want
And you want them so tonight
More than you've ever done anyone

You know it's all you will ever need
'Cause you're seein' love, and seein' it clearly
There's no doubt about it, you just have to shout out

This is the right time
This is the right time
(I can see it in your eyes)
This is the right time to believe in love
This is the right time
This is the right time
(And I can see it in your eyes)
This is the right time to believe in love
Well, do you believe, baby?
'Cause I believe, baby
Do you believe, baby?
Believe in love
This is the right time
This is the right time
This is the right time to believe in love
This is the right time
