Kick off my shoes and wait on you
Well it's way past dawn and your still gone
Where in the world is my boo?
See I was fallin' asleep and you were creeping in
I never would have noticed until when
Until I smelt perfume, the kind I do not wear
My baby's been messin' around again
You shouldn't have done me babe
Now watch what I do to you
Baby I'm leavin' I'm leavin' I'm leavin'
Leavin' you
You shouldn't have done me babe
Now watch what I do to you
Baby I'm leavin' I'm leavin' I'm leavin'
Leavin' you
How could I be so dumb? I thought I loved a man
But more and more you proved to be a boy
And now I understand
But I can't baby sit no more, it's not what I loved you for
I'd rather be alone bye-bye cos' I'm really leavin' this time
You shouldn't have done me babe
Now watch what I do to you
Baby I'm leavin' I'm leavin' I'm leavin'
Leavin' you
You shouldn't have done me babe
Now watch what I do to you
Baby I'm leavin' I'm leavin' I'm leavin'
Leavin' you
You might also likeLook at you now begging down on your knees
Thinking I'm coming back, Oh child please
I said I was leavin' I mean whet I say
There's no turning around I'm Ieavin' today
You shouldn't have done me babe
Now watch what I do to you
Baby I'm leavin' I'm leavin' I'm leavin'
Leavin' you
You shouldn't have done me babe
Now watch what I do to you
Baby I'm leavin' I'm leavin' I'm leavin'
Leavin' you
No I can't baby sit no more, it's not what I loved you for
I'd rather be alone bye-bye cos' I'm really leavin' this time
You shouldn't have done me babe
Now watch what I do to you
Baby I'm leavin' I'm leavin' I'm leavin'
Leavin' you
You shouldn't have done me babe
Now watch what I do to you
Baby I'm leavin' I'm leavin' I'm leavin'
