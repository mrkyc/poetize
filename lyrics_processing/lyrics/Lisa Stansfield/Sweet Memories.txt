Send me reeling into ecstasy
Sweet memories of the love you gave me
Send me crying to my room
And I don't wanna miss you
But I do
No I don't wanna miss you
But I do
The weather changes
Like life changes
Like me and you have changed
It's all about nothing to talk about
Then you're washed up in the rain
I wonder why
I let love die
Just let you slip away
I cry and cry myself to sleep at night
Mm baby baby
I'm never gonna hear the last
About how stupid I was
I'm never gonna rest until I have you
Back in my arms
Sweet memories of the love you gave me
Send me reeling into ecstasy
Sweet memories of the love you gave me
Send me crying to my room
And I don't wanna miss you
But I do
No I don't wanna miss you
But I do
You might also likeI've tried to smile
I can't 'cos I'm
Feeling sorry for myself
And I can't hide
What I feel inside
And babe it hurts like hell
I'm never gonna hear the last
About how stupid I was
I'm never gonna rest until I have you
Back in my arms
Sweet memories of the love you gave me
Send me reeling into ecstasy
Sweet memories of the love you gave me
Send me crying to my room
And I don't wanna miss you
But I do
No I don't wanna miss you
But I do
No space or time could take me away from you
Not ever no no no not never
Ain't nothin' or no-one can split us in two
Not ever not never no no
Sweet memories of the love you gave me
Sweet memories of the love you gave me
And I don't wanna miss you
But I do
No I don't wanna miss you
