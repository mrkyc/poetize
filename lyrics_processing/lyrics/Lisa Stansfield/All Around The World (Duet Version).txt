I don't know where my baby is
But I'll find him (I'm sure you will)
Somewhere, somehow
(I'm sure you will; keep looking, Lisa)
And you know, Barry, I'll never give up looking for my baby
(Don't) Mmm, mmm, mmm (Don't ever)

Ooh, I've been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
(Sing it to 'em, baby)
But I'm gonna find him
(Someday, some way)

Oh, we had a quarrel and I let myself go
I said so many things, things he didn't know
And I was oh, oh, so bad
And I don't think he's coming back, mhm
He gave the reasons, the reasons he should go
He said things he hadn't said before
And he was oh, oh so mad (So mad, pretty mad?)
And I don't think he's coming back, coming back
I did too much lying (Well), I wasted too much time
Now I'm here and crying, I, I, I

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby (Sing it, Lisa)
But I'm gonna find him
(I know you are, baby; I know you are, Lisa)

Ooh-hoo, hoo-ooh
You've been a bad girl
You're gonna help me
You've been a bad girl
Hahahaha (You've been a bad girl, Lisa)
Mhm-hmm
What else?

So open-hearted, he never did me wrong (Honesty)
I was the one, the weakest one of all
And now I'm oh, oh, so sad
(I know what you mean, I know what you mean)
And I don't think he's coming back, coming back
I did too much lying (Too much lying), wasted too much time
(Time)
Now I'm here and crying (Crying), I, I, I

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him
(I know you will, baby, keep searching)
Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him

Ooh, I'm going to find him
I'm going to find him
Ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Maybe someday)
Maybe someday (Baby)
I did too much lying, wasted too much time
(You're crying?)
Now I'm here and crying, I, I, I

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him (Someday, some way)

I've been around the world, looking for my baby
Been around the world, and I'm gonna, I'm gonna find him
(Tell him, tell him, tell him)

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away (Why she's gone away)
And I don't know where he can be, my baby (Woo)
But I'm gonna find him
