Gonna give you all of me, as much as you can stand
Make love to you right now, that's all I want to do
I know you need it, boy, and you know I need it, too

'Cause I've found what the world is searchin' for
Here, right here, my dear, I don't have to look no more
And all of my days, I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you to make me feel the way you do

Never, never gonna give you up
I'm never ever gonna stop
Not the way I feel about you
Babe, I just can't live without you
I'm never ever gonna quit, no
'Cause quiting just ain't my schtick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
And do all the things you want me to

You've given me much more than words could ever say
And oh my dear I'II be right here until my dying day
I don't know just how to say all the things I feel
I just know that I love you so and it gives me such a thrill

'Cause I've found what the world's been lookin' for
Here, ooh, right here my dear, I don't have to search no more
And all of my days, I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you to make me feel the way you do
