I've been waiting for this day
Just look me in the eye and know that I want it this way
Got a feeling of anticipation burning inside of me
And I never felt so alive
I'm shaking inside
And it makes me wanna, makes me wanna
Fall dawn on my knees and say
Let it always be this way
Got a feeling taking over me
Gotta shout out, let go, right now, God knows
I'm ready, yes I'm ready to lay it on the line
So take my heart
Take my breath away
Hold me tight
Like we only have today
Suddenly awake
It's almost like I could be naked in front of you
Drowning in emotion
Every second every moment with you
I can only try
To tell it like it is
And if I said it twice
Its cos I can't deny that I'm
Overcome by my passion I feel my blood racing inside of me
My heart beats so fast 1 could fly, I'm aching inside
You make me wanna, make me wanna
You might also likeFall down on my knees and say
Let it always be this way
Got a feeling taking over me
Gotta shout out, let go, right now, God knows
I'm ready, yes I'm ready to lay it on the line
So take my heart
Take my breath away
Hold me tight
Like we only have today
Suddenly awake
It's almost like I could be naked in front of you
Drowning in emotion
Every second every moment with you
Go on, go on take it, baby
Go on, take it, baby
Go on, take, take it, take, take
So take my heart
Take my breath away
Hold me tight
Like we only have today
Suddenly awake
It's almost like I could be naked in front of you
Drowning in emotion
