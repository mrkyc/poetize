Yesterday when you said good-bye
Thought I'd spend my whole life just crying
Hurting inside
Oh but you know that...
I decided to pull my heart together
And chase your face from my mind
From this day on all the hurt is gone
I'll be fine
I cried my last tear last night baby
And I'm not gonna cry
Never never gonna cry
I'm not gonna cry no more
I cried my last tear last night baby
And one thing it true
Won't be crying over you
Never again
I remember the pain you caused me
I remember the nights I cried
Now I'm gonna forget you baby
Push you right out of my mind
Oh don't you know that...
You might also likeI decided to find same better weather
And chase that rain right out of my sky
I'm all through being sad and blue
Tell you why...
I cried my last tear last night baby
And I'm not gonna cry
Never never gonna cry
I'm not gonna cry no more
I cried my last tear last night baby
And one thing it true
Won't be crying over you
Never again
If you think I'll be broken hearted
Think it's time that you think again
'Cos this time I won't sit here waiting
Waiting here for the tears to end
Baby I refuse to be blue one more minute over you
And one thing is true
Won't be crying over you
I cried my last tear last night baby
And I'm not gonna cry
Never never gonna cry
I'm not gonna cry no more
I cried my last tear last night baby
And one thing it true
Won't be crying over you
Never again
If you think I'll be broken hearted
Think it's time that you think again
'Cos this time I won't sit here waiting
Waiting here for the tear, to end
Baby I refuse to be blue one more minute over you
And one thing is true
Won't be crying over you
I cried my last tear last night baby
And I'm not gonna cry
Never never gonna cry
I'm not gonna cry no more
I cried my last tear last night baby
And one thing it true
Won't be crying over you
