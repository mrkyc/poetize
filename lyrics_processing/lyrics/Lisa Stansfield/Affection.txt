Feel the sun on your face and the wind in you hair
And a big, big love in your heart so strong
Feel a hand in your hand and a whisper sweet and low
That says "I love you"

We all know what we want

Affection, it's a way of life
Direction, all of us know which way we're going
Mmm, with our affection
Affection, may be big or small but know we that
We can have it all with our affection
We know which way to go
Ooh-ooh-ooh, hey

Take a walk in the sun with the one you love
And a big, big love in your heart so strong, mmm
And rest a little while, keep on smilin', smilin'

And we all know what we want
You might also like
Affection, it's a way of life
Direction, all of us know which way we're going
Mmm, with our affection, ooh-ooh-ooh
Affection, may be big or small but know we that
We can have it all with our affection
'Cause we know which way to go


Well, you could lay down and die for the one you're lovin'
There's a sweet, sweet love in your heart so strong
When you're dancin' on the air like you don't care
It's honey on your lips and it's sweeter to your fingertips
You know what we want

Affection, it's a way of life
Direction, all of us know which way we're going
Mmm, with our affection, oh, oh, oh
Affection, may be big or small but know we that
We can have it all with our affection
We know which way to go

Affection
Oh, direction
Ooh, with our affection
Listen, I want more affection
Slow, oh baby (We know that)
Slow, oh baby, mhm, mmm
Ooh (We know which way to go)
We know, we know
Oh, oh, affection
