She love me when I'm making her sweat
I love her but only when she wet
She tells me keep her cummin' all night, keep her cummin' all night
She already knowing I got that pipe
She calls me, "bae lets get it in"
I come through, sex soon as I walk in
I tells her bring it back all night, bring it back all night
I'm already knowing she gone do me right

I be makin' her strip
She be riding the shit out my dick
I be taking her on trips, embracin' her hips
Having her feelin' like she the shit
Yessuh, I be grippin' that ass
It be feelin' like cash
Never do we go fast, we can let time past
But we gone make this shit last
You might also likeShe be ready for pain, and I be ready for brain
Look, she be yellin' my name
Tellin' me, "spenz keep doing yo thang. don't nobody do it the same"
And I just knod and say "I know"
Now fuck me good before I go
And walk my ass up out that door
I tell her what to do
She never says no
She tells me to stop, but really means go
She carry herself so professional
But in the bed she's a ho

She love me whenever I'm making her sweat
I love her but only when she wet
She tells me keep her cummin' all night, keep her cummin' all night
She already knowing I got that pipe
She calls me, "bae lets get it in"
I come through, sex soon as I walk in
I tells her bring it back all night, bring it back all night
I'm already knowing she gone do me right

My black snake be making her moan
We be fucking off of this song
I don't ever leave her on
I just tell her leave her thong
We be going all day long
Everything feels right
When we turnin' off lights
Our sex has no price
I wouldn't trade it in for nothing, baby never in my life
She be ready for it all
I be ready to see a round of applause
She naked, no panties no bra
Ah, fucked her better than all my other broads
And she just knod and say "I know"
I fuck her good before she go
And get her ass up and put on her clothes
She ask me for mo', I can't tell her no
Why she steady tellin' me that she gotta go
She asks me for cash as she walks to the door
I stale face her ass, she already know (I don't spend on hoes)

She love me whenever I'm making her sweat
I love her but only when she wet
She tells me keep her cummin' all night, keep her cummin' all night
She already knowing I got that pipe
She calls me, "bae lets get it in"
I come through, sex soon as I walk in
I tells her bring it back all night, bring it back all night
