I'm livin' large as possible, posse unstoppable
Style topical, it's vividly optical
Listen, you'll see 'em, sometimes I'll be 'em
Cops, critics and punks, never ever want to see me in power
Well, that's too bad
Apocalypse Now, I'm back and I'm mad
We're comin', you're runnin' cold and cunnin'
Ice T on the mic, Top Gunnin'
After your neck, checkin' respect, makin' you sweat
Rhyme Syndicate, boy, in effect
The rap motivator, teacher, talker, night rhyme stalker
We're thrillin', so real they're chillin', the hit author
Gettin' louder than a shotgun, you don't want none
Rhyme Pays was the name of the album
But that was number one, this is number two
The posse grew, we're gonna break through

Power

Somebody line up the suckers who refuse to recognize the truth
Tie up the punks who refuse to understand the youth
My posse's growin' and it's gettin' larger every day
Detroit, Chi-Town, Pittsburgh, Houston, L.A
Come on, come on, come on, toys, let's play
Circle the calendar, perpetrate a doomsday
Ice-T, fool, man of my own full-grown
I cause havoc when I speak upon the microphone
I'm outspoken, no jokin'
Get in my face, your jaw will get broken
Layin' it, sayin' it, then you're playing it
Lyrics so heavy that you might try weighin' it
Hated by many but I hate 'em back
Loved by troopers who know where it's at
You might like me, might think I'm wack
But don't step to me 'cause the boy stays strapped
I'm taking no shorts, hatin' the courts, I'm hatin' the judges
Punk DA's with their personal grudges
I hate the clubs that think with their butts
No hats, jeans, sneakers, no what?
No beepers, no gold? Yo, kiss my ass
We'll wait and see who gets the last laugh
We'll have the power
You might also like
Power
We'll have the power
Power

Power, it starts with P like pussy
She knows she got it, she doesn't worry, does she?
Spendin' your cash, leavin' you in the trash
While your little head's thinkin', they're gone in a dash
They got it, know it, that's why they show it
The power of sex, if man could overthrow it
He'd be king in a day, no way
We get rich, hard, give it away
We're weak and as we speak, the girls are hawkin'
Sizin' me up straight out as I'm talkin'
You gotta have control if you want the gold
I don't wanna be alone like Stallone
So I keep my mind thinkin' 'bout the green
And stop dwellin' on the in-between, I got power

Power

I'm on a mission mackin' hard as a hammer
You take my picture, I might take your camera
My posse might move, and they move fast
A fool's move could be a punk's last
Ain't no criminal although I used to be
Ain't no new jack, rappin' ain't new to me
I been makin' records on wax since 1982
Now it's 1988, finally I'm coming through
That adds up to six years of makin' okay jams, but now I'm mad
Here comes the body slam
Turnin' out concerts, housin' the industry
Lovin' all the fly girls screamin' for Ice-T
Rollin' with the Syndicate, my unstoppable battalion
38 solid gold my medallion
Gainin' velocity, momentum and energy
Ice Capital T, boy, I got the power
Power

So you say that I'm a fake, think, you really must be a fool
I been in jail more times than you have probably been in school
Shot at, shot back, hit, seen my buddies killed
That's the foundation upon the raps of Ice-T are built
I say what I think, the system does stink
Money you walk, you short, you're writin' from the clink
Come on, what's up? You know the laws are full of bull
Prey on the lame, release those with pull
Power, I know you wanna try it
Well, check it out, money can buy it
Control and mold the world to do your wishin'
The knowledge of power is mine, so just listen
Money controls the world and that's it
And once you got it, then you can talk shit, power

You'll have the power
Power
You'll have the power
