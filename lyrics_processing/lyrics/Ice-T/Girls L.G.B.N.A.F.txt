Man, this tune is funkier than nineteen yards of chitlins with onions and sardines on the side
Now that's funky

One, two, one, two, two, three
I'm the emcee called Ice-T (Uh-huh)
That's DJ Evil E (Word)
Islam creates the beats (Dope beats)
You girls look so sexy (Uh-huh)
I wish you all were up here with me (You know that)
You drive me crazy with them big ol' butts (Uh)
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck tonight

I'm tryna make this real clear, dear (Tell 'em, Ice)
I've no time to whisper in your ear (No time for that)
No time to remove your fears
I just wanna get near (Near, close, know what I'm sayin'?)
Get butt naked and roll around (Aw shit)
Move our bodies like up and down (Aw yeah)
Do that stuff that your mama call smut
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck, come on

You know you wanna do it too (Yes you do)
It's good to me and it's good to you (You know it's good)
I only speak what's true (Word)
You say you don't, but I know you do (You know you do)
Come on up to my room (Come on)
We'll undress by the light of the moon (Uh)
Lay down and I'll caress that butt
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck
You might also like
I mean real stupid and nasty (Nasty)
I know what you want, so you don't have to ask me (Uh)
Just lay back and I'll operate
Jimbrowski will go to work and penetrate (Jimbrowski)
And then we'll both feel great (Good, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Make your move tonight, girl, don't hesitate
We both want it, don't make it tough
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck

Homeboys, you know the situation (Yo, y'all know that)
You're trying to rap but they give you frustration (Mhm)
Nose in the air, turning you down
When you really wanna say, "Yo, baby, let's get down"
But you don't, you keep frontin' (You keep frontin')
Kickin' conversation, ain't talkin' 'bout nothin' (Nothin')
When all that's really on your mind is what?
"Yo, baby, let's get butt naked and fuck"

That's right, if you're a man you want it (You know that)
If you're a woman, you tease him and flaunt it (Aw yeah)
But my crew got to have it (Gotta have it)
And after they dog it, I autograph it (Uh)
The Syndicate don't lecture (No lecture)
We move in a group, seduce and capture
And if the posse has good luck
The girls will get butt naked and fuck that night (Aw yeah)
Islam takes the pictures (Yo Is')
And girls, I'ma say Evil E's gonna get ya (I'ma get ya)
Get ya illin' in a nude mode
A double X-rated episode (Uh)
Hotel rooms cold explode
When my posse unloads
Sex in effect when we're on the road
Brush it

Put your hands up in the air (In the air)
If you love sex, I know you're out there (Word)
Safe sex, that is (Aw yeah)
Ya got to be careful with this '88 sex biz (Uh-huh)
But that's another song (Sex)
Girls, move your bodies sexy and the brothers will come along
Homeboys, move in on that butt and say
