Yo, Ice, a reporter wants to get an interview with you, guys from Billboard magazine
No, no, no, zero
Yo, Ice, it's a girl
Word
Hello, Ice, after the success of your first album, our readers wanna know just one thing: how you living?

My lifestyle's crazy, I'm luxury lazy
So much gold that jewelry don't faze me
Cordless phone, eight or nine homes
Girlies on my Jammie with an Ice-T jones
Bank account boomin', fast-lane zoomin'
Known around the world for my high post groomin'
Mack like a preacher, love like a teacher
Got a girl who lives in Paris
When I want her I beep her
Too many clothes, got a ragtop Rolls
1,000 Watt system and my speakers are Bose
I kick it like a champ, I thought you knew it
Pimpin' ain't easy but somebody gotta do it
Yo Ice, they want you to be on Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous
Man, hang up on that fool
Yo, Ice, what you doing with the fur coat on the floor?
Homeboy, that's the carpet, man
Yo, man, what we doing with all this money all over the floor?
Man, get the vacuum
Yo, man, there's ten girls waiting in the bedroom
Leave 'em there for a week, another day

My thumbs are tired just from countin' cash
No more room in my diamond stash
Filin' my nails is such a tirin' task
Gold knobs on my Benzo dash
Five freaks just to comb my hair
Monograms on my underwear
Bodyguards around so please don't dare
You're takin' a chance if you just stop and stare
Livin' my life is just so hard to do
Makin' deals a million one or two
Buyin' new cars for my entire crew
Matching Ferraris, E's black, mine's blue
Can't swim a lap in my pool because it's just too long
Could never go broke because my bank's too strong
No matter what I do I simply can't go wrong
And I'll make money I don't need from this damn song
But somebody's gotta do it
You want this rope for ten thousand-one-twenty?
Yo, I'll put it on the dog, man
Yo, Ice, what you gonna do, you got a house on Palm Springs half-built
Man, I don't like it no more, tear it down, I don't need anymore
Yo, Ice, Gucci, Lee and Fila wanna sponsor you
Man, I told you I don't need it no more, damn
When I walk in a joint, punks always look at me hard
Because I wear enough gold to tie a dog in a yard
Cold maxin' in my mansion so big it's silly
Got a butler named Humphry and a maid named Milly
Mink sheets on my bed, that's what I said
Gourmet chefs in my kitchen so that I can get fed
So tired of sailin' on my boat I might
Just helicopter to my jet and catch a midnight flight
So many girls in my book, it weighs a ton
Gotta leave the damn country just to have some fun
Private suite at the track to watch the ponies run
And there ain't nothin' in the world that me and "E" ain't done
But somedody gotta do it
Yo, Ice, Ronald Reagan, man, he wans to know, can he hang out with you and E?
Yo, you tell that fool to get off my tip and pay!
Yo, yo, yo, Ice, your homeboy  he called up to borrow some more money
