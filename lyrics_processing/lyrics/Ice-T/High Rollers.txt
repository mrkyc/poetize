Speed of life, fast
It's like walking barefoot over broken glass
It's like jumping rope on a razor blade
All lightning quick, decisions are made
Lifestyle plush
Females rush
This high profile personality
Who earns his pay illegally
Professional liar
Schoolboys admire
Young girls desire
Very few live to retire
Cash flow extreme
Dress code supreme
Vocabulary obscene
Definition street player, you know who I mean, the high rollers

Yeah, the high rollers
Street hustlers
Fast money, fast life
But you don't care
'Til you end up with a bullet in your head, boy

People of the city, stop fooling yourself
Crime rules the streets, who the hell else?
All the police have gone out to play
'Cause for enough cold cash they'll look the other way
Look at the cars as they roll by
Benzes, Ferraris, trucks up high
Beepers connecting players to big-time deals
With all of this technology who needs to steal?
Just live a life of leisure every night and day
And you're living proof that crime does pay
Your life is dangerous and reckless
You eat fly guys and girls for breakfast
You're a titan of the nuclear age
Your muscles flex with a Uzi or 12 gauge, and ya
Love the game, that's why ya boast 'cause ya
High priced, high speed, high post, high rollin'
You might also like
That's right, you're high rollin'
You think you got it goin on, right?
You got money, cars, jewelry
You think you got everything
Let me tell you, you ain't got nothin'
You ain't got nothin' but a one way ticket to death row
You gotta get outta the game, man
Or the game is gonna get you

Now when I say high rollers, I mean the best
Forget the half-steppers, eject the rest
'Cause these high ranked officials of our city streets
Make millions all triggered by electric beeps
They dress in diamonds and rope chains
They got the blood of Scarface runnin' through their veins
Silk shirts, leather suits
Hair always fresh, eel-skin boots
Large hearts, though the sizes vary
Bankrolls that take two pockets to carry
Cruising in their 500 Benz Sedan
With their systems peaked out rockin' Pusherman
Yes, their fashion's high, but hard to beat
They buy their Gucci at Gucci's, not the swap meet, eat
Very well, much clientele
Whatever you need, they probably sell, the high rollers
Yeah, and let me break down for the ladies
All you girls out there that think you gon' get that quick money and ain't goin' to jail
You better think again

Oh yes, I'm here to tell you females also roll
Drive the same cars, sometimes wear more gold
Cold as an igloo or hot as a flame
They'll shake ya, break ya and you won't know their name
Gangsters to the max, all marks will be taxed
These girls drive Ferraris, not Cadillacs
Respect is demanded, most men don't understand it
'Til they peep the huge bank that these girls have landed, they're
Junkies for fun, love life on the run
If things get hot, they will pull a gun
Prey on the lame, no shame to the game
They all seek power, **** the fame, the high rollers

Yeah, the high rollers
Street hustlers, the players
Out there gettin' that long money, you know what I'm sayin'?
But that fast money leads to a fast life and a quick death
This is my word, this is Ice-T
And I ain't got no reason to lie to you
Now radio stations probably won't play
This record because of the things I say
They'll say I'm glamorizing the hustling hood
And a record like this can do no good
But I'm not here to tell ya right or wrong
I don't know which side of the law you belong
Yes, the game has flash, but sometimes hurts
Behind any mistake, hard time lurks
And jail's not your only problem though it may seem
You just may die by a barrage from an M-16
But to each his own, choose your mobile phone
Choose a tailored suit, the luxury home
You'll never get caught 'cause you got nerves of ice
And you're much smarter than the crooks on Miami Vice
Right?

You wanna be a high roller
You wanna be a high roller
Yo, Ice, they just shot up some brothers over there on Crenshaw
Aw man, you know who they were?
Nah, they had bad cars, a whole bunch of gold and beepers on
