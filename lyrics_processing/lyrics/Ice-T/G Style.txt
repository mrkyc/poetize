Yeah! Right about now motherfuckers is layin for a nigga like me Ice-T
To bust some freestyle shit... but I don't do that
I just cold lounge up here at the Ammo Dump
With my nigga Aladdin, SLJ, LP and my nigga Henry G
Yeah, we do the shit like this

The card after the ace is deuce
So cut the nigga loose next on the 3
That's me, the motherfuckin T
I got juice, I ride on my surfboard
Rhyme hard
But only buy the shit that I can't afford
That's everything, that's why I truck big fat rings
Cause in the motherland gold is for kings
I got backup, to jack up
Punks who try to act up
Do a world tour, watch the big bank stack up
Muthafuckas get dropped with the quickness
Dig this, I got an ill left and a right fist
Make mistakes and you'll lose or you might die
Cause I'm the wrong Ice for your bruise and that's no lie
Meanwhile the penile is stacked to the top with my niggas
Mostly for squeezin triggas
I call em homies, pigs call em crooks
So I write kites and put bucks on they books
I give a fuck about a cop or a G-man
They all talk shit, their breath smellin like semen
I catch em in the alley all alone
Put em in the prone
Pop! Pop! Pop! To the dome

It's the G-style
Gangsta style

G Style, the gangsta talk on the full flex
I got a teflon .9 and it eats vests
I take a motherfucker out quick just for poppin' shit
Ride Rolls, catch hoes like a mitt
LA, Atlanta, New York yo my shit rocks
Chi-town, Miami, Detroit I get much props
Because I roll with the hardcore G
Every street's the same street to me
I don't bullshit, I don't quit, write in a rhyme fit
KKK pray each day that I get hit
Motherfuckers try to flip on the Icepick
Move and slip, close the eyes and catch a fuckin clip
Not in the ghetto no more but I do hang
Got a black phone and it's sittin on them thangs
I kick the game from the street not the slammer
Tighten up my knockas with a big lead hammer


Some of the times I write my raps with extreme speed
Some of the times I take the pen and make pads bleed
My mind clicks to Homicide
Bullets fly, ladies cry, a lot of people die
Some nights I can't write
Stare at the blue lines, I think I'm-a go blind
Then the beat becomes me
Sit in the dark and write a whole fuckin' LP
G Style, the gangsta talk never near soft
Hard as a knockout bout it's no sellout
I keep crime in my rhyme cause it's my thing
Packed with guns and drugs and lots of street slang
A-B-C-D-E-F, and LAPD
Words from a motherfuckin OG
Ammo Dump pumps the sounds that you bump in your trunk
So turn it up, punk!
What'cha fraid of? What'cha made of?
Pull the pin, set the grenade off
Blastin sounds out ya jeep on every city street, nigga
Straight gangsta beat


Many like to dress the style, and act hardcore
Many motherfuckers are and they crack jaws
I like to lay in the cut in a nightclub
Don't smoke bud, drink suds but I gets loved
Mack, cool I scope the freak with the mad backs
Hit her with the gangsta style, cool, relaxed, bam
Put her in the Benz, bump Too $hort, let her know
Right off the top what's my sport
You think long, you think wrong
You got it goin on, baby doll
But I won't sing you no love song
You either love me or you don't
You're either rollin tonight or you won't
She likes the style cause it don't bullshit around
Tongue in my ear, real slow and then it went down
I gotta flip into a ill mode
Pack a clip full of hype tracks and then unload
Music for the hardcore beatdown
No weak pop shit, strictly underground
And if you don't like the style as I get wreck
Ease back nigga, catch a knife through the neck
