Whenever I consider just where God brought me from
The life of emptiness I lived without God's son
My heart cries "hallelujah" cause the savior rescued me
Without his precious love where would I be?

I would be lost
I would be drifting like a ship on stormy seas
Without the sacrifice that Jesus life affords
I would be dead within my sin
Forever longing to be free
If it had not been for the goodness of the Lord
If it had not been for the goodness of the Lord

Since the day he saved me, just look where I've come from
I'm now being made into the likeness of God's Son
I have this blessed assurance, cause the savior rescued me
Without his precious love where would I be?

I would be lost
I would be drifting like a ship on stormy seas
Without the sacrifice that Jesus life affords
I would be dead within my sin
Forever longing to be free
If it had not been for the goodness of the Lord
If it had not been for the goodness of the Lord

Jesus brought me out of darkness, into his marvelous light
And placed me on a solid rock to stay
I'm now walking with my savior and I'm fighting the "good fight"
Because of Jesus I can truly say...

I would be lost
I would be drifting like a ship on stormy seas
Without the sacrifice that Jesus life affords
I would be dead within my sin
Forever longing to be free
If it had not been for the goodness of the Lord
If it had not been for the goodness of the Lord
The goodness of the Lord
The goodness of the Lord
The goodness of the Lord
He saved me, he raised me, he kept me
If it had not been for the goodness of the Lord
He saved me, he raised me, he kept me
If it had not been for the goodness of
The Lord, The Lord, The Lord, The Lord
