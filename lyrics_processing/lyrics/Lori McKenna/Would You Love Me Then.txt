I know I can
When you say you need more time
And you think that I'll under stand
Well you can put your finger to your nose
You can tell me just where I should go
Then you can fly
And I'll wonder why
What if I could leap tall buildings in a
In a single bound?
What if I could tell the world I loved you
Without even making a sound?
What if I was smarter than Einstein's daughter?
What if I had x-ray eyes?
What if I could run to the top of the sun
And not even look like I tried?
Would you love me then?
Things are never easy
Nothing's ever clear cut
Just when I thought you wanted more
You tell me that you've had enough
Well I know I'm not beautiful
And I'll never be tall and thin
But these things mean so much
When you feel with your eyes and not within
You might also likeWhat if I could leap tall buildings in a
In a single bound?
What if I could walk a cross the country
With out even touching the ground?
What if I was sorry for your sins?
What if I was Prince Charles's next of kin?
What if could change the world for you
I could make you love me if I wanted to
Would you love me then?
Would you love me then?
Would you love me then?
What if I could leap tall buildings in a
In a single bound?
What if I could tell the world I loved you
Without even making a sound?
What if I was smarter than Einstein's daughter?
What if I had x-ray eyes?
What if I could run to the top of the sun
And not even look like I tried?
