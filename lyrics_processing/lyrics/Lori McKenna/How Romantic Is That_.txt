The honeymoon lasted 24 hours
And was a town away
Then it was you and me
In that little apartment
Eight months before the baby came
Well, some people's blessings come in disguise
Oh, but yours and mine came
With curly hair and blue eyes
One looks like your mother and one like my dad
We can't give them everything
But we're not doin' so bad
You still want me
You still love me
You still lie there every night beside me
Every time you walk away from me
You come running back
How romantic is that
How romantic is that
Well, I might meet you at the door
With someone's math homework
Or you'll work a double shift
So we can get some bills paid
When you get home tonight
There'll be someone else sleeping there beside me
With "You Are My Sunshine" in a sweet serenade
You might also likeYou still want me
You still love me
You still lie there every night beside me
Every time you walk away from me
You come running back
How romantic is that
How romantic is that
You left a Hallmark card that morning on my bureau
You didn't know what to write
So you just signed your name
And that boy that I loved may not have been my hero
But the same is not true
Of the man he became
Well, forget about Paris or even Niagara Falls
We're lucky to steal a few hours
Alone when we can
But I won't regret, I won't regret anything at all
If the only world we see is
Outside the windows of our minivan
Cause I still want you
I still love you
I still lie there every night beside you
Every time I walk away from you
I come running back
How romantic is that
How romantic is that
How romantic
You still want me
You still love me
You still lie there every night beside me
You still want me
You still love me
You still lie there every night, every night, every night
