You ain't even thinkin' whatcha say
Your words leave me frozen like a lake
And trapped under the surface
You're killing off the one thing that gives us purpose
Stop
Take a look at love you'll never know
'Cause I'm not gonna let you leave me feelin' cold
So don't you come near
There'll be no more tears in this atmosphere
All that I ask for
Is love that don't hurt, so
Why did you come here?
Tell me, why did you come here?
You're uninvited
I don't know why you feel like you can try to
Come within a hundred miles
I'm a fighter
But I don't want to fight the cold
And every damn time that you come close
I'm frozen like an ice
I'm frozen like an ice
I don't know what you came here for
Been frozen like an ice (ice)
My whole world turns to ice
My whole world turns to ice
My whole world turns to
You might also likeYou
Don't understand the weight of what you do
But I made it to the other side, I'm through
Now took this heart, and you can see this beatin' from a dead cold start
All that I ask for
Is love that don't hurt, so
Why did you come here?
Tell me, why did you come here?
You're uninvited
I don't know why you feel like you can try to
Come within a hundred miles
I'm a fighter
But I don't want to fight the cold
And every damn time that you come close
I'm frozen like an ice
I'm frozen like an ice
I don't know what you came here for
Been frozen like an icicle (ice)
My whole world turns to ice
My whole world turns to ice
My whole world turns to
I can hold my head up high
As frost covers the ground
And I can see sunlight
Through these clouds
Yeah, yeah
You're uninvited
I don't know why you feel like you can try to
Come within a hundred miles
I'm a fighter
But I don't want to fight the cold
And every damn time that you come close
I'm frozen like an ice
I'm frozen like an ice
I don't know what you came here for
Been frozen like an ice (ice)
Frozen like an ice
I'm frozen like an ice
I don't know what you came here for
Been frozen like an ice (an ice)
