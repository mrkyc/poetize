And watched it slip right through your hands?
Sometimes it takes a while just to see
The hardest thing to let go of is a dream
We were more than lonely searching souls
Stumbling across the universe
And i can hardly take this in
Oh, it hurts to think of what might have been
I hope you find just what you're looking for
And I hope it sets you free
Hope four-leaf clovers fall down from the sky
And sun shines on your feet
Whatever in this world you want
I hope you get it all and more
Now know i wish you love and happiness
But i hope i'm your biggest regret
Your biggest regret
I hope that when my heart has been returned
That deep inside you'll always feel this burn
I hope you see me never looking back
And hear me in a passing stranger's laugh
You might also likeI know that we were just a chapter in this life
And our story didn't feel right
Like when two worlds just collided
So why do I hope that in the back of your mind
I hope you find just what you're looking for
And I hope it sets you free
Hope four-leaf clovers fall down from the sky
And sun shines on your feet
Whatever in this world you want
I hope you get it all and more
Now know i wish you love and happiness
But i hope i'm your biggest regret
Hope i'm your biggest regret
And when you're looking back at life's unfolding picture
I'll be more than a fading photograph on the floor
In that closet where you keep all your memories of me
I hope you find just what you're looking for
And I hope it sets you free
Hope four-leaf clovers fall down from the sky
And sun shines
I hope you find just what you're looking for
And I hope it sets you free
Hope four-leaf clovers fall down from the sky
And sun shines on your feet
Whatever in this world you want
I hope you get it all and more
Now know i wish you love and happiness
But i hope i'm your biggest regret
Your biggest regret
Now I wish you love and happiness
But i hope i'm your biggest regret
