I'll be up all weekend that's because the
DJ is my lover
The Dj is my lover
I can rock his socks off
I'm just rocking his show tell me if
The DJ is my lover?
The DJ is my lover
It's almost Friday night slip into the light
Watch the stuff go down down twinkle in my eye
Put away the stress
Change into the dress that he says that he loves
Now I must confess he thinks nobody knows
I'm sleeping in his clothes
But we're sneaking like we're scheming
Like we're scared which kind of shows
'Cause once the lights go off and all the music fades
We do what we do and no one knows our name
We're just the two of us no flashing lights without the club
We're trying hard to beat the sunrise
But I got a confession
I can't even sleep in
I'll be up all weekend that's because the
DJ is my lover
The DJ is my lover
I can rock his sock off
I'm just rocking his show tell me if
The DJ is my lover?
The DJ is my lover

The DJ is my lover
The DJ is my lover
He plays all my requests he knows I like best
He gets all of the numbers mine's the one he don't forget
Miami to New York from London to LA give him what we wants
So I know he'll never stray
I know what only two of us can know my DJ puts on quite a show
But when he comes home, and I got a confession
I can't even sleep in
