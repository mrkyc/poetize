Every time that you told me
That we would write our own story
There was something in your voice
That made me believe you
For every way that you steal my heart
For everything that you are
There's something 'bout your love that
Tells me I need you

But you can't get started
When you're heavy-hearted
We're both fighting gravity
And it's making it hard to breathe
When your hope gets frozen
And your fears unspoken
'Cause you don't wanna fall again
Well, I'm falling too

If this love's enough for you
And this love's enough for me
Then why can't we overcome this gravity?
It's pushing down on you
It's pulling down on me
Why can't we overcome this gravity?

We can't get off the ground, yeah

Everybody gets afraid
Of saying what they wanna say
They don't want their words to
Get caught in the open
I wanna take that chance on you
Knowing all that I got to lose
Standing on this road
But I don't know where it's going

But you can't get started
When you're heavy-hearted
We're both fighting gravity
And it's making it hard to breathe
When your hope gets frozen
And your fears unspoken
'Cause you don't wanna fall again
Well, I'm falling too
If this love's enough for you
And this love's enough for me
Then why can't we overcome this gravity?
It's pushing down on you
It's pulling down on me
Why can't we overcome this gravity?

We can't get off the ground (Oh, yeah)
We can't get off the ground (This gravity)
We can't get off the ground (This gravity)
We can't get off the ground (Oh)
We can't get off the ground (This gravity)
We can't get off the ground
Why can't we overcome, yeah

I, I wonder what you're thinking
I, I gotta find a reason
I, I want your love to lift me off the ground
I, I wonder what you're thinking
I, I gotta find a reason
I, I want your love to lift me off the ground

If this love's enough for you
And this love's enough for me
Then why can't we overcome this gravity?
It's pushing down on you
It's pulling down on me
Why can't we overcome this gravity?
We can't get off the ground (Off the ground)
We can't get off the ground (This gravity)
We can't get off the ground (This gravity)
We can't get off the ground (Off the ground)
We can't get off the ground (This gravity)
We can't get off the ground (This gravity)
We can't get off the ground
