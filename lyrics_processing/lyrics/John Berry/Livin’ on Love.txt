I didn't know I was getting into
When I got my first taste of you
You were just what I was lookin' for
And once I had a little I had to have more
'Cause I'd wake up moanin' in the middle of the night
The sound of your name was all that sounded right
Ran back to your door all soaked with sweat
Had to have your kiss before I starved to death
When you're livin' on love, it's all you need
A constant hunger that you've got to feed
Livin' on love, there ain't no doubt
It's the one thing that you can't live without
You can have the world, but you still wouldn't have enough
None of that matters when you're livin' on love
Nothing else matters when you're livin' on love
Some folks just don't seem to understand
How I seem to survive on the touch of your hand
I don't need to eat, I don't need no rest
If I can get my fill of your tenderness
When I get wore down and feelin' rough
A long cool drink from your lovin' cup
Makes me feel better, makes me feel strong
Oh have mercy on me if I find you gone

A constant hunger that you've got to feed
Livin' on love, and there ain't no doubt
It's the one thing that you can't live without
You can have the world, but you still wouldn't have enough
None of that matters when you're livin' on love
Nothing else matters when you're livin' on love
Livin' on love, it's all you need
A powerful hunger that you've got to feed
Livin' on love, oh yeah
Livin' on love, that's all you need
Livin' on love, I said, that all you need, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'd wake up moanin' in the middle of the night
That's all you need, livin' on love
