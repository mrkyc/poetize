You see a little boy huggin' on a black lab
'Cause after two weeks it came back home
A lady goin' through stage four, sayin', "Thank you Lord" 'cause the cancer's gone
A couple seein' two pink lines for the first time after tryin' for a while
Wouldn't be too hard to find a smile

If good news sold
The world wouldn't seem so bad
If good news sold
We'd be buyin' everything they had
And we'd all sleep a little bit better at night
All be a little less left or right
And turnin' the TV on and checkin' your phone wouldn't ever get old
If good news sold

Hearing 'bout somebody changin' tires for somebody else
They just met on the side of the road
See an umpire stop the game 'cause a soldier came home
And his son didn't know
And he came runnin' in from second base
Tears runnin' down his face
Been a year since he's been back
We'd all be cryin' watchin' that

Hearing 'bout somebody comin' out of a river
Hands up 'cause they just found Jesus
I'd turn it on every mornin' just to see it
