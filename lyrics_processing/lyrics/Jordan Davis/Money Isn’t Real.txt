I showed up to the service
In a '98 Chevrolet
It was just me and the preacher there
To lay him in the ground that day
And I was always jealous
Of everything I thought he had
Might have died a millionaire
But lookin' at them empty chairs
Guess I ain't got it that bad

'Cause money isn't real
It can't call you like your mama does
It can't make you old friends
It can't make you young again
It can't buy you real love
It's just paper and some ink
It'll never ask you how you feel
Dollar doesn't make you rich
When it comes to happiness
Money isn't real, money isn't real

I believe in workin' hard
'Cause it helps when you got it
Keeps the rain outside
And the food on the table
And the water runnin' in the faucet
All I'm sayin' is don't bet your whole life on it

Yeah, you can spend your life savin' up
But you'll never have enough
Money isn't real
No matter if you're rich or broke
You can't take it when you go
