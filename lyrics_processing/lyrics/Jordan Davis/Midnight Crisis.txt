I wish that I could solve this with a convertible
Or drop a thousand on some boots that ain't returnable
Yeah, it'd be nice, if my hair was gray
I'd dye it back brown and I'd be okay
I wish that I could solve this with a convertible

But this is a midnight crisis 'cause I ain't got you
No, I ain't got you with me in this midnight crisis
I'm wide awake, I'm playin' back our history, oh
All that I'm wantin' is you right now
It hit me right out of the blue
Ain't never felt nothin' like this
This is a midnight crisis

(Ooh)

I coulda swore I saw your car pull in my driveway
(Yeah, your car was in my driveway)
And if it did, you know I'd let you into my place, mm
(Yeah, I'd let you into my place)
You'd walk in the room and be the mistake
That would undo all the progress I've made
I coulda swore I saw your car pull in my driveway (Oh-oh)
