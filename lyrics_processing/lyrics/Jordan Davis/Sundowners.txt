Waves crashing on her feet
Standing in some rolled up jeans
Making tracks in the sand
It's like she's living in a photograph
But disappearing silouhette
Flip flops in her hands

And every kiss is burnt and hot
I can't let them go to waste
Let's say the night is all that we've got
And I'm ready for the chase

We can be sundowners, edge of towners
Waiting on a spark
Silent sounders, come unwounders
Tangled in the dark
Like the moon is hanging lets keep this dream awake
Let's go out into the AM
But tonight let's be some sundowners (sundowners)

Blue gives into the black
Red lips just like a match
That sets me on fire
While the whole world falls asleep
Every look that you're giving me
Is taking me higher

And every kiss is burnt and hot
I can't let them go to waste
And once we start, we can't stop
Like 80 with no brakes

We can be sundowners, edge of towners
Waiting on a spark
Silent sounders, come unwounders
Tangled in the dark
Like the moon is hanging, lets keep this dream awake
Let's go out into the AM
But tonight let's be some sundowners (sundowners)

We can be the only two up
When they close down this town
Lets just live it up til it comes back around
We can be sundowners
We can be come unwounders

Sundowners, edge of towners
Waiting on a spark
Silent sounders, come unwounders
Tangled in the dark
Like the moon is hanging, lets keep this dream awake
Let's go out until the AM
But tonight let's be some sundowners
Let's just be some come unwounders
We can be some play it louders
Gotta start sundowners
(Yeah) Sundowners
