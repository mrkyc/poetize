I know my way to your place
Like the back of my hand
There's a key on this chain
That'll spin your lock and let me in
And I'm thinkin' 'bout us again
I'm thinkin' 'bout cavin' in when

I should stop right now and go back home
Turn on that TV, stare at the wall and just sleep alone
Never turn down your block
I know I need to not
Get too close 'cause you know that I'll cross that line
You say you miss me, your kiss hits me one more time
Don't wanna give us one more shot
I know I need to not
I need to not, I need to not

These lights flashing
Red light means I'm two turns from your street
The one goin' off in my head
Ain't slowin' down anything

'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout seein' you
I'm thinkin' about what I'll do when

Turn on that TV, stare at the wall and just sleep alone
Never turn down your block
I know I need to not
Get too close 'cause you know that I'll cross that line
You say you miss me, your kiss hits me one more time
Don't wanna give us one more shot
I know I need to not
Oh, and I need to not, I need to not

Oh
Yeah, I need to not

I need to not touch you
I need to not look in your eyes
Need to come to my senses
And get the hell out of your driveway

I should stop right now and go back home
Turn on that TV, stare at the wall and just sleep alone
Never turn down your block
I know I need to not
Get too close 'cause you know that I'll cross that line
You say you miss me, your kiss hits me one more time
Don't wanna give us one more shot
I know I need to not
I need to not, I need to not
