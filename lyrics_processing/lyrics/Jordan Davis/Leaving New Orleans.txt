I miss the Quarter
The magnolias and the Pontchartrain
French market on a Saturday
I'll miss the feel of this place
I miss the Bayou sunrise
The Mardi Gras and the second lines
Bourbon, jazz, sidewalk kids
With bottle cap taps, dancing for tips

But I'm leaving New Orleans
There's too much of you in this town
Your memory is like moss in the trees
Every corner it's just hanging around
Well, The Big Easy ain't so easy
Hard to say it but baby come morning
I'll be rolling like the Mississippi leaving New Orleans

Well I like highways
So maybe LA is the place for me
If I point these wheels toward the Hollywood sign
All those miles to clear my mind
Or I could watch a horse race on some bluegrass
Where bourbon's made
Catch some rays in the Sunshine State
Hit Seattle if I need a little rain

But I'm leaving New Orleans
There's too much of you in this town
Your memory's like moss in the trees
Every corner it's just hanging around
Well, The Big Easy ain't so easy
Hard to say it but baby come morning
I'll be rolling like the Mississippi leaving New Orleans

I guess our good times have rolled away
Well laissez les bons temps rouler

I'm leaving New Orleans
There's too much of you in this town
Your memory is like moss in the trees
Every corner it's just hanging around
Well, The Big Easy ain't so easy
Hard to say it but baby come morning

Yeah, I'm Leaving New Orleans
There's too much of you in this town
Your memory is like moss in the trees
Every quarter is just hanging around
Well, The Big Easy ain't so easy
Hard to say it but baby come morning
I'll be rolling like the Mississippi leaving New Orleans
Yeah, I'm leaving New Orleans
Goodbye New Orleans
