A few days 'fore he turned eighty
He was sittin out back in a rocker
He said, "What you been up to lately?"
I told him, "Chasin' a dollar"
And in-between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out
Said, "If you want my two cents on makin' a dollar count"

Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love, but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks and the grass in the yard all grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt

Before you get caught on that ladder
Let me tell you what it's all about
Find you a few things that matter
That you can put a fence around
Then he laid it out

Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love, but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks and the grass in the yard all grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt
Yeah, you can buy dirt

And thank the good Lord for it
'Cause He ain't makin' any more of it

So buy dirt
And find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love, but call it work
Throw a little money in the plate at church
And send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks and the grass in the yard all grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt
(You can't buy happiness)
