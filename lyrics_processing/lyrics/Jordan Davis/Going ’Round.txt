I still got your number and I wonder
What you're doing tonight
I heard you were hurting but he wasn't worth it
Well I could've told you he wasn't right

Well some buddies of mine
They said you had a big fight in town
You ran off crying
At least that's what's going around

Know how those rumors fly
Sometimes they're all a lie
Burn up before they hit the ground
But right now they're going 'round
I don't wanna move in too soon
I know your heartbreak is brand new
If I never would've let you down
This probably wouldn't be going 'round

(Round and round and round and round)
Probably wouldn't be going 'round

It might've been time
And it might've been my bad
But I wanna try again
Another dance
A second chance
If you are in, I'd be in

Well some buddies of mine
They said you had a big fight in town
You ran off crying
At least that's what's going around
