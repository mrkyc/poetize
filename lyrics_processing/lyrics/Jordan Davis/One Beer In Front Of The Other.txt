Had a long run of some long nights
Had some cold sweats from seeing taillights
Fading like a Louisiana sunset
Memory's been beating me up and it ain't done yet

Been going through the go 'round
Since you turned this bedroom into a ghost town
So, unless you got a heart that I can borrow
The only way that I can make it to tomorrow

Is putting one beer in front of the other
Linkin' drink rings into another
'Cause your goodbye kinda hurt like a mother
But I'm thinking maybe that I'm on the upper
Of the downside
And lining 'em up into a straight line
I ain't gonna lie
So if you wonder how I'm doing, brother
I'm putting one beer in front of the other
(One beer)

We had a good thing, yeah, I thought so
Even had your picture taped up to my console
Now I'm the loneliest shade of blue in a rainbow
The only way to make the moving on train go

So if you wonder how I'm doing, brother
I'm putting one beer in front of the other

I ain't there yet, no, I ain't there yet
But I'm finding closure with every cold one that I get
There's light up ahead, there's light up ahead
And it's getting closer with every sip

Putting one beer in front of the other
Linkin' drink rings into another
Because your goodbye kinda hurt like a mother
But I'm thinking maybe that I'm on the upper
Of the downside
And lining 'em up into a straight line
