Whiskey weak

Used to be
A dive bar, a few two-for-ones
Would get her real far off my mind
In no time
I'd be on my way to moving on

Some goodbyes you get over fast
When they leave it's done
But yours ain't like that at all
This last call
Ain't turning out the way I want

'Cause you ain't gettin' gone

Ain't nothin' working like it did before
This ain't lookin' good
All these double pours
Ain't doing what they should
She stole the bright out the neon
Got me running up these tabs
Made every song out the jukebox
Sound nothing but sad
Made my bed feel like razors
My friends feel like strangers
Her 'Goodbye' ruined everything
Her leaving even made the whiskey weak (Whiskey weak)

Hey, barkeep
You might wanna check
Them bottles on the shelf
'Cause I ain't feeling nothin' yet
And I should be well on my way
Three sheets to the wind
But I'm still missing her and I'm three doubles in

Ain't nothin' working like it did before
This ain't lookin' good
All these double pours
Ain't doing what they should
She stole the bright out the neon
Got me running up these tabs
Made every song out the jukebox
Sound nothing but sad
Made my bed feel like razors
My friends feel like strangers
Her 'Goodbye' ruined everything
Her leaving even made the whiskey weak

And if her memory ain't gonna drown
Then rock bottom's gonna be a long way down
Ain't nothin' working like it did before
This ain't lookin' good
These double pours
Ain't doing what they should
She stole the bright out the neon
Got me running up these tabs
Made every song out the jukebox
Sound nothing but sad
Made my bed feel like razors
My friends feel like strangers
Her 'Goodbye' ruined everything
Her leaving even made the whiskey weak
