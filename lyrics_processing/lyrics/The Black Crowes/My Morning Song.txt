Dizzy found me last night
I saw some kind of new light
Ooh, I woke up in a whirlwind
Hey baby, just you watch my head spin
The spectacle that made you cry
It's a thrill-a-minute plane ride
It's over time at ring side, no lie

March me down to the seven seas
Bury me with a ruby ring
Kiss me, baby, on an Easter Sunday day
Make my haze blow away
Aw, make it blow away

I hide, I seek, I go and I find
Truth in a fable, faith in a rhyme
So why they want to bad talk me?
Are they surprised by what we see?
Like my table and my tide turn
Like on my bed, the emperor worn
Ooh, is that enough for me, it could be

March me down to the seven seas
Bury me with a ruby ring
Kiss me, baby, on an Easter Sunday day
Make my haze blow away
I say, make it blow away

You're right in my ears
Now for permanent ever gonna be clear
Stick a needle in my eyes
And my whole family goin' to ask you why
Fuck it


If music got to free your mind
Just let it go, baby, let it go
'Cause you never know, you never know
Say, if your rhythm ever falls out of time
You can bring it to me
And I promise I will make it fine, yes I will
If your heart is beating free
For the very first time it will be alright, yes it will, yes it will
If your soul is let go
Oh baby, you never know
No, you never know, you never know
If your rhythm ever falls out of time
You can bring it to me and I will, yes I will make it alright
Oh, there gonna be enough time, baby
But if I try, if I try
Ooh, will you let it? Oh, yeah, will you let your soul go?
Let your mind go? Let your heart go? Let your soul go?
Will you let it? Oh yeah, oh yeah, I just wanna try
Aw, make it alright, make it alright, oh yeah
March me down to the seven seas
Bury me with a ruby ring
Oh, kiss me, baby, on an Easter Sunday day
Make my haze blow away
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
March me down to the seven seas
Bury me with a ruby ring
Kiss me, baby, on an Easter Sunday day
