Baby, here I am, I'm the man on the scene
I can give you what you want, but you gotta come home with me
I've got some good old lovin', and I got some more in store
When I get through throwin' it on you, you got to come back for more

Boys and things that come by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Hey little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause, mama, I'm so hard to handle now
Yes sir, I'm

Action speaks louder than words, and I'm a man of great experience
I know you got another man, but I can love you better than him
Take my hand, don't be afraid, I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free, so you can place your ad with me

Boys will come along, a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but ten cent lovin'
Hey little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause, mama, I'm so hard to handle now
Yes sir, I'm
Yeah
Hard to handle, now
