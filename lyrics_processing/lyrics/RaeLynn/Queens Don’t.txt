I wasn't raised in a castle
I grew up on the outskirts of town
No dresses with golden tassels
The rings on my hand are handed down
But I'm gonna find the one that needs me, sees me and treats me
Like I'm already royalty
There ain't nothing priceless on my wrist, I might not fly private
But that don't mean I ain't a queen

Queens don't hate, queens don't fight
Queens don't stay unless their king treats her right, oh
Every jewel on my crown, you better believe I earned it
Won't keep people around that don't believe I deserve it
No, queens ain't fake
A queen's gonna rule just the way she was made, oh
I ain't 'bout to let nobody come and take me off this throne
Some girls might, but queens don't

No, I don't need the tallest tower
To prove to anyone I ain't weak
I turn my pain into power
Every tear's a diamond on my cheek

Some girls might, but queens don't

Queens don't break, they just get stronger
There ain't nothing they can't conquer

Queens don't hate, queens don't fight
Queens don't stay unless their king treats her right, oh
