I'm too young to think about forever
I'm just thinkin' 'bout this Friday night
I love not knowin' where we're going
And dancin' with the boy I kinda like
I wanna make all my mistakes
While I'm young enough to make them once or twice
Maybe three times

'Cause I ain't looking for
My Prince Charming on a horse
No, once upon a time ain't where I'm at
(Right now it ain't my style)
Yeah, I don't need a mister
Tryin' to fit that perfect slipper
On my foot
There's always time for that
(This girl is young and wild)

So, I'm gonna spend all summer long
Sittin' on this river log
'Cause right now there ain't nothing wrong
With having fun and kissin' frogs
Yeah, kissin' frogs

Right now the only thing that matters
Is the radio and screamin' every song
I'm happy without "Happy Ever After"
Yeah, a little making-out don't hurt no one
I wanna have a little fun
Someday I'm gonna find the one that's right
But not tonight

'Cause I ain't looking for
My Prince Charming on a horse
No, once upon a time ain't where I'm at
(Right now it ain't my style)
Yeah, I don't need a mister
Tryin' to fit that perfect slipper
