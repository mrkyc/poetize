Only in a small town
Do you spend Saturday in a Walmart
With a snot-nosed kid in a shopping cart
'Cause it's the only store around and everything's marked down
Only in a small town
A girl can go out in some Real Tree
And not get judged at a Mickey Ds
Give me the number 3, supersized, and an 8-count
There's no cell phone bars
There's more trucks than cars

Only in a small town
Do you live for Friday
Always take a backroad, never take a highway
You fry what you eat and the tea is sweet
Keep a dog in the shotgun seat
Only in the backwoods
Do you have your first kiss
And you catch your first buzz when you catch your first fish
You can look around the whole wide world for a girl like me
But we gon' be
Only in a small town
Only in a small town

Only in a small town
Does your ex-boyfriend get locked up
And knock up your best girl friend (What?)
Spending every bit of my $10.25 an hour
To throw her a shower

Hell, only in a small town
Do you live for Friday
Always take a backroad, never take a highway
You fry what you eat and the tea is sweet
Keep a dog in the shotgun seat
Only in the backwoods
Do you have your first kiss
And you catch your first buzz when you catch your first fish
You can look around the whole wide world for a girl like me
But we gon' be
Only in a small town
Only in a small town

No cell phone bars
There's more trucks than cars
And you can steal my heart
Underneath them stars
Only in a small town
Yeah, only in a small town
Some things you can't find in the city
Yeah, something this down-home pretty
Is only in a small town
Do you live for Friday
Always take a backroad, never take a highway
You fry what you eat and the tea is sweet
Keep a dog in the shotgun seat
Only in the backwoods
Do you have your first kiss
And you catch your first buzz when you catch your first fish
You can look around the whole wide world for a girl like me
But we gon' be
Only in a small town
Only in a small town

Yeah, only in a small town
