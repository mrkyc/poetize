Yeah, she's gonna have a Barbie Jeep
But she's gonna get it stuck in the creek
With her dog named Dolly in the passenger seat
With some red clay mud on her little bare feet
She'll have pink painted on her toes
While she's drinking from the water hose
Growing up where the sweet corn grows
With her Sunday school down the road

'Cause I'm raising me a country girl
Don't be fooled by her golden curls
She's sweet as sugar but tough as nails
Loving her daddy but giving boys hell
She didn't fall far from the tree
Every day I see a little more me
Yeah I'm on my knees every night praying
And thanking God I'm raising me a country girl

Oh-ooh
Raising me a country girl
Oh-ooh

She'll pick her own berries on the farm
And want her a pony in the barn
She'll watch hunting shows and love football
And call her grand-daddy paw-paw

Yeah, she's pretty as a picture in a summer dress
But she ain't scared of dirt and loves to fish
