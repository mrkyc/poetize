We were a couple kids in a pickup fooling around
We learned how to keep it so nobody found out
Mama don't need to know everything, some things you keep to yourself
Like dumb things you do when you're seventeen on the DL

But if that tailgate ever tells, I'll be the small talk of the town
I'm sure I'd catch all kinds of hell for every time we laid it down
In the back of that race red F-150, we get to kissin', we get to slippin'
Off clothes and nobody knows and only will if that tailgate ever tells

Tailgate, don't tell on me, don't tell on me, tailgate (If that tailgate ever tells)
Tailgate, don't tell on me, don't tell on me, tailgate

You, me, we had bare feet hanging off the edge
Two drinks, then we'd lay it on back in the bed
Mama don't need to know everything, 'cause some things you keep to yourself
We knew that's all that we'd ever be, on the DL

But if that tailgate ever tells, I'll be the small talk of the town
I'm sure I'd catch all kinds of hell for every time we laid it down
In the back of that race red F-150, we get to kissin', we get to slippin'
Off clothes and nobody knows and only will if that tailgate ever tells

Tailgate, don't tell on me, don't tell on me, tailgate (If that tailgate ever tells)
Tailgate, don't tell on me, don't tell on me, tailgate

What happens on a dirt road stays on a dirt road out here
What we're doing in the dark when we're underneath the stars is our own business

But if that tailgate ever tells, I'll be the small talk of the town
I'm sure I'd catch all kinds of hell for every time we laid it down
In the back of that race red F-150, we get to kissin', we get to slippin'
Off clothes and nobody knows and only will if that tailgate ever tells

Tailgate, don't tell on me, don't tell on me, tailgate (If that tailgate ever tells)
Tailgate, don't tell on me, don't tell on me, tailgate (Tailgate don't tell, no)
Tailgate, don't tell on me, don't tell on me, tailgate (Don't tell on me, tailgate)
