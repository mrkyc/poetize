Are you gonna cry?
Are you gonna air your dirty laundry
On a Saturday night?
Are you gonna call your friends, sing karaoke?
Gonna sit at home all sad and lonely?
Lookin' like hell, 'cause your mascara's runnin', yeah?
Are you gonna cut your hair and dye it blonde?
Turn off your phone, turn up the song
Look in the mirror and feel like your nothing?

You think you know

You think you know who you are
In somebody's arms
But you don't know
No, you don't know
Yeah, you don't know who you are
'Til somebody breaks your heart

Ha-ha-ha-ha-heart
