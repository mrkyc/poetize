She was a Bible Belt lovin' believer
With a twelve year ring on her hand
Got a little too close to the fire
And started burning for another man
One thing led to another
At a motel in Galveston Bay
They didn't know it at the time
But more than just love was made
That's one hell of a choice to make

If it went the other way nobody woulda blamed her
Think of all the small town talk it would have saved her
She could have chosen one quick fix
To get her out of one big mess
She could have tied a different ribbon to the ending of the story
Could have kept her secret, gotten out before it changed her life
She could have changed her mind and changed everything
But she chose me

She didn't quite know how to tell him
You try to speak a truth like that
She didn't know where to turn to
But she knew a way to take it back
She had it written into her schedule
Like just another thing to do
But that box never got checked off
And I'm sitting here living proof

But she chose me, yeah

Me the daughter, me the sister
Me the dreamer with pigtails in pictures
Me the wife my husband loves
I'm just thankful because
