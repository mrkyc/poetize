You must be from Tennessee
'Cause you're the only ten I see (Damn)
Did the sun come out or did you just smile at me? I must be
Still asleep passed out in my room 'cause you're lookin' like a dream come true (For real)
What does it take for a girl like me to leave this bar with a guy like you?

I bet you get that all the time (All the time)
You're probably getting pretty used to it (Pretty used to it)
I bet you memorized the lines (All the lines)
I know that this ain't nothing new to ya (Nothing new to you)
So let's skip the, "What's your drink" and go out and dance
Ain't no need to over think it, give me a chance
I know that you could have anyone in here tonight
But you'd be, better off mine
I bet you get that all the time

You're the kinda girl, I wanna take home to my nana
Prettiest thing I've ever seen from LA to Savannah
Georgia, you're gorgeous, baby girl you're fine
I look around ain't hard to see why

I bet you get that all the time (All the time)
You're probably getting pretty used to it (Probably getting pretty used to it)
I bet you memorized the lines (All the lines)
I know that this ain't nothing new to ya (Ain't nothing new to you, baby)
So let's skip the, "What's your drink" and (Hey), go out and dance
Ain't no need to over think it, give me a chance
I know that you could have anyone in here tonight
But you'd be, better off mine
I bet you get that all the time
All the time
