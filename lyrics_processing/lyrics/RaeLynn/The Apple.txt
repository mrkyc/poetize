Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I remember bliss was ignorance
Love was without risk or consequence
I should've listened when they told me not to
But you were leanin' in, I didn't stop you
So innocent

Then I ate the apple
And kissed you, bit into the mystery
And everything just started to unravel
'Cause I ate the apple
And loved it, for a minute, I was in it
But I didn't know a heart could be so fragile
'Til I ate the apple
Oh-oh, oh-oh
'Til I ate the apple
Oh-oh, oh-oh

You were sweet and that was all I saw
At 10 P.M. right up against the wall
I wasn't one to give in to temptation
I guess you never know until you taste it
I took the fall

'Til I ate the apple
Oh-oh, oh-oh
'Til I ate the apple

I'll fall in love someday
But in some way, I'll still be yours
I'll never see the world again the way I did before

I ate the apple
And kissed you, bit into the mystery
