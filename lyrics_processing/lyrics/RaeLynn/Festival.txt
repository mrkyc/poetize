We didn't care what we looked like
Dripping in sweat and desert vibes
We didn't care who was watching, no
Our cotton candy make out on the side of

A Ferris wheel I was scared to ride
But I knew that I could do it with you by my side

We felt like VIP's in the background
Couldn't keep from kissing, getting glitter on your nose
When your body was holding me close
Yeah it was magical, anything but typical
It was a hell of a sunset dream
You were all over me like we were seventeen
Yeah it was magical, anything but typical
We fell in love, we fell in love at a festival

We fell in love
We fell in love
We fell in love at a festival
We fell in love
We fell in love
We fell in love at a festival

I couldn't stop staring at you
Wearing glow sticks on your tattooed arm
I couldn't help the way I felt
I didn't know you but you had my heart

In the middle of that big, crazy crowd
You're the only single person that stood out

We felt like VIP's in the background
Couldn't keep from kissing, getting glitter on your nose
When your body was holding me close
Yeah it was magical, anything but typical
It was a hell of a sunset dream
You were all over me like we were seventeen
Yeah it was magical, anything but typical
We fell in love, we fell in love at a festival

We fell in love
We fell in love
We fell in love at a festival
We fell in love
We fell in love
We fell in love at a festival
Short shorts, rock shirts, singing every song
You had my heart all night long
Short shorts, rock shirts, singing every song
You had my heart all night long

We fell in love at a festival
We fell in love
We fell in love
We fell in love at a festival
We fell in love
(Short shorts, rock shirts singing every song)
We fell in love
We fell in love at a festival
