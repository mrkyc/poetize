In the blink, of an eye
I feel the twist of a knife
In the flash of a smile
I see her heart on the prowl

She knows what she's doin'
She knows I can tell
She'd love to see me lose it
But I tell myself

No, don't get insecure
No, he ain't into her
She's playin' dirty, all flirty
From across the room
You might think she's a ten
But she don't count to him
'Cause girl, he's busy, gettin' dizzy
All around you
Don't waste a second, second guessin'
Get obsessed with her obsessin'
He's all yours, he ain't hers
She ain't worth gettin' insecure
(Oh, oh, oh)

Yeah, it ain't his fault
That when he talks, they all fall
I know they all want to take him
And the truth is, I can't blame them
'Cause he's tall dark and handsome
And still sweet as hell
In moments of weakness
I tell myself

No, don't get insecure
No, he ain't into her
She's playin' dirty, all flirty
From across the room
You might think she's a ten
But she don't count to him
'Cause girl, he's busy, gettin' dizzy
All around you
Don't waste a second, second guessin'
Get obsessed with her obsessin'
He's all yours, he ain't hers
She ain't worth gettin' insecure
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
Don't waste a second, second guessing
Get obsessed with her obsessing
Tell the voice inside my head

No, don't get insecure
No, he ain't into her
She's playin' dirty, all flirty
From across the room
You might think she's a ten
But she don't count to him
'Cause girl, he's busy, gettin' dizzy
All around you
Don't waste a second, second guessin'
Get obsessed with her obsessin'
He's all yours, he ain't hers
She ain't worth gettin' insecure

(Oh, oh, oh)
(Don't waste a second, second guessing)
She ain't worth getting insecure
(Oh, oh, oh)
