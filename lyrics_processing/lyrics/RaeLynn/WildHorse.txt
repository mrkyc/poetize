If you want candy on your arm
If you want pretty lucky charm
If you wanna trophy on your shelf
You better find somebody else
If you want a girl that don't speak her mind
All smiles, all yes, all of the time
I ain't made for these four walls
So let 'em fall

I don't want no fences around me
Nobody boxing me in
Can't saddle me up (Hey)
'Cause I'm the kind of
Girl that needs the wind
Ridin' with that fire in my eyes
Flyin' straight through the open wide

'Cause baby, I'm a wild horse, wild horse
Don't try to tame me
Baby, I'm a wild horse, wild horse
Ain't gonna break me

If you wanna love me, understand
You gotta be down with the way I am
All my flaws and all of my quirks
All my glitter, all my dirt
I gotta think about feeling free
This restless heart, it just won't breathe
And these four walls, they're too small
So let 'em fall

Nothing like a wild horse (Hey)
