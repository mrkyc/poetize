Aren't we all the same?
Hearts with different names
All looking for a place
We can be who we are, and know who we are
Don't we all deserve?
A moment to be heard
Don't we all have words that show who we are?
'Cause we know who we are, yeah

When life's got you feeling' crazy wound up like a ukulele
When you start to think that maybe you don't have a voice
Go on and let your feet stomp 'til your heartbeat feels that beat drop
Yeah, you just gotta stand up and make some noise

When you can't say a thing you can always sing
When you can't say a thing you can always sing

We're all microphones with songs all of our own
And everywhere we go they know who we are
'Cause we know who we are, yeah

When life's got you feeling crazy wound up like a ukulele
When you start to think that maybe you don't have a voice
Go on and let your feet stomp till your heartbeat feels that beat drop
Yeah, you just gotta stand up and make some noise
