I love that mom and pop Wingstop shop
With ten different shades of hot
I love that football field and that wheeling dealing
Down at the used car lot
Yeah, there's folks that I don't talk to
Yeah, there's roads I don't go down
But I love my hometown 'cause it's O.G.
When I walk around everybody knows me
It's like, "Hey, how ya living?"
'Bout as easy as a crick-singing cricket

You don't get this in the city
Like you do out in the sticks
You can't get this kind of pretty
'Bout as real as real can get
'Cause we put the good in the good people
We put a ring on the one we love
Always country coming through the speakers
All the roads all filled with trucks
I love my hometown, holding it down in my hometown
Hometown, holding it down in my hometown
Yeah

At the town square where I hang around
Get my hair did before I let it down
It's a home phone so don't text it
It's a long way off the exit

I love my hometown 'cause it's O.G.
When I walk around everybody knows me
It's like, "Hey, how ya living?" (How ya living?)
'Bout as easy as a crick-singing cricket
