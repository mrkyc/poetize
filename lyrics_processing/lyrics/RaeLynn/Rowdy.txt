I get up round 8am
I get dressed then I get in
A traffic jam, get cut off
And then I get rowdy
I get pumped when it's Friday
Cause I know what's coming my way
As soon as I get back in the driveway
I get rowdy
C'mon

Yeah I get rowdy like a Texas twister getting twisted
Ripping through a trailer park
Rowdy like bo and Luke
And like Daisy Duke dancing on the bar
The redneck thing about me is I'm all hell yeah and howdy
I get rowdy, I get mouthy when I get all my friends around me
You can hear us from across the county
Yeah my crowd we, uh, get rowdy

I get up on Sunday morning
Sing out songs to the Lord and
Ask his forgiveness for the night before
Cause I got rowdy
Yeah I did
