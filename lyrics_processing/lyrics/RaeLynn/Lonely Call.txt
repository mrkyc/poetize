Just a Monday, thrift shop couch
Bowl of Cheerios, it's getting dark out
Clickin' my remote to an episode
Of Crazy Housewives
And before you know
I see your face on my screen
That ringtone can only mean
Your friends are gone
You're all alone
And you're thinkin' 'bout me

I used to be your 6 AM
"Hey, good morning, beautiful, how you been?"
I used to be a "We just landed
Miss you, you can't stand it
See you this weekend"
Now I'm just a midnight number
Familiar voice
When you start to wonder if you made the wrong choice
So let it ring, let it ring all night long
'Cause I ain't your lonely call

It's been three weeks and two days
And twelve hours, but who's counting?
Ten thousand tears, feels like a year
Lookin' for some peace, and I found it
'Cause boy, you said, "Let's take a break"
In the front seat of your Jeep
So if you got more to say
Leave a message at the beep

I ain't your lonely call, call, oh

Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl
Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl
Let it ring
