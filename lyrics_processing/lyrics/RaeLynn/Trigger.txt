Are you really callin' me right now?
Are you really trying to make things right, right now?
Are you really trying to take me out?
Is it really worth working out now?

I don't wanna tell you no, but
I can still see the red in your taillights
I don't wanna see your face 'cause
I know the look in your eyes will change my mind
I can't forget everything you did
You were your own gravedigger
I don't wanna shoot you down, but
You put my finger on the trigger
You put my finger on the trigger

Would you act like I was the bad guy
Or would you try to take the blame?
I don't know if I believe you're sorry
I ain't trying to get wrapped up and stuck in your game

I don't wanna tell you no, but
I can still see the red in your taillights
I don't wanna see your face 'cause
I know the look in your eyes will change my mind
I can't forget everything you did
You were your own gravedigger
I don't wanna shoot you down, but
You put my finger on the trigger
You put my finger on the trigger

I never wanted to tell you no
But I never thought you would go and leave

I don't wanna tell you no, but
I can still see the red in your taillights
I don't wanna see your face 'cause
I know the look in your eyes will change my mind
(Change my mind)
I can't forget everything you did
You were your own gravedigger
I don't wanna shoot you down, but
You put my finger on the trigger
(I can't forget everything you did)
You put my finger on the trigger
(I can't forget everything you did)
You put my finger on the trigger
(I can't forget everything you did)
You put my finger on the trigger
