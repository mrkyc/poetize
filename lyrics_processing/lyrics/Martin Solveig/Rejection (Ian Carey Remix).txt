I spend so much energy, I keep falling down my knees, baby
I spend so much energy but the girl is not for me, I'm down
Try to show a different man but her reaction is the same
I spend so much energy but she keeps rejecting me
Aaaaaaaaha rejection, aaaaaaaaha possession
I spend so much energy on the frantic rivalry
I showed style and my grace, she blew smoke in my face
Can't you see there's nothing wrong about me, baby?
Now it's time to seek and try to find a way
Aaaaaaaaaaha rejection
Before you turn your back on me I wanna get my energy
Aaaaaaaaha possession
Before you turn your back on me I wanna get my energy
Aaaaaaaaaaha rejection
Before you turn your back on me I wanna get my energy
Aaaaaaaaha possession
Before you turn your back on me I wanna get my energy
Ah ah ah
Aaaaaaaaaaha rejection
Before you turn your back on me I wanna get my energy
Aaaaaaaaha possession
Before you turn your back on me I wanna get my energy
Aaaaaaaaaaha rejection
Before you turn your back on me I wanna get my energy
Aaaaaaaaha possession
Before you turn your back on me I wanna get my energy
Aaaaaaaaha rejection, aaaaaaaaha possession
I spend so much energy on the frantic rivalry
I showed style and my grace, she blew smoke in my face
Can't you see there's nothing wrong about me, baby?
Now it's time to seek and try to find a way
Aaaaaaaaaaha rejection
Before you turn your back on me I wanna get my energy
Aaaaaaaaha possession
Before you turn your back on me I wanna get my energy
Aaaaaaaaaaha rejection
Before you turn your back on me I wanna get my energy
Aaaaaaaaha possession
Before you turn your back on me I wanna get my energy
Ah ah ah
Aaaaaaaaaaha rejection
Before you turn your back on me I wanna get my energy
Aaaaaaaaha possession
Before you turn your back on me I wanna get my energy
Aaaaaaaaaaha rejection
Before you turn your back on me I wanna get my energy
Aaaaaaaaha possession
