Dalila U break-break my heart (Da-lila Daaaaaaaa Oh Dalila Dalila)
Oh Dalila, will you dance with me Dalila, oh Dalila, can U stop hiding Dalila ?
Oh Dalila, I am so lonely Dalila, oh Dalila, just one dance with me Dalila ! (x2)
I think our bodies are getting a lil closer, the host in me is giving the most to the hostess
Can't U see I'm going wild wild wild wild ? Gonna check a move left right, left right
Attraction of the negative can always turn positive, your mama papa gonna let U live
Don't U know I'm really sad sad sad ? My patience running out of time time time
There's a tiny little spot in my... heart, I'm not really lucky man from the start
I'm trying to persevere but it's really... hard, communicating with the gal is really tough
Please Dalila gimme a little sign, I'm waiting for Ur love since a long time
Can U make my dream become reality ? Let's getaway from the pressure feel the peace !
Dalila U break my heart, I don't know where 2 start, trying 2 get Ur attention everytime
Oh Dalila, will you dance with me Dalila, oh Dalila, can U stop hiding Dalila ?
Oh Dalila, I am so lonely Dalila, oh Dalila, just one dance with me Dalila ! (x2)
Eeny-Meeny-Minye-May, catch Dalila by the waist
If she disses my I'll wait, try my chance another day
I know this girl's got interest for me, rock the vibe at the Block Party
Block Party, Block Party
Oooooooooooooooooohh
