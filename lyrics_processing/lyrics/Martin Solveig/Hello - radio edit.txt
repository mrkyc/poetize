It doesn't really mean that I'm into you, hello
You're alright but I'm here, darling, to enjoy the party
Don't get too excited 'cause that's all you get from me, hey
Yeah I think you're cute, but I really think that you should know
I just came to say hello, hello, hello, hello
I'm not the kinda girl to get messed up with you, hello
I might let you try to convince me to, hello
It's alright I'm getting dizzy just enjoy the party
It's OK with me if you don't have that much to say, hey
Kinda like this game but there's something you should know

I could stick around and get along with you, hello
