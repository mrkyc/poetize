One two three four, one two three four
It's another world since I saw you girl, trying to get you
It's another place since I saw your face, really something new
One green light, I'm prepared to fight, ain't it what we do ?
For another world, this crazy girl, who wants to play too ?
Come on girl, come and get me, set yourself free
Come and play with me, come on girl
Come and get me, what d'you play for ? Come on girl, one 2 3 four
I'm in another world since I saw you girl, now what's in you ?
Things I wanna show, sure I could go pretty far with you
Do you know the game, wanna get fame ? I can show you
You wanna be acclaimed, I can add your name so you can play too
Come on girl, come and get me, set yourself free
Come and play with me, come on girl
Come and get me, what d'you play for ? Come on girl, one 2 3 four
Come and get me, set yourself free
Come and play with me, come on girl
Come and get me, what d'you play for ? Come on girl, one 2 3 four
Come on girl, come on girl
