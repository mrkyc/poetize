I got this crazy feeling, you are my destiny
I can really feel something, how come you don't notice me ?
I talk a little bit much, you think I'm crazy and such
I imagine something rare, you act like you don't care
Is there something I can do ?
You were made for me and I want you, oh! free and I want
You were made for me and I want you, oh! free and I want you
I feel like a superstar, you seem a little shy
I might try a little too hard and you still wonder why
I believe I could be the answer, you are such a terrific dancer
I want to make you sweat, you've seen nothing yet
Is there something I can do ?
You were made for me and I want you, oh! free and I want
You were made for me and I want you, oh! free and I want
You were made for me and I want you, oh! free and I want
You were made for me and I want you, oh!... I want
You were made for me and I want you, oh! free and I want
You were made for me and I want you, oh! free and I want
You were made for me and I want you, oh! free and I want
You were made for me and I want you, oh! free and I want you
(Instrumental)
You are, you are free and I want
You are, you are, you are, you oh! free and I want
You were made for me and I want you, oh! free and I want
You were made for me and I want you, oh!... I want...
You were made for me and I want you, oh! free and I want
You were made for me and I want you, oh! free and I want
You were made for me and I want you, oh! free and I want
