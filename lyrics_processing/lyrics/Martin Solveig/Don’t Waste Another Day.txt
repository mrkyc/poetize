Don't waste another day, you know why you're here for
You know I love you, I love you more than I might say
I need you, won't leave you before the morning says...
So is there something wrong?
It's been a while since you've been gone
So let me hold you before dawn, then it's a brand new day
Don't waste another day, there's no way you can hide
Don't waste another day, just let yourself slide
'Cause I care for you and I've been waiting for too long
I need you, won't leave you before the morning says...
So is there something wrong?
Is it so hard to make things right?
Why don't we let go for one night? Then it's a brand new day
Da, da da, da da, da da, da da, da da
Da da, da da, da da, da da, da da, da da
Is it so hard to make things right?
Why don't we let go for one night?
Then it's a brand new day, a brand new day
Don't waste another day, you know why you came for
(I like to see you smile, this fire in your eyes)
Don't waste another day, you know why you're here for
(I like to see you shine)
Don't waste another day, you know why you came for
(Cause it's so natural, there's nothing wrong for you and I)
Don't waste another day, you know why you're here for
(To get together baby)
Don't waste another day, you know why you came for
(Don't waste another day)
Don't waste another day, you know why you're here for
(Ahh ahh cause it's a brand new day)
Don't waste another day, you know why you came for
(A brand new day, a brand new day)
Don't waste another day, you know why you're here for
(Ooooh)
