Ooh, my darling, I'm thinking about how my life has changed, me and you
Our passion, sensation, feels like I'm a different man now
Ooh, so strong for too long, I've been searching for a girl like
You change it all since I found you, really made it better
I've run for something better, I've dreamt of something better
I run for something better, you're something better for me
I've run for something better, I've dreamt of something better
I run for something better, you're something better for me
Something better, something better for me
Now I'm caught up, so tied up
But don't be a player babe or I could wait for
More, more action, I'm checking your reaction
Cause I wanna do it and I want you to be happy with it
I don't care, it sounds fair to flee dismal reality 'cause
You change it all since I found you, really made it better
I've run for something better, I've dreamt of something better
(You made it better, you made it better)
I run for something better, you're something better for me. (Oooh)
I've run for something better, I've dreamt of something better
(You made it better, you made it better)
I run for something better, you're something better for me. (Hey hey)
Darling I've been waiting all my life and I'm so glad that I found you
You and I connect without a doubt, I'm so thankful for having you
(I'm thankful, thankful)
