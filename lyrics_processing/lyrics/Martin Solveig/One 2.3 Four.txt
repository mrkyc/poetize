It's another world since I saw you girl, trying to get you
It's another place since I saw your face, really something new
Why drift life on the better side, ain't it what we do ?
For another world, to straight a girl, who wants to play too ?
Come on girl, come and get me, set yourself free
Come and play with me, come on girl
Come and get me, what d'you play for ? Come on girl, one 2 3 four
I'm in another world since I saw you girl, now what's in you ?
Things I wanna show, sure I could go pretty far with you
To know the game, what to get fame, I can show you
You wanna be a claim, I can note your name so you can play too
Come on girl, come and get me, set yourself free
Come and play with me, come on girl
Come and get me, what d'you play for ? Come on girl, one 2 3 four
Come and get me, set yourself free, come and play with me, come on girl
Come and get me, what d'you play for ? Come on girl, one 2 3 four
Come on girl, come on girl
