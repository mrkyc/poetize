This is your fate, don't hesitate, give it to me, come give it to me
This is your fate, don't hesitate, give it to me, come give it to me
This is your fate, don't hesitate, give it to me, come give it to me
I'm not surprised of what I see, it would take more to surprise me
I just wanna see you dancing, give it to me, come give it to me
This is not about what's right or wrong, no reason to fight, it's just a song
This is all I got, this is not much
I would prove you that there's something I can do
I'll make you feel alright, yeah you gonna feel alright
That's how I want you to be, give it to me
You make me feel alright, then you hear me damn right
That's how I want you to be, give it to me
I'll make you feel alright, yeah you gonna feel alright
That's how I want you to be, give it to me
You make me feel alright, then you hear me damn right
That's how I want you to be, give it to me
Ooouhhhh!
I'm not afraid of who I am, matter of fact, I'm just a fan
Missy and Prince all around me, give it to me, come give it to me
You had enough prep, baby let it be, if you miss a step, well c'est la vie
Listen to the voice, it's not shaking
If I had a choice, I wouldn't change a thing
You might also likeI'll make you feel alright, yeah you gonna feel alright
That's how I want you to be, give it to me
You make me feel alright, then you hear me damn right

That's how I want you to be, give it to me
You make me feel alright, then you hear me damn right
That's how I want you to be, give it to me
