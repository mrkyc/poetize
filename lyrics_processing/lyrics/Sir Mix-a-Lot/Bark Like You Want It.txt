Big man is back, oh no, it's a brand new flow
Lettin' you Jakes and females know
Ain't a damn thing changed and I still got dough
Still gettin' watched by po-po
You know what a flow like, never grab a ol' mic
Never been down wit the slow life
Baby, I'm a low life, lookin' for the right type
To get it goin' on for the whole night
King of the backside, look at my rep
One of these West Coast vets
Known to lay bone and make miniskirts moan
Young hottie got me sittin' like stone
So, I'm at the Magic City
So many freaks in one spot, I'm dizzy
I'm a playa, so you know I wanna play
It ain't nothin' like the city Black-lanta, GA
Now, I start lookin' through the mist
Swangin' my game like this
What's up with the table poppin'?
Fine, 5'9", and I'm jockin'
But the girl won't dance
And I pitch me a tent, 'bout to wet my pants
She got body for days but the girl won't flaunt it

Bow wow, bow wow, give me my dog chow
Put me on a leash, or else I'm gonna have to snap now
Humpin' yo' leg, this doggy don't beg
Got a tight rubber cap on my head
So, check this game when I'm comin' through the hood
Swingin' 'round blocks but I don't sell goods
Mad brothas mean mug 'cause they wish they would
Get a fine thang like I could
You bought a six-four with the three-wheel mo'
Got no females in ya passenger door
You wanna playa hate 'cause you just don't know
'Bout the fast track makin' yo' ho go
Damn baby, why don't you let me ride with you? Here I go again
Done took yo' girl 'cause I don't like men
Got to the crib, romance don't phase me
Pulled to the house playin' (Freak me, baby)
Video check, one-two, one-two
Me and baby girl's 'bout to get loose
And just when I thought I could palm it
(You better drop to yo' knees and bark like you want it)
