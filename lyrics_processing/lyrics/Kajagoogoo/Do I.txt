Living on rhythm and circumstance
All washed up can't you see
That's your problem
Make a change in our hum-drum lives
To re-awake and realize
We're all living on a time bomb
That's gonna blow us to pieces
Pressure's on heart attack
Science fiction is science fact
Watch your back when the bullets fly
That's our problem
So do I, how do I, when do I do wrong
Take a look, take a look around town
Get get get along down
So do I, how do I, when do I do wrong
Hey hey hey yeah, no no no yeah
So do I, how do I, when do I do wrong
Sing it out, sing it sing it out loud
Come on, come on, come on, yeah now
Crazy peoples right to speak
Pushing and a-shoving on a one way street
That's enough I draw the line
Go to sleep for a long long time
Blinkers on straight ahead
Button my lip that's what I said
Listening, I can't justify
Oh, the pain in me I cry
