Feel free to look around with no obligation
Times have changed so break new ground
Feel free and take your time
Take a little extra time
More time with no obligations
Clothes in Vogue are all the rage
Ah! But don't expect too much
They can't perform miracles
Head to toe, disguised again
It's heavy when they say
We don't perform miracles, no!
We don't perform miracles

Be ah head start
Ooh to be ah, ooh to be ah
Look at me, ooh in something new
Ooh to be ah
Cool glossy mags reveal the facts
With a little bit of goo
It's usually in the Who's Who...
Place your bets
Predict the favourite party of the day
You'll find it in the Who's Who...
Who's there!?
You'll find them in the Who's Who...
