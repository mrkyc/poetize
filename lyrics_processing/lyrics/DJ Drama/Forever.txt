We will be here forever
Do you understand?
Forever
Forever and ever and ever and ever
Forever
You see, it's about the quality
It's about the streets
It's about the music (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)
Forever
DJ Drama (Oh-oh)
Y'all ready? (Cannon)

Oh, the life that we live, oh
Mmm, these streets are just everything we know (Yeah)
Stack and flip and stack again (Again)
Tell me what you know about it?
Oh, we have business fi mind (Fi mind)
Only worried 'bout what mine, ooh-woah
We gon' keep on stack and flip and stack again
Tell me what you know about it? (Loso)

The streets taught me valuable lessons
Like my best friends was a 40 Cal and a Wesson
Not these two face niggas tryna challenge my blessings
Talk down when you ain't 'round then smile in your presence
I'm a child of the essence so my morals is different
Took big steps to get here, my Euro was different
Check it, you play the game by the rules that's connected with it
It's not a win if you lost your respect to get it
Took a loss on my first trip to Broadway
Big hater, bad work, I guess I learned the hard way
Do my dirt by myself, handle my business (Facts)
I done seen a codefendant turn eye witness

Oh, the life that we live, oh

Stack and flip and stack again (Again)

Only worried 'bout what mine (Griselda, nigga), ooh-woah (Fuck you know about that, nigga? Big BSF)
We gon' keep on stack and flip and stack again
Tell me what you know about it? (The Butcher, The Butcher comin', nigga, yeah)

Throw me any number, my plug willin' to top it
So one phone call and the flood hittin' your project
I only wear them shits if a dub fit in the pockets
'Cause my hood brand more drug dealers than doctors (Gangsta)
Crack rock and jump shot, that's how my guys did it
So you either a Guy Fisher or Kawhi Leonard
I felt like both when I stacked my first five digits
Now I'm the coach who used to play, nigga, I'm Doc Rivers
Learn from the streets, be a student for the day
Disrespect when the team wait for you to run a play
Put a brick in your trap or a shooter on your face
Versace hangin' off my bitch like a Superwoman cape, ah

Oh, the life that we live, oh
Mmm, these streets are just everything we know (Yeah)
Stack and flip and stack again (Again)
Tell me what you know about it?
Oh, we have business fi mind (Fi mind)
Only worried 'bout what mine, ooh-woah
We gon' keep on stack and flip and stack again
Tell me what you know about it? (Jones)
Capo, what you know 'bout coffee grinders and that chalky china? (Woo)
And you can run but don't trip 'cause we gon' stalk and find you
And they'll stretch your boy, bless you, know the cross'll blind you
I'll drop a bag, it don't matter what it cost to line you
I got stains like it's spaghetti on my shirt (Hrr)
The first consignment that I got, Papi got deaded on the work (Fuck 'em)
And we was settin' up shop when grandma was gettin' off work
And I was watchin' Uncle Ricky and all that bread by the church (Facts)
Shit, I was out the window studyin' (Uh-huh)
I seen a four-five, had a grown man stutterin' (What you sayin'?)
Police was doin' raids, they had the helicopters hoverin' (Uh)
I was shootin' in Harlem when Pac was shootin' above the rim, nigga, I'm really like that

Oh, the life that we live, oh
Mmm, these streets are just everything we know (Yeah)
Stack and flip and stack again (Again)
Tell me what you know about it?
Oh, we have business fi mind (Fi mind)
Only worried 'bout what mine, ooh-woah
We gon' keep on stack and flip and stack again (Generation Now)
