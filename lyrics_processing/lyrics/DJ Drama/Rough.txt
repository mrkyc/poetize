Gangsta Gibbs, you ready, homie?
CTE World, nigga, let's go!

I said I solemnly swear I'd take my team to the top
You know Pyrex pots, you know they came with the top
And I just left the lot in a brand new drop
And I ain't pay for the roof cause me no like gettin' topped

I make it rough on you niggas, I make it rough on you hoes
Quarter brick in my pocket, I spent that shit on my clothes
You know it costs a few hundred, yeah you should see what I drove
Clip hold half a hundred, I bought that shit for my foes

I make it rough on you niggas, I make it rough on you hoes
I make it rough on you niggas, I make it rough on you hoes
I make it rough on you niggas, I make it rough on you hoes
And it hold half a hundred, I bought that shit for my foes

Malibu and Ciroc, I think I just lost my top
I think I just went crazy, I mean my chain too lazy
These niggas seldom made it, nah, Snow believe 'em
These niggas talk like they killas
Don't act like that when I see 'em
I call 'em out how I see 'em, my house look like a museum
You gotta be bullshittin' Snow, maybe a small collisuem
What kinda vest you got on? I think it Christian Dior
Got thirty K's in my closet, look like I'm ready for war
Brand new Glock out the box, scratch out the serial number
Then I pull up in the drop, like bitch just give me your number
With a meal, Louie V, eight hundred for sweats
Another 3 for the top, you know that bitch bounced my check
You might also like
I make it rough on you niggas, I make it rough on you hoes
Quarter brick in my pocket, I spent that shit on my clothes
You know it costs a few hundred, yeah you should see what I drove
Clip hold half a hundred, I bought that shit for my foes

I make it rough on you niggas, I make it rough on you hoes
I make it rough on you niggas, I make it rough on you hoes
I make it rough on you niggas, I make it rough on you hoes
And it hold half a hundred, I bought that shit for my foes

I make it rough on these niggas
Man, I make it rough on these hoes
Shot that Liu Kang to coopers
Still got that cutlass on 4s
And I put the bounce with the bunnies
'Cause they like the dust up they nose
Man, I straight Lewinsky these bitches
Get brain and bust on they clothes
Might be my last night
Got gas and shit for the glass pipe
Hop out, hit a nigga with the act right
Niggas rap but they ain't about that life, is that right?
You heard about them Gary niggas
That murder cap straight burry niggas
Got a chopper thang you better carry with ya
Don't come flex in my area, nigga
My boost phone twerk
Hit a lick, nigga, who got work?
Better go get duct tape
The nigga pump fake, his whole crew got burnt
And I crush his feelings
Copped that southern Cali condo when I killed him
Tryna to get my nigga Young to move out West and cop the building
I make it rough on you niggas, I make it rough on you hoes
Quarter brick in my pocket, I spent that shit on my clothes
You know it costs a few hundred, yeah you should see what I drove
Clip hold half a hundred, I bought that shit for my foes

I make it rough on you niggas, I make it rough on you hoes
I make it rough on you niggas, I make it rough on you hoes
I make it rough on you niggas, I make it rough on you hoes
