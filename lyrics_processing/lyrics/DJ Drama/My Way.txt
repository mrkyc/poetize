I guess you could say, "It's not easy"
I guess you could say, "You live and learn"
I want y'all to all 'em, "I paid my dues"
And when it's all said and done, I did it my way

Ohhhhhh
As the city lights up the night I feel soooo good 'cause I did it my way
And I knowwww that I'm just livin' the life of girls and gold
And I feel so good 'cause I did it my way

Nights bright like Vegas
The life of girls and gold is so contagious
I been cold
Took the C-O double M road
Hangin' out the windows
Reachin' for the world as the wind blows
The crescendo of my career loud in your ear, ear
I'm proud to be here, now that we here
This year, you could find me at The Cosmopolitan
Holdin' bottles, never bottled in
Prob'ly with Chicagoans
And there's black girls modellin', lookin' for a followin'
Attitude is tolerant, I'm married to the game like Solomon
These rings represent the dreams we got from the old folk
Yearnin' for The Gold Coast
My soul spoke things that was necessary
Found forever in ways that are legendary
And through the drama, I stuck to my commentary
Now that everyday man say that Comm is every-where

Ohhhhhh
As the city lights up the night I feel soooo good 'cause I did it my way
And I knowwww that I'm just livin' the life of girls and gold
And I feel so good 'cause I did it my way

I used to dream of risin' now I see it clearer
How surprising, I'm admiring that mirror
I'm inspiring the finer things in life
And your time is slowly expiring, you're crying me a river
That's ironic because she have a river as well
I like to swim in it like Olympians, Y-S-L
And some Timberlands, high as hell
A ceilin' is an understatement, I burn through it, prove it's a fire drill
Fire hoes, bad bitches fire hoes
Fire then re-hire hoes
Her entire crew is tired of the liars that you runnin by her
I can see you, hoe
Plenty priors of a fuck nigga, nigga, I suppose
I can fly her, put her in attire of designer clothes
Dayton wires on the Chevy, why are you not tolerable?
Don't you know they already fuck me, I'm a made man
Maids in the mansion, clean 'em up out here

Ohhhhhh
As the city lights up the night I feel soooo good 'cause I did it my way
And I knowwww that I'm just livin' the life of girls and gold
And I feel so good 'cause I did it my way
