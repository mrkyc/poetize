It's goin' down tonight, baby
Haha, yeah
DJ Drama!

I got sand all by my bath water, candles by my wine glass
Women all on my time, imagine how my time pass
They say them freaks come out at night, and you know who they came to see
Even though she ain't mine, I fucked her like her man to be

So many girls in here tonight
So many girls in here tonight
I'm just lookin' for the right one, exotic as they might come
Better leave with two 'cause really I don't like one
So many girls in here tonight

Ah! Light skin, dark skin, sit your fine ass right there
Come join at my table and don't question when tonight end
Toss a couple dollars and she down for whatever
Don't make no promises but promise I could fuck you better
Fuck that singin' shit, I be the shit, that Y-M, too legit to quit
You thinkin' that you better then that Venus and Serena shit
I'm all up up in my latest chick, she sayin' this that greatest dick
I one-two stroke her, we caught up in the moment, aye
T-t-turn up, V-12 and I burn up
My chick that fly bitch and your bitch unheard of
4 AM and we still poppin' bottles
Prolly have a new chick tomorrow 'cause there's so many

(Yeah, Wale though, Double M Genius.. yeah)
I put my problems in this pitcher, got a bucket full of liquor
And I know ya'll got that bad bitch but y'all got way too many niggas
What's your phone numb', Tyga got some roll up
Loud pack wit'cho bad ass 'cause these good girls just ain't no fun
Double cup and I'm slowed up, smokin' dub with my chauffeur
Sneaka fly, hitta stylin', I'm the reason why you nigga's foamed up
New York and my slow bucks, DC got that old cup
Hold up, these nigga's want no bucks
Straight shot sipper, I ain't mixin' my liquor
Bitch, I'm not kiddin', ya'll some Fisher-Price niggas
And we some life livers hopin' that this life give us
A lot of money, success, and a woman to ride wit' us
Ambition (Ralph, Genius)
