Dear Lord (Hee hee)
When it's all said and done (Oh)
I pray I'm forgiven for my wrongs (Oh)
And when they tell the story, it ends righteously (Ooh yeah)

Uh, sorry Your Honor if I was too arrogant
That money was staggering
They locked me PC with them trannies and rats
Man that shit was embarrassing
Twenty-three hours in a cell by myself
Man you couldn't imagine it
They fed me some shit I wouldn't feed to my dog
Man that shit was the nastiest
Can you imagine me losing my mind?
Doing push-ups, fifty-two at a time
Do the whole deck just to get through the time
Just to get to my son and get back to my mom
Cause Papi keep asking me where am I at?
I told him, "In jail" and I said I'd be back
He said "When you're back, can you get me from school?"
Shit like that there'll turn a boy to a goon
Onto the graveyard, there's only one stop
We live fast, die from gunshots
In this lifestyle where we sling dope, bust Glocks
Why you think we say, "Fuck cops?"
Cause when they lock us up, all the funds stop
And when the ice cream truck come to one stops
So for the little babies, all the fun stop!
And we post on the corner like the bus stop
Waiting on the state bus 'til the cuffs lock
They put shackles on us like jewelry, we say, "Fuck rock"
Cause all we ever wanted was to sell block
To get a little real estate to sell blocks
Until we got a little taste of cell blocks
And try telling God when these cells lock, have mercy on me
Touchdown, catch your case tryna sell rock
You ain't wanna believe that hell's hot
My mom, she told me "You might as well stop
Cause you can't ride your wave when the wells dry
And your water's off and your bill's due
And your shit stinks, smell like mildew
Shit got wet all up and then left there
Cause them little niggas done killed you", goddamn

I know you're watching over me (Over me, yeah)
But the devil's tryna take my soul (My soul)
One day, all my niggas be free (Oh)
I know you got your hand on me (Hand on me, hand on me)
Cause the devil's tryna take my soul (My soul)
One day, all my niggas be free, ooh-wee

They gave my dawg life and I talked to him yesterday
Talk to him every day
He called me, he told me he living through me
Nigga, homie, don't ever say
I told him I got him, new lawyers and everything
100K on the heavyweight
Cause it don't mean nothing, spent that on a presi' face
He took the charge and ain't ever say
What we was doing or how we was moving
I'm talking that life, every night we was shooting
Selling narcotics and ducking narcotics
I duck in the alley, I do it elusive
I could remember my momma in tears
Me and my sister, no father was there
Oodles and Noodles turned me to a monster
Now I'm screaming "Momma, I got us this year", ho!
And every year after, now every day's laughter
No jail visits, no collect calls, we done put an end to that chapter
On holiday, small island, riding jet skis with the family
I'm a hood nigga, I can't swim
But that little fact, it ain't stopping me
I got yacht dreams, not rented, I double parks in that harbor
That's drag racing for rich niggas and bad bitches at the cargo
Woo! How fast your car go? Mine go two and change
My drugs now got a barcode, now that's called moving things
Sing!

I know you're watching over me (Watching over me)
But the devil's tryna take my soul (My soul)
One day, all my niggas be free (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
I know you got your hand on me (Hand on me)
Cause the devil's tryna take my soul (My soul)
One day, all my niggas be free (Ooh yeah)

See we don't choose the life we're given (Hee hee)
But just make the best out of what we're living (Oh)
Circumstance don't define you (Oh) your choices do
You know what your biggest blessing is? (Ooh yeah)
Tomorrow (Over me, yeah)
Cause the devil's tryna take my soul (My soul)
