You see I been waiting, waiting on that time
Feel me if you been waiting on yours
That moment, is close (Yeah)

Tired of living day to day like everything is alright
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment (Yeah, 2 Chainz!)
Been waiting on my

Old dude met mom, it was on
Then he named me over a phone, prison term
Live and learn, sippin' syrup with my vision blurred
Take this cup of reality, niggas finna err
When you start from the bottom, you can see the top
So when you get to it, don't let 'em see the spot
Next thing you know, you lookin' for a rent sign
Upper echelon, bitch we skip line
I remember reminiscing in the kitchen like
"I wonder when the Braves gon' win it
I wonder when the Falcons gon' get here"
Pyrex vison, made more than I ever made with DTP this year (Oh!)

Tired of livin' day to day like everything's alright
And every night, just one thing on my mind
I'm just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
You say, "Oh you got that aw shit? Hell nah", next time, that's mine (That's mine)
As long as I stay hustling, I'm gon' shine
I'm just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment (Oh, oh, oh)

Just waiting on my moment, bad hoes I'm shonin'
Time came and I owned it just like 'Bron James and start ballin'
When I touched the rock and I cracked the block
When I pulled up in that muscle drop
With that roof off and my shoes off on y'all bitch niggas, RuPaul
Real nigga in my hood who everybody gon' root for
Cause they see me come from that bottom (Bottom)
Where everybody get bodied (Bodied)
They told me get 'em, I got 'em, now I'm here nigga like yeah nigga
Just Rolls Royce and Bugattis and M4s this year nigga
If I don't grind, I don't shine, if I don't shine, then I don't eat (Eat)
If I don't eat then I'ma starve, if I'ma starve, I pull heat (Heat)
On all y'all bitch ass niggas, all y'all rich ass niggas
Cause if I don't make no money, nigga
I'm gon' take yo' money, nigga (Oh!)

Tired of livin' day to day like everything's alright
And every night, just one thing on my mind
I'm just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
You say, "Oh you got that aw shit? Hell nah", next time, that's mine (That's mine)
As long as I stay hustling, I'm gon' shine
I'm just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment (Oh, oh, oh)
Since life ain't promised tomorrow, live it up, live it up, live it up!
Careful to come this far, give it up, give it up, give it up!
Oh no, I won't, give it up, give it up, give it up!
Until I have it all, yeah!

Tired of livin' day to day like everything's alright
And every night, just one thing on my mind
I'm just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
You say, "Oh you got that aw shit? Hell nah", next time that's mine (That's mine)
As long as I stay hustling, I'm gon' shine
I'm just waiting on that moment (DJ Drama!)
