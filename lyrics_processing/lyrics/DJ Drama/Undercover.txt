Baby, I won't tell if you won't tell
I mean, we could keep it on the hush-hush
Let me show you

I ain't gonna lie
I'm fiendin' 'cause I need it and I'm diggin' you a lot
Now you still catchin' feelings, but I'm feelin' all your spots
No kiddin' when I hit it, I'll be lickin' on your spine
Playin' with your mind
I ain't gonna stop
When I finish, I be in it
I be fuckin' with the lights on, that's the shit that I'm on
Give it all I got
Your body and my body
We be foolin', scratchin', screamin' now

Hey, shawty, where we going? (Ayy)
Nobody has to know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover (Yeah), cover, cover (Yeah), cover

Nobody has to know but you

One thing you should know about me is I never play to lose, huh
Always aim high and rarely obey the rules
Never tell my business, if I did, it'd make the news
They say, "Time is like money," you should come here, pay your dues
And come kick it, can I get a minute? Maybe a hour, huh
Would you let me peak my head in for a second while you shower? Huh
I bet you got some real good power, if you feel me
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, you know just what's gon' heal me, baby

Hey, shawty, where we going? (Ayy)
Nobody has to know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover (Yeah), cover, cover (Yeah), cover

I said, "Excuse me, Mrs. Officer
Can you go undercover for me?"
Ain't enough liquor in your cup
If the waitress here, then let her pour it up
I'm tryna get you drunk as fuck
Take her to my crib, then I lock her in them handcuffs
Panties off, stupid booty
Ready for war, Call of Duty
She said I got the right to remain silent
And I got to give it to her rough, but I better not get violent, ha
Girl, my chain feel like a anchor
And when I told you to use your head, I ain't want you to be no thinker
And we ain't gon' waste this drink up, these haters sore like cankles
While I'm countin' all this paper and my ears shine like twinkle, twinkle, ha
Big star, get my car, I don't valet that
You a weak nigga, pussy in the street, call you a alleycat
And I'm loyal to my fans 'cause I love 'em
So, girl, if you're a fan, you can meet me undercovers like
Hey, shawty, where we going? (Ayy)
Nobody has to know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover (Yeah), cover, cover (Yeah), cover
Hey, shawty, where we going? (Ayy)
Nobody has to know but you
Ain't nobody gon' see you
Undercover (Yeah), cover, cover (Yeah), cover
