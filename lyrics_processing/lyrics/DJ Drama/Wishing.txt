I ain't like them other niggas, you see that I'm different
I creep on the late night, I stay on the missions
Got all types of different bitches
Pussy wet and drippin', I feel like sippin'
I eat the pussy with precision
Six rings, Jordan, Pippen
I do gymnastics with a brick and flip it
Money to the ceilin', no, I ain't trippin'
No conversation
These niggas bitches be textin' and sendin' emojis
But no, I don't say shit
He try to hang with the homies but tell on the gang
Boy, you a straight bitch
And now your girl comin' over, give me that booty
Know it's amazin', lovin' these bitches
Got into trouble with bitches, can't fuck with these bitches

Baby, you know who I am
And, girl, I know just who you are (Hol' up)
We ain't gotta rush into shit
'Cause bein' in love is too hard (Hol' up)
I'm tired of all these flashin' lights
Girl, we should just fuck in the dark
Once you let me in it
I'ma get to switchin', different positions
Have that ass wishin' that I was your nigga (Ooh, woah)
Wishin' that I was your nigga, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wishin' that I was your nigga, yeah
Once you let me in it
I'ma get to switchin', different positions
Have that ass wishin' that I was your nigga (Show me)
