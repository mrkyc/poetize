Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it (Mike WILL Made-It)

A bitch gon' be a bitch, a ho gon' be a ho
A killer gon' be a killer, that's something you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gon' be a dealer, a plug gon' be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, we just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it

I had a young hot thang, fucked my bro and gave 'em brain
And she expect for me to love her, I can never be a lame
I'm attracted to her sexually, but she ain't my main dame
We can be the best of friends, shawty, but you off the chain
See I ain't gonna hold it against ya, I'ma keep it pimping with ya
Don't you come at me with issues, ain't tryna get all in your mixture
I ain't tryna come to get ya, you can meet me somewhere on Peachtree
At the W on the 14th, ain't tryna fuck no ho tryna know me
And they wanna fuck my woadie, already smashed the homie
Half of these bitches phony, singing love songs like Toni
Ms. Braxton, you the action, stop acting
Just another sad love song waiting to happen

A bitch gon' be a bitch, a ho gon' be a ho
A killer gon' be a killer, that's something you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gon' be a dealer, a plug gon' be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, we just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it

A killer gonna be a killer, that's regardless
Of the fact that I'm Tin Man heartless
No love for ya, baby, 'less you walkin' through my livin' room braless
With your nipples pokin' through ya wife beater, you the mic eater
She doing Daddy Fat Staxxx soon as I meet her
Get it, meet her
Cut to the chase like a cheetah 'cause she want that PETA
Pipe her down, gon' wipe her clown
When so many niggas un-wiped her down
You hopin' that she gonna turn her life around
Up out face, a full 180
A ho into a housewife, that's your lady
And me? I never give her nothing but a dope baby
With a good time and a dope dick
She love the way I talk and my flow slick
Ain't no way around it
Yo-yo-yo-yo-your bitch in love with my dick
But Big don't love her at all
Let a monkey nigga pay the bills while I scrub them jaws
Like a test for DNA, TNA, we the A
A bitch gon' be a bitch, a ho gon' be a ho
A killer gon' be a killer, that's something you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gon' be a dealer, a plug gon' be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, we just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it

Ball so hard need Ace of Spades
Livin' life through these Ray Bans
Drop four, whipped up eight man
How you do that? Got great hands
I ain't seeing you niggas like Ray Charles
Figure how I'ma drive these eight cars
Tryna figure how I'ma fuck these eight hoes
Same time increase my bankroll
Broke shit had my vision blurred
So I went and copped me a quarter bird
Got me a job, got work to do
Need a job, nigga, got work for you
Hood lil' niggas die by respect
Niggas bleeding what they readin' on the internet
Where ya from, nigga? Where ya plug?
Just like I thought, niggas cyber thugs
That is a job fuck niggas hate
Why you think I'm carrying this 7H?
Twenty-two rounds that'll keep me straight
If I ain't got that then I make and bake
Been gettin' money since Bathing Ape
Red monkey, I'm a watch junkie
Ain't no way really 'round that
Made them young niggas screaming, "Where them pounds at?"
What
A bitch gon' be a bitch, a ho gon' be a ho
A killer gon' be a killer, that's something you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gon' be a dealer, a plug gon' be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, we just like blood
