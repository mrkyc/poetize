She had never done before
She was in the bed with another man
Made Freddie's pallet on the floor
He got mad, he got bad
Come with his gun in his hand
Freddie's woman saw him coming
Went and fell down on her knees
I can hear her cryin' now: "Freddie
Spare my life if you please
I know you're mad, you got bad
And with a gun in your hand!'
Freddie meets the policeman
With his big gun in his hand
"Fred, I heard you done killed your woman."
He said: "Yes, I'm looking for that man
He made me mad, I got bad
With my gun in my hand"
Freddie said: "Look-a-here ]udge
Judge wouldn't you have got mad
You'd a-come home and found your woman
With another man in your bed
You'd got mad, You'd got bad
Took your gun in your hand."

Mama you have to let me go
Cause the woman's mistreated me
And I had to shoot her so
You'd got mad, I got bad
With my gun in my hand."
Now Freddie say he laid down
Tried not to pay no mind
But a while befo' day
Freddie was woke, heard some stranger
He got mad, he got bad
He put his gun in his hand
"Freddie!" Papa told Freddie
"Son, here where you done wrong
When you saw that that woman wasn't treatin' you
Son, why didn't you let her alone?
You got mad, you got bad
With your gun in your hand."
Freddie said: "Look-a-here Papa
Papa, wouldn't you got mad
You'da come home and found Mama
With another man in your bed
You'd got mad, you'd got bad
With your gun in your hand!'
Freddie's Papa said: "Yes
Son, I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do
If the judge give you forty years
I'll have em pardon you
For being bad, mad
