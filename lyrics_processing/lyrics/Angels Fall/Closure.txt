Ever since you let me go
Gone without a reason
Guess I'll never really know why
You said goodbye
Tryin' not look back
But I can't help myself
After all that we had
Forever's sitting on a shelf
And I, I just wanna know why
And I keep
Crashin' down, caving in
Pull myself back again
There's always a part of me missin'
Look at the mess that you made out of me
Shattered like glass, broken memories
Now that you're gone
I keep on fallin' apart
Over and over I'm
Catchin' my breath, learning how to breathe
Swallow my pain, so no one can see
I'm such a wreck
What's the point in me moving on
Without any closure
You might also likeLost in a breakdown
Wanna be me again
Lookin' for a way out
Knowin' that I'm innocent
But I, blame it all on me every time, every time
Crashin' down, cavin' in
Pull myself back again
There's always a part of me missin'
Look at the mess that you made out of me
Shattered like glass, broken memories
Now that you're gone
I keep on fallin' apart
Over and over I'm
Catchin' my breath, learning how to breathe
Swallow my pain, so no one can see
That I'm such a wreck
What's the point in me moving on
Without any closure
Hope you see what you've done to me
I just want you to know (want you to know)
Hanging on to the memories
When all I wanna do is let go
Look at the mess that you made out of me
Shattered like glass, broken memories
Now that you're gone
I keep on fallin' apart
Over and over I'm
Catchin' my breath, learning how to breathe
Swallow my pain, so no one can see
I'm such a wreck
What's the point in me moving on
Without any closure, yeah
Without any closure
Without any closure
