I couldn't tell you I'm sorry
I couldn't get the words out right
I had every chance to keep you by my side
Now I'm empty, like this bottle
Like this house is gonna be
I'm packing your suitcase
Now I can see what's right in front of me

And I'm just drunk enough to tell you
Exactly what I needed to say
I'm just drunk enough to tell you
"I need you, please stay"
'Cause I'm sober enough to know
Maybe it's a little too late
'Cause I'm sober enough to see you
Walking away (walking away)

I had a moment of weakness
I hope that you can somehow find
Some forgiveness inside of you in time
I should have held you closer
I should have been there more
I was stupid, I regret it
'Cause now you're walking out the door
You might also like
And I'm just, drunk enough to tell you
Exactly what I needed to say
I'm just, drunk enough to tell you
I need you, please stay
'Cause I'm sober enough to know
Maybe it's a little too late
'Cause I'm sober enough to see you
Walking away

Now, I'm sorry
I never meant to treat you this way
You're so beautiful
And I wasted every chance you gave me
If I could take it all back you know I would
But, I guess I'm too late
Now I'm empty, like this bottle
Like this house is gonna be

And I'm just, drunk enough to tell you
Exactly what I needed to say
I'm just, drunk enough to tell you
I need you, please stay
'Cause I'm sober enough to know
Maybe it's a little too late
'Cause I'm sober enough to see you
Walking away
(I'm drunk enough to tell you)
(Exactly what I needed to say)
Walking away
(I'm drunk enough to tell you)
(Exactly what I needed to say)
Walking away
(I'm drunk enough to tell you)
(Exactly what I needed to say)
'Cause I'm sober enough to see you
