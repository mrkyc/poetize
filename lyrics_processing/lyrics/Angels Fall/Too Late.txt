And you're staring at me
Like I should know what to say
But I'm just as lost as you
So we toss and we turn
Through another long night
Like we're waiting for the fever to break
But I'm just as scared as you
We can't stop but we both know
It should have ended a long time ago
So I'm letting go
It's just too late to save
It's too late to try
We're just too far away
It used to be so right
I've got something to say to you
Afraid to look into your eyes
Here come the tears
Here come the fears
Here comes goodbye
Here comes goodbye
You might also likeWe could try to hang on
To the good memories
But they're few and far between
We've lost all there is to lose
Should we lie to ourselves
Try to get someone else
Just for the sake of not being alone
Or is it time to face the truth
We can't stop but we both know
It should have ended a long time ago
It's just too late to save
It's too late to try
We're just too far away
It used to be so right
I've got something to say to you
Afraid to look into your eyes
Here come the tears
Here come the fears
Here comes goodbye
Here comes the hardest thing
I've ever had to do
Here comes the part where I
Where I let go of you
It's too late to save
It's too late to try
We're too far away
It used to be so right
I got something to say to you
Afraid to look into your eyes
Here come the tears
Here come the fears
Here comes goodbye
Here come the tears
There go the years
Here comes goodbye
