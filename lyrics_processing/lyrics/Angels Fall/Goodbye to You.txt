You're breaking my heart
Let me go so I can move on from this
I'm tired of being alone
I'm not afraid so don't you say that
I can't make it on my own
Cause by the way
You are the reason I couldn't
Fly on my own
And at sunrise I'll be gone
And you won't know were I've gone
I have to moved on from
All this pain and all this loneliness
That you made for me
Goodbye too you
All the tears and all the fears
The sleepless nights all the head games
Goodbye to you
I wish you well but I can tell
That you don't want the same for me
So goodbye to you
I found my way I love this place
Best of all you are far away
So goodbye to you
You might also likeYou're afraid to be alone, and you claim
I broke your heart
Well It was the same
For me and I know it was so hard
And now you say you need me back
It's kind of late to change your heart
Well
I've got to say
There's nothing you could do
To make me want to start
And at sunrise I'll be gone
And you won't know were I've gone
I have to moved on from
All this pain and all this loneliness
That you made for me
Goodbye too you
All the tears and all the fears
The sleepless nights all the head games
Goodbye to you
I wish you well but I can tell
That you don't want the same for me
So goodbye to you
I found my way I love this place
Best of all you are far away
So goodbye to you
All by myself
I will start this new life
All by myself
I will make it all right
All by myself
I don't need you in my life
All by myself
I will make it through
I will make it through
I will make it through
All this pain and all this loneliness
That you made for me
Goodbye too you
All the tears and all the fears
The sleepless nights all the head games
Goodbye to you
I wish you well but I can tell
That you don't want the same for me
So goodbye to you
I Found my way I love this place
Best of all you are far away
