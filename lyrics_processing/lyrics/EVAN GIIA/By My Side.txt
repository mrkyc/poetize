Can we go back to before this started
Dreamin' about all the things we wanted
City big but our world was small
Drank it up 'till our belly's full

Now I'm feeling lost in a foreign land
Without you here and now in both my hands
I got the keys
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

I think I need you by my side, side
Think I need you, think I need you
I think I need you by my side, side
Thank god for you, thank god for you
Think I need you in my life, life
Really I do, really I do
'Cuz nothing feels the same
Yeah, nothing feels the same
I think I need you by my side, side
Think I need you, think I need you
I think I need you by my side, side
Thank god for you, thank god for you
Think I need you in my life, life
Really I do, really I do
'Cuz nothing feels the same
Yeah, nothing feels the same
You might also like
Remember how it all worked so simply
Back before we all got so busy
End our days and we'd fall in bed
Now we're planning six weeks ahead

And I feel like a thought in a foreign tongue
Tryna plan alone a moment with those I love
I got the keys
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

I think I need you by my side, side
Think I need you, think I need you
I think I need you by my side, side
Thank god for you, thank god for you
Think I need you in my life, life
Really I do, really I do
'Cuz nothing feels the same
Yeah, nothing feels the same
I think I need you by my side, side
Think I need you, think I need you
I think I need you by my side, side
Thank god for you, thank god for you
Think I need you in my life, life
Really I do, really I do
'Cuz nothing feels the same
