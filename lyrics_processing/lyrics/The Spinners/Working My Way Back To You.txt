I'll keep working my way back to you, babe
With a burning love inside
Yeah, I'm working my way back to you, babe
And the happiness that died
I let it get away (Do-do, do-do-do)
Been payin' every day (Do-do, do-do-do)
When you were so in love with me
I played around like I was free
Thought I could have my cake and eat it, too
But how I cried over losing you
See, I'm down and out
But I ain't about to go living my life without you
Hey, every day I made you cry
I'm paying, girl, till the day I die
I'll keep working my way back to you, babe
With a burning love inside
Yeah, I'm working my way back to you, babe
And the happiness that died
I let it get away (Do-do, do-do-do)
Been payin' every day (Do-do, do-do-do)
