Love just ain't right
Love just ain't right
Love just ain't right
Love just ain't right

Think of the day I first gave you love
You said love comes from God above
You told me lies that I thought were true
How I loved being hooked on you
But where are you now?
I'm wearing a frown, what love can do
The thought of your name
Surrounds me with pain but I'll be true

I must be living for a broken heart
No matter what you're doing
I must be living for a broken heart
No matter what you're doing
Oh honey, love just ain't right
Love just ain't right
You might also like
I am the man that you said I'd be
Why have you turned your back on me?
Maybe it's time that we weigh the lost
Share the pain and just pay the cost
So where are you now?
I'm wearing a frown, what love can do
The thought of your name
Surrounds me with pain but I'll be true

(And ooh...)
I must be living for a broken heart
No matter what you're doing
I must be living for a broken heart
No matter what you're doing
Love just ain't right
Love just ain't right
I must be living for a broken heart
No matter what you're doing
I must be living for a broken heart
No matter what you're doing
(I'm gonna say it one more time, baby)
I must be living for a broken heart
No matter what you're doing
I must be living for a broken heart
No matter what you're doing
I must be living for a broken heart
No matter what you're doing
I must be living for a broken heart
No matter what you're doing
I must be living for a broken heart
No matter what you're doing
I must be living for a broken heart
No matter what you're doing
I must be living for a broken heart
No matter what you're doing
I must be living for a broken heart
No matter what you're doing
I must be living for a broken heart
No matter what you're doing
I must be living for a broken heart
