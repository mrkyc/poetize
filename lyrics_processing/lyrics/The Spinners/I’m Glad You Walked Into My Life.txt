Another year has come and gone
I thought I had to make it all alone
It's been so long but God above
Gave me the strength to find someone to love

So girl I'm kind of glad
You walked into my life
I finally found love
Though I had to sacrifice
I'm truly glad to know you
Baby, soon you'll wanna go
Hey but now
I'm king on a throne, whoa
Girl, I'm kind of glad (So glad)
You walked into my life (Pretty little angel you)
I finally found love (Yes, sir)
Though I had to sacrifice
I'm truly glad to know you
Baby, soon you'll wanna go
Hey but right now right now right now
I'm king on a throne

Once knew a girl who broke my heart
Ten-thousand love affairs I played the part
Come rain or shine I'll never be
The fool I was until your love found me
You might also like
So girl I'm kind of glad
You walked into my life
I finally found love
Though I had to pay the price
Girl, I'm truly, truly glad to know you
Maybe soon you'll want to go
Whoa but right now I said I'm king on a throne
Give me my crown, hey
Girl, I'm kind of glad (Well, well, well, well, well)
You walked into my life (Oh)
I finally found love (I found)
Though I had to pay the price
I'm truly glad, truly glad to know you
Maybe soon you'll want to go
Oh, but right now yeah I'm king on a throne
I don't wanna be left alone
Girl, I'm kind of glad (Baby, I'm glad, I'm glad)
You walked into my life (Yeah)
I finally found love (I finally found someone)
Though I had to pay the price (Though I had to sacrifice)
And I'm truly glad to know you
Maybe soon you'll wanna go
Oh, but right now
I'm king on a throne, oh
Girl I'm kind of glad (Yes, sir)
You walked into my life (Pretty little thing, pretty little thing)
I finally found love (Yeah)
Though I had to pay the price
Girl, I'm truly glad to know you
Maybe soon you'll wanna go
But little girl, little girl right now
