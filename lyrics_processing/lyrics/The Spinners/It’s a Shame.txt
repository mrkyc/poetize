It's a shame the way you mess around with your man
It's a shame the way you hurt me
It's a shame the way you mess around with your man
I'm sitting all alone by the telephone
Waiting for your call, when you don't call at all

It's a shame (Shame) the way you mess around with your man
It's a shame (Shame) the way you play with my emotions
It's a shame (Shame) the way you mess around with your man
You're like a child at play on a sunny day
'Cause you play with love and then you throw it away

Why do you use me, try to confuse me?
How can you stand to be so cruel?
Why don't you free me from this prison?
Where I serve my time as your fool

It's a shame (Shame) the way you mess around with your man
It's a shame (Shame) the way you hurt me
It's a shame (Shame) the way you mess around with your man
I try to stay with you, show you love so true
But you won't appreciate the love we try to make
You might also like
Oh, it's got to be a shame

Why do you use me, try to confuse me?
How can you stand to be so cruel?
Why don't you free me from this prison?
I've served my time as your fool

Got to be a shame (Shame) the way you mess around with your man
Oh, it's a shame (Shame) the way you hurt me
Oh, it's a shame, baby, baby (Shame), the way you mess around with your man
You've got my heart in chains and I must complain
I just can't be confined, oh, looking back in time
Oh (Shame)
It's a shame, it's a shame (Shame), the way you've hurt me, yeah
Ow (Shame), got to, got to, got to, got to, be a shame, oh yeah
