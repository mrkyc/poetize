The kind of love that you read about in a fairy tale
Like the sun that shines on a rainy day, it's a cloud of love
One of a kind love affair is
When your down is up, when your up is down
But love stays around
And when you know you're right, but you got to make a little sacrifice
You make it for love. Who-oh-oh-oh, yeah
I never thought about today would come
When she would leave without good-bye, yes, sir
She wrote a line or two upon the wall --
Said, I'm leaving you, know I love you too
I can't stay with you --
And this very day, I could never say a discouraging word
?Cause I love you. Who-oh-oh-oh, yes, siree, now
(One of a kind) love affair is
When you hate to say girl I told you so, but you gotta go
There won't be a fight, ?cause your love is right
But you're leaving wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
(One of a kind) Ooh (love affair is) Ooh yeah
When you treat her nice but you finally have to pay the price
And though you know you're right
But you got to make a little sacrifice
You make it for love
You make it for love. Yeah-heh-heh-heh
