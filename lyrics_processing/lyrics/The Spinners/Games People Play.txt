Can't get no rest
Don't know how I work all day
When will I learn?
Memories get in the way
I walk around
I can't hear a sound, folks talkin' loud, but I
Don't see at all
I gotta get away, gotta get away, I don't
:
Know where to go
It's hopeless so
I guess I'll leave it alone
:
Well I
Spent all my day
Fixin' up to go somewhere
Thought I was late
And I found she wasn't there
I guess I'll find
The love, peace of mind, some other time, but I
Still have today
I gotta get away, gotta get away, I don't

Right, wrong, I just can't stop it
Spendin' all day
Thinking just of you

Could see her face

Smile as she came, callin' out my name, so I

Know where to go
We'll take it slow
Guess I'll call it a day
