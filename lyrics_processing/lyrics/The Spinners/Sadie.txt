In a world like today
It's a rare occasion to be able to see young mothers
Like the ones that were around when I grew up
But they live on in memory to quite a few of us
And this song is dedicated to those who cherish that memory

Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to eat
She said to me
"Boy, hurry to Sunday school"
Filled with her load of glory
We learned the holy story
She'll always have her dreams
Despite the things
This troubled world can bring

Oh, Sadie
Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?
Place no one above you, sweet Sadie (Well, well, well)
(Living in the past)
Sometimes it seems so funny
But no money will turn your life around
You might also like
Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papa's old brandy
Always that needed smile
Once in a while
She would break down and cry
Sometimes she'd be so happy
Just being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds
With just a simple song

Oh, Sadie Mae
(Sadie)
(Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?)
She's lovin' us all in a special way
Well, well, well
(Place no one above you, sweet Sadie)
Sweet Sadie, livin' in the past (Living in the past)
Oh, she's never sinnin'
In love, she's always winnin', yeah
(Sadie)
My, my, my, my, my
(Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?)
I love you, mama
(Place no one above you, sweet Sadie)
I just can't forget how you gave me love, oh, Lord
(Living in the past)
If there's a heaven up above
I know she's teaching angels how to love
(Sadie)
It's a mean world without you
(Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?)
All the love you showed
(Place no one above you, sweet Sadie)
Oh, how could anyone ever doubt your lovely word?
(Living in the past)
Ain't it funny that in the end, it's not money?
It's just the love you gave us all
(Sadie)
Why, why do the good leave so soon?
(Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?)
(Place no one above you, sweet Sadie)
Oh, I don't know
(Living in the past)
And though the people say they love my songs
Oh Lord, I'm all alone, I miss her so
(Sadie)
Well
(Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?)
I love you, mama
(Place no one above you, sweet Sadie)
Oh, let me just try, just try one more time and say, I
(Living in the past)
And though we were very poor, she tried to love us that much more, oh
(Sadie)
Have you ever, have you ever met Sadie?
(Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?)
(Place no one above you, sweet Sadie)
Oh, the premier of ladies
(Living in the past)
Oh, sometimes I feel so alone
But I know that I gotta on
(Sadie)
That's what she wanted for me
(Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?)
I know it's gonna be hard sometimes
(Place no one above you, sweet Sadie)
Oh, Sadie
(Living in the past)
Lord, although my mama's no longer here
Her memory still lingers dear, ah
Just let me run, let me run, let me go (Sadie)
(Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?)
Oh, don't you? Why you wanna make me feel so bad?
(Place no one above you, sweet Sadie)
Well, well, this feeling won't let me be (Living in the past)
