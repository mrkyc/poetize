Catch a star if you can, wish for something special!
Let it be me, my love is free
Sing a song to yourself, think of someone listenin'
One melody you wrote for me

I'll write a symphony just for you and me
If you let me love you
I'll paint a masterpiece just for you to see
If you let me love you, let me love you

Are you (Are you ready), yeah
(Are you ready for love) Yes, I am, are you, baby
(Are you ready) Tell me, yeah
(Are you ready for love) Yes, I am, are you
Are you ready
Are you ready for love, love

You're the one like the sun, shine your love around me
You'll always be the one for me
Say the word, I'll be there, loving you forever
Don't let me go, just say it's so

To the valley below us
And we'll serenade the world with a lullaby
So the angels will know us, angels will know us

Are you (Are you ready), tell me, yeah
(Are you ready for love) Yes, I am, are you, baby
(Are you ready) Tell me
(Are you ready for love) Oh, are you
(Are you ready) Ready
(Are you ready for love) Love

Most of the times I think about how good love feels to me
It makes me feel like I wanna moan, yeah!

(Are you ready) Are you ready
(Are you ready for love) Hey, yes, I am, hey, tell me
(Are you ready) Are you
(Are you ready for love) You know it's known all over the world
(Are you ready) Everybody's
(Are you ready for love) Waiting on love
And I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin' if you will stand up
(Are you ready) And let the world know
(Are you ready for love) Hey, hey
(Are you ready) Forgot to tell you
(Are you ready for love) Whoa, over in England
(Are you ready) Northern town gettin' down, y'all
(Are you ready for love) Hey, oh, no, Tokyo, yeah
