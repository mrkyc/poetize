I hope y'all don't mind if I, uh
Can I tell ya a little story?
See, I was lying in bed
And I had a strange feeling come over me
And I-I tried to fight it
But I just couldn't keep control
I had a feeling that somewhere
There was a party going on
And then funky music starting floating through the air
And the feeling kept getting stronger
And I got out of my bed
And put on my clothes and dancing shows
'Cause I found out
Lying in bed by myself
That it just wasn't any use
I wonder if any of y'all know what I'm talking about
You see, the little wheels started turning
And landed in my soul
A fire started burning
Ooh good Lord, looks good to me
I went down to the disco
And the whole joint was jumping
You should have seen what I saw
Out in the middle of the floor
I saw a Joe Tex with a big fat lady
They were bumping
And I tell ya, Joe didn't mind
The way the woman kept knockin' him down
'Cause every time he would fall
He would pick himself up off the floor
Dust off his clothes and go another round, yeah
Oh Lord, makes me wanna
Makes me feel like I wanna get down
And then all of a sudden
I heard somebody
Say they felt like they wanted to do a slow dance
And then somebody said, "Oh no, don't play a slow record
'Cause I feel like I wanna party"
I got, got funk in my bonnet
Lord, you got a winner
Why don't you get up and dance with the winners?
You see, we don't want no wallflowers in the joint
What we want is somebody who knows how to groove
