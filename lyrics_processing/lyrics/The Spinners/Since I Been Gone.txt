Who you been lovin' baby
Since I been gone
Who you been hugging
Since I been gone
Who you been lovin'
Baby
Since I been gone
Seems to my surprise
There's no time for me
Why, I wonder
Things have changed
Between you and me
Now it's plain to see I'm alone
And on my own
As time goes by I discover
All the things you said
Were quite true
I admit that jealousy
Has a hold on me
Since I can't have you
Since I been gone
Who you been lovin' baby
Since I been gone
Who you been hugging
Since I been gone
Who you been lovin'
Baby
Since I been gone
You might also likeI refuse to cry
Over things we did to each other
Guess I'm just a foolish young man
Doing every thing that I can
To be your man
I thought I'd leave you for ever
But I found my way back to you
I suspect my sanity
Has a hold on me
If I can't have you
Since I been gone
Who you been lovin' baby
Since I been gone
Who you been hugging
Since I been gone
Who you been lovin'
Baby
Since I been gone
I suspect my sanity
Has a hold on me
Since I don't have you
Since I been gone
Who you been lovin' baby
Since I been gone
Who you been hugging
Since I been gone
Who you been lovin'
Baby
Since I been gone
Since I been gone
Who you been lovin' baby
I want you to tell me baby, oooooh
I wanna know
Somebody tell me now baby
I wanna know who you been hugging, baby
Since I been gone
Who you been loving, baby
Since I been gone
I wanna know
You got to tell me
Come on
Oh, oooh
Who you been lovin', baby
Since I been gone
Who you been hugging
Ooooh, I wanna know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, baby baby
Since I been gone
