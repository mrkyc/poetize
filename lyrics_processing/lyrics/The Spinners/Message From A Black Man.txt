No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now

Yes, my skin is black
But that's no reason to hold me back
(Oh, think about it, think about it, think about it, think about it)
(Think about it, think about it, think about it)
I have wants and desires just like you
So move aside because I'm comin' through, oh

No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now

Yes, your skin is white
But tell me, my man, does that make you right?
(Ooh, think about it, think about it, think about it, think about it)
(Think about it, think about it, think about it)
This is a message, a message to y'all
Together we stand, divided we fall

Black is a color just like white
Tell me, how can a color determine whether you're wrong or right?
And we all have our faults, yes we do
So look in the mirror (Look in the mirror)
What do you see? (What do you see?)
Two eyes (Two eyes), a nose (A nose)
And a mouth just like me, oh
You might also like
Oh your eyes are open but you refuse to see
The laws of society were made for both you and me
Because of my color, I struggle to be free
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But in the end, you're gonna see, my friend

No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
(I'm Black and I'm proud)
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
(Oh, we're rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' on)
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
(Oh, rollin' on)
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
(Oh, I'm Black and I'm proud)
