We've been quiet
Said we'd try it for a while
But that was years ago

If you see me, if I see you, mmm
A part of me hopes that we do, no
Say everything we wanted to
After all this time

I cut the tree down that we grew
You know the one we carved our names into?
Still I can't go back to the places we knew
'Cause they ask me if I still think about you
Only all the time

I still think about you, think about you
Only all the time, mmm
I still think about you, think about you
Only all the time
Only all the time
I still think about you, think about you
Only all the time

I still think about you, think about you
Only all the time
I still think about you, think about you
Only all the time

Hometown drivin', autopilot
My phone's on silent in case you call

If you see me, if I see you, mmm
A part of me hopes that we do, no
Say everything we wanted to
After all this time

I cut the tree down that we grew
You know the one we carved our names into?
Still I can't go back to the places we knew
'Cause they ask me if I still think about you
Only all the time

I still think about you, think about you
Only all the time, time, time, time
I still think about you, think about you
Only all the time
I still think about you, think about you
Only all the time
I still think about you, think about you
Only all the time
I still think about you, think about you
Only all the time
I still think about you, think about you
