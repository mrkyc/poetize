Boom the beat goes, everywhere that we go
Life is one big party anyway
(It's just a-) great adventure
Facin' all that danger
Playin' truth or dare like every day

The world's a playground, while
The falls on rainclouds, ca-
-rousels on fair grounds
We love the ride
Confetti rain down
We gonna play now
We got them fireworks
The bang inside

Call your mother
Tell your father
We won't be home for supper
So don't wait up
Grab a lover
Hold each other
Tonight, we going harder
So turn it up

Sweet temptation, re-imagination
There's no sleep for the restless anyway
You be play at night, cuffin' me in light bright
Won't let this moment go away
