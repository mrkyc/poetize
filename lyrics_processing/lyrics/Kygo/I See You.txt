You're more than just a notch in my belt
A story to tell
The only thing on my mind
And it's keeping me up at night (Hmm)
I know you're making magic somewhere
But not by yourself
That might be the reason why
It's keeping me up at night (Hmm)
I can smell you on the pillow where you used to lay
And it's keeping me up at night
And it's keeping me up

Another night, another strangers door
Hoping when it opens I'll see you (Oh oh, oh oooh, oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
You (Oh oh, oh oooh, oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh)

You're more than just a notch in my belt
A story to tell
The only thing on my mind
It's obvious I'm not doing well
Do you see these eyes, when have you known me to cry?
I'm just sitting here remembering how your lips taste
And it's keeping me up at night
And it's keeping me up

Wishing I could go back
Wishing I could go back
Wishing I could go back
Wishing I could go back
To that night
To that stranger's door
Knowing when it opened I'd see you (Oh oh, oh oooh, oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
You (Oh oh, oh oooh, oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
That I'd see you (Oh oh, oh oooh, oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
