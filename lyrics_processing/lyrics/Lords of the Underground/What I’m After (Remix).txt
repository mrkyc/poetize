Just call my name and I'll be there in a hurry
What I'm after, what I'm after, what I'm after
Niggas ain't ready for this shit here, word up
DoItAll, DoItAll, ah, ah

My verbal images test niggas like a scrimmage
So back that ass up and let this brown brother finish
Quick to leave 'em pop-eyed without the fuckin' spinach
My edition ain't new, and the name ain't Michael Bivins
Brings your boys and your two men, and watch them all get ruined
By K-Def, and can't forget the L.O.D. crew and
What I'm after? Disaster, 'cause nothin' brings it faster
Or quicker, especially when I'm high off this liquor
So niggas watch out, come up off the trigger
But this here bullets hittin' Billboards in its liver
So step, don't stare, here's the case for the place
I'll leave it all blown without a thing to trace
So Keith, where you at, nigga? (Right here) Jazz, hit me quicker
And Funke, break it down 'til they particles glitter
I swear to God, my crew is sick like the mob
With mad rhyme niggas who can make that head bob
Here I bring, DoItAll, Keith Murray, and the Funke
So what I'm after, bitches, is the props, plaques, and monies
Where you at, nigga? I want my cash and my grip
Or y'all punk bitches is bound to get hit
I swear to God, my heart on chicks like a bomb
Kaboom, kaboom, now y'all niggas is gone
So check it out y'all 'cause I'm dope on the plastic
Hahaha, now suffocate with the bastard

It's the Lords of the Underground with the L.O.D
(It's Keith Murray with the Lords in this piece)
With the knick knack patty wack, break a nigga's back

And if it come to that, we got the gat in the knapsack
(Niggas poppin' that bullshit)

Ayo, let's battle with the style that crowd choose
Defeatin' me is not findin' a word in the dictionary that I use
First of all, I stress niggas like AIDS tests
I'll wax half you rappers, let the Lords take the rest
Fuck fame, keep it real, street, call my name
I'll run up on ya, put drama all in your blood vein
(Yo, Keith, what you mean?)
I'll run up on you with a dirty needle filled with dope fiend
Put it in your bloodstream
I'll pop your top like a Guinness Stout
Chop your ass up and bury ya somewhere down south
Don't get it twisted, I never knew your punk ass L.O.D. crew existed
Y'all niggas is unlisted
Keep my waves glarin', got niggas starin'
But I ain't carin' 'cause my Squad is Def and they ain't hearin'
Shit comin' from the inadequate side
Y'all niggas fuck around and catch a ambulance ride
You got beef with Keith, be discreet
I'll push all y'all motherfuckers' wigs back to the white meat
Niggas jealous 'cause my style is butter Parkay
But I'ma keep doin' this shit my way
I'll train my junior L.O.D. platoon to murder niggas up on the moon
Soon niggas will see that Keith Murray ain't havin' it
All y'all niggas is pussy, I'm doin' it my way

I, in the the name of the supreme grandmaster of the universe
Have been sent to Earth
(Who are you?) Emperor Gamma Funkula
From the planet Jupiter, interplanetary superstar
Why don't you tell me what you're after while you're rhymin'
Earth currency, gold, platinum and your diamonds
See, God decided there was too many MC's
Crowdin' up the planet, causin' famine and disease
So now I must divide through space and time
Bring fire from hell to the skies
I am the future, battle and you wush, nigga
I'll be all up in you like a douche, nigga
See, I don't battle, fool, I wage wars
The likes of which you never saw, uncut raw
You wanna play? Situation gettin' steamier
Feel them gamma rays, break you down like leukemia
Sometimes I sit and wonder what you tryna rhyme for
Tryna get with me, I teach MC's skills like Job Corp
See, I was sent to Earth because there's something outta order
All you fools are corny, must be something in the water
I grab the mic and get lifted like Keith Murray
Make all wack MC's remove themselves in a hurry
Word is bond, Lords of the Underground got it goin' on
In your town, I'll be ballin' on and on, check it out
I know you, you know me
It's the Lords of the Underground with the L.O.D
With the knick knack patty wack, break a nigga's back
And if it come to that, we got the gat in the knapsack

And if it come to that, we got the gat in the knapsack

Funk from the street
Yes, I'm comin' live so unshuffle your feet, nigga
Yeah, 50 Grand's on the fuckin' creep, nigga
That's why I'm comin' in with the L.O.D
