All I need is the chick that like to smoke the chronic
Butt-naked in Prada heels straight blowing the chronic
With an ass so fat it's kinda hard to get behind it
Can't cook, but she make a mean Gin & Tonic
Chick from the 'burbs comin' to see me in the hood
On some Halle Berry shits, talkin' about make me feel good
So I blaze up the purple in and I passed it to her
Take two hits of that, there, that should do it
I might tap ya baby's mom, but I ain't want her, man
This chick's got more kids than 
She might spend the night, and we'd probably do it
But she getting out early like Martha Stewart

How you doing, ma? They called me Funk man
I just wanna know if I could change you plans
How you doing, ma? My name is DoItAll
I just had to let you know that you're beautiful

Sandy complexion, Dominican descent
  fragrance this close to her amazing
That look in her eye make a grown man cry
Thick lips, thick hips, thick to the tilt
Thick as all hell, nigga I ain't goin' lie
She a freak with the shades, have you seen when you walk by
I like her though, she know where she can't go
And still look sweet like that tat on her ankle
I purposely try not to get one
That was so perfectly put together
Cause with that bad whether the  will follow
And the chick'll do you like 
Do it all ladies for the lack of introduction
I'm usually not out late partyin' and clubbin'
I'm tryna go platinum so I had to do somethin'
Excuse my manners, can I make you more comfortable?
How you doing, ma? My name is DoItAll
