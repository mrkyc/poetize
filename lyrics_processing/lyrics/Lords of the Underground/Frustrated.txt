What's goin' on? I'm so frustrated
Tell me what's wrong? I'm so frustrated
What's goin' on? I'm so frustrated
Tell me what's wrong? I'm so frustrated
What's goin' on? I'm so frustrated
Tell me what's wrong? I'm so frustrated
What's goin' on? I'm really frustrated
Tell me what's wrong? I'm really frustrated
Yeeeaoh!
{Verse 1: DoItAll}
Once again, it's the Lords comin' straight from the under
I drop you like this last time, so now you wish a blunder
I know what you were thinkin' (Uh), your hopin' I am sinkin'
High now it goes, it must come down, but that ain't what I'm meanin'
I'm this brownskin brother, tryna figure out my tactics
My girls want number one in Billboard, now you want my ass kicked? (Ooh)
So what's the flavor, hobbs? Do you love it or not?
Or is it the fact that Blue passed you with my hip-hop?
Ding-dong, that's it, oh my God (Woo)
The brothers are jealous because the Lord's are comin' off (Ahh)
I guess the picture, frustrated 'cause I ripped ya
I bet you didn't ever think this Jersey style would hit ya like Pain
Do I jump up to do my thing?
'Cause if I wasn't here, then my crew would do the same
Aggravated with your stalk, irritated with your walk
And all I can hear is frustration in your talk, ha!
I got you bubblin', 'cause now you are discoverin'
My style is untouchable, on another like no other one
So say their names! I can't say their names
Yo, say their names! I can't say their names
'Cause if I say their names, it might cause some pain
And I ain't in this game to bring another fame
So, uhm, check the rise, the rise to the top
I know some brothers hate it, but they just frustrated
You might also like
What's goin' on? I'm so frustrated
Tell me what's wrong? I'm really frustrated
What's goin' on? I'm so frustrated
Tell me what's wrong? I'm really frustrated
What's goin' on? I'm so frustrated
Tell me what's wrong? I'm really frustrated
What's goin' on? I'm so frustrated
Tell me what's wrong? I'm really frustrated

Who's the man with the ill funk plan? Hey!
Mr. Funky Man!
 I know you mad

'Cause I blew up like you expected
'Cause I get the trooper loot, comin' connected and respected
Yo, mirror, mirror, mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me is there anybody catchin' with the Lords?
Nobody, nooo, nobody
That's what I thought
Who's the victim when I'm kickin', when I'm kickin'
Is it me or is it you or should I just keep rippin'? (Rippin')
The funkadelic flavor, from North that I save up
You ask for the funk, so the funk is what I gave ya
And back up in the picture with the baritone vocals
And still got that stuff that makes you ''Oh No'' like Yoko
Stress, vexed, tired of the mess
'Cause '93 hit me with enough to catch a complex
What's goin' on? I'm so frustrated
Tell me what's wrong? I'm really frustrated
What's goin' on? I'm so frustrated
Tell me what's wrong? I'm so frustrated

Check it, just open the eyes and make the juicy Mister Funky Man speakin'
He's rippin' shows, every single week and niggas hectic
I pick up on the mic and then I check it
You rappers got jealous because the Lords came to wreck it
But little do they know, there's somethin' wrong with my brain
I fear no man and I feel no pain
Who cares about your name? I built the House Of Pain
With Alice In Chains, Throw Momma From The Train
See I'm the one who showed Madonna how to strike them poses (True)
I'm not one of those rebels, claimin' I've got Guns'N'Roses
Mister Funky Man, here to make you funky
Right up in your ears with the, with the fresh funky
They came and took what's yours, come on and press the issue
But tryna diss the Lords, there must be somethin' wrong wit' you
Tell me what it is, baby
Is it that you can't make any funky?
Is it that you're poor, broke and lonely?
First you need to learn who you talkin' to, 
I'm the Lord Chief Rocka Number One
Chief Rocka grabs the mic and I get amped, I feel like Dr. Fly
Like I'm never gettin' older, I'm never gonna die
So come on now, do you really wanna hurt me?
I don't think so
Who you shootin'? Boy, you need to stop plottin'
You soft like a muffin and you ain't sayin' nothin', you're frustrated
What's goin' on? I'm so frustrated
Tell me what's wrong? I'm so frustrated
What's goin' on? I'm really frustrated
Tell me what's wrong? I'm so frustrated
What's goin' on? I'm so frustrated
Tell me what's wrong? I'm so frustrated
What's goin' on? I'm really frustrated
Tell me what's wrong? I'm so frustrated
What's goin' on? I'm so frustrated
