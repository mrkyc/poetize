Everybody funky but they don't know how
Let the Lords of the Underground show you how
Everybody funk and they don't know how
Let the Lords of the Underground show you how

Well I was born in the year of the black 
When my moms did the wop in the bellbottom suit
Now I'm picking at my 'fro, so you better beware
'Cause I'm coming with that funk like I just don't care
Well I'm whoops-a-daisy, my parents had a funk baby
Now I am an addict, and that shit's got me crazy
Sending 
And nothing but the rhymes trying to bust 
I'm doing head bops to  to a tune that knocks
With atomic dog burying bones in the box
Now everybody want to be a funk-ateer
But don't know how  funk rip the 
So check it, now I got it locked on the record
And if you go and get it, I bet you won't regret it
So peep it, just like the joint 
A rebel for that funk, and that's how I keep it
You might also like
I'll be the keeper of the funk, they know just who I am
I'll be the keeper of the funk, they know just who I am
I'll be the keeper of the funk, they know just who I am
I'll be the keeper of the funk, they know just who I am
'Cause I'm coming with that funk like I just don't care
I'll be the keeper of the funk, they know just who I am
I'll be the keeper of the funk, they know just who I am
I'll be the keeper of the funk, they know just who I am
I'll be the keeper of the funk, they know just who I am
'Cause I'm coming with that funk like I just don't care

All hail gamma funkular 
I can't wait to get on stage, grab the mic, and show my ass
And if the girl is on my tip, then check her
I ain't joking, 'cause if I get her to my crib I'll be stroking
Check it, 
A-yo, what's wrong? I wanna rip it but my mind's telling me no (Why?)
'Cause I don't wanna hurt nobody
(Man, why don't you stop playin', go grab the mic and rock the party?)
I was born in the undergrounds of Newark NJ
Where the other  funk lords used to play
I was raised  the funky child
But now they done stole my funk and they done went buckwild
I'm gonna tell you on the real, none of y'all 


Now when the mothership landed, even though not on a planet
I still felt that vibe, that's why I feel like slammin'
So here, take a little bit, mix the funk with scripture
Hip-hop with that funk, now here by the picture
