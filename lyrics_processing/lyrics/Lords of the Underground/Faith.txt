It's been 21 years since I rose from the crotch
Now that I'm grown I just sit back and watch
Been almost 2 years since I dropped my first jam
You still don't give me props but hey I understand
You do what you got to keep from sinkin' in the sand
Nowadays everybody wants to be the man
Whenever I'm around you put up a front and shake my hand
Smilin' in my face but can't wait to take my place
So you can all be jealous but learn some control
Be a man about it if you're a swole say you're swole
Cause though you don't respect me you can never break my heart
Because I kept the faith and stayed true to the art
:
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
He won't deceive me, believe me
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
Believe me
(Let the faith set you free)
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
He won't deceive me, believe me
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
Believe me
(Let the faith set you free)

Well here's the jeep banger of the year
I'm on another level but I still hang with my peers
I got a couple of friends but why are they friends?
Is it cause I hip hop and now I got ends?
Although it used to be hard, it's easy for the skins
Because I'm making music and I'm settin' mad trends
Now it's got me wonderin' thinkin to myself
"Will they be there when I'm knocked off the shelf?"
Cause people come around only when you're doin' well
Or when they try to pull you down by tuggin' on your tail
So what the hell?
(You got the faith)
So if you tryin' to pull us down
Well boy I swear it's too late
Cause I got assistance beyond dissin' sistas
And yeah you can hear it when it's blastin' in the system
My lyrical is spiritual so don't get hysterical
Cause when I'm doing well boy it ain't no miracle
It's the faith
:
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
He won't deceive me, believe me
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
Believe me
(Let the faith set you free)
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
He won't deceive me, believe me
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
Believe me

Now as the world play this game of ring around the rosy
You find a lot of jealous people always being nosy
I try to stay away from all you scandalous snakes in the grass
That's always in your ass
All up in my biz like "Yo, how can I be down?"
Leave me alone and stop jockin' me clown
When I was dead broke you wouldn't have nothin' to do with me
But now all of a sudden yo you wanna crack a brew with me?
:
Never did I think about the worth of my birth
Not until now, it took my man to get hurt
So Jazz tell me do you feel the struggle?
(I feel the struggle)
So oooh I guess I flow with the notes
I'm doin what I'm doin and I'm doin this for you
And with this in mind, see I won't stop pursue
The credibility and the originality
You know the type of stuff that takes me to the t.o.p?
The faith
:
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
He won't deceive me, believe me
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
Believe me
(Let the faith set you free)
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
He won't deceive me, believe me
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
