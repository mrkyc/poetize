Ayo, Funke, wake up! (Huh?)
Turn your radio up! (What?!)
It's us!
(It's Us!) Yeah, listen to the cut, it's our style! (Our style?)
Your style (Stop brother)
Ayo nigga wake up, let me show you somethin'!
Listen to the way they flip the metaphors and phrases
Listen, listen, it's drivin' me crazy
'Cause everytime I do a style and flip it kind of simple
Brothers say, "That's phat" and do it on the demo
From a demo to a promo, now a hit on the radio
Next thing you know, they'll be doing our video
(Same one?) Same one! Concepts, whole nine
And crazy similarities to the whole rhyme
I'm not worried though (Why?)
I'm flipping hits from the grill
And in the underground only real stays real, so umm
Check the skills, the skills are kinda ill and yo
Here Come the Lords, cause we're here to make a kill!

Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!

Ayo, Marley! (Ayo, what's up knocka?)
Do you hear these suckas trying to clock the Lord Chief Rocka
(Yeah I hear 'em, they're just a bunch of clones on your bone)
Hold up, I'm trying to figure out where could they get my style from
Ayo, wait a minute, remember the tape you shopped around a while back?
(Yo what, wasn't that your boys?)
Now they got our stuff down pat!
(Yo man don't sweat it, just show 'em why they call you Mr. Funke)
(Yo Lord Jazz, pass me some of that Brass, Brass Monkey)
Here Come the Lords, Here Come the Lords, Mr. Funke don't you see me?
I told you we were coming, you suckas didn't believe me
The Skipper, my Lords style stick like Jack the Ripper
I'm hanging other rappers like your girl hangs on my zipper
Lord Jazz Hit Me One Time, make it funky
Stop being stingy knocka, pass that Brass Monkey
I step off a stage, everyone knows who I am
Grab the mic like Teddy Riley and I Jam (oh Jam)
Give me the mic and watch me wax that ass
Keep the camera moving 'cause I'm kinda fast
You can trip, you can flip, you could even slip or dip
But you'll never ever rip, Funke style as good as this
Because you sound like you're drugged, you might as well be a singer
Your whimsy couldn't touch me if your name was Sticky Fingaz
So when I come around, don't try to be down, don't try to be down
Just dig the sound, cause here comes the Lords of the Underground
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!

Well um, open up the doors and yell "Here Come the Lords"
Yell it loud, yell it loud, let me hear it from a crowd
I packs 'em, In the Closet like Michael Jackson
And love to hear the girls go "ooh!" when I'm rockin'
So catch it, no stutter in my flow but I wrecks it
And caught you on the dillz from my jam called Check It
Check it, check it, check it, check it, microphone check it
Yeah, you went wild, 'cause your moms digs my records
So come on, I'm taking you where the sun don't shine
The underground, but everything is fine
I rhyme copacetic, unless it gets hectic
Your vocal chords'll get cracked, you gets no Chloraseptic
So hit em, so chill, chill man chill
I know who used to be but now who's Top Bill'
Well it's me, and yes, I am back by the Funke
Marley filled the House with Hits so you know The Lords are chunky
We stink, like pee-eww, funk from a shoe
But what about this funk can two brothers like us do?
But get down like James Brown and rock the whole town
Hah! And now The Lords have broke ground
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
Here Come the Lords!
