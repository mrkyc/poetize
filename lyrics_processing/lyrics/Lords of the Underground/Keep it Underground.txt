Underground

Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
(Yeah, keep it underground)
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground

I have an underground contract
(With who?) My music
To freak it, freak it, and do it like they used to
So here it is, the real for the rugged
And let  say, "I wonder how he does it?"
Well, see it's simple: I wreck an instrumental
And ring your damn eardrums as if I was a cymbal
Like RING
Watch the DoItAll do his thing
I might pack the verse but the verse won't sing
See, now I'm off my rock
I think I need a doc
But I don't need a camera unless they take me pop
So, um, dig it
Watch the Jersey boy, um, kick it
And unplug this jam if you're feelin' kind of timid
So here we go, long live the flow
And I know you hear the rap with 'em, catch me at a show
And um, get down no matter how it sounds
The Lords, The Lords
You gotta keep it underground
You might also like
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
(Keep it underground, gotta keep it underground)
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground

Check it, check it, ugh
Watch me make it funky for your town
Check it, check it, check it out
Watch me, check-a, check-a my style
I stink, people think I sleep with a skunk
'Cause I open up my throat then I give you all the funk
All you rappers on my tip, you know you need to get off
You try to disrespect me, I try to knock your head off
So get ready for the real hard rhymer
Save the drama, I'm eatin' other rappers like Jeffery Dahmer
You get two smacks for thinkin' I'm a new jack
Like Kid Capri said, "The joke is on you jack!"
'Cause if another steps to the bad brother
I strike you like your father, word to the mother
You suckers might as well get lost 'cause I'm the boss
You'll catch a three-piece, with biscuits and extra sauce
This time around, I caught you with your pants down
Now pull your drawers up, and keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
(Keep it underground, keep it underground)
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground

Mr. Funke have to get hard on this record
To show you I can even switch styles and still wreck it
The Lords Of The Underground the ones who hold the crown
Whoever told you we was wack really didn't know what they was talkin' bout
You're jealous of my crew
The news is that you're sweatin' me
Get off my tip and find something else to do
I mean come on now, how you figure?
If Marley didn't think that we was dope, then I guess we wouldn't be here nigga
And you can even check my album, All G Funk
Leave a bunch of girls singin', talkin' bout "ooh la la, ooh la la"
But some of these rappers are dead wrong
Pick up their albums and you hear somebody sing on every other song
So let it come from the heart and let it flow through your veins
And the streets will definitely scream your name
Peace to the Ice Cube and peace to the Kool G
You only get your props if you come from beneath
Now the Hit Squad (GETS PROPS)
And um, Cypress Hill (GETS PROPS)
And um, PM Dawn (DOES NOT)
Now um, Naughty By Nature (GETS PROPS)
And The Geto Boys (GETS PROPS)
But uh, Me Phi Me (DOES NOT)
Now back to the sound
The wrecks your whole town
And like the jam says
Keep it underground!

Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
(You gotta keep it underground, you got to keep it underground)
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
(Keep it underground, you gotta keep it underground)
Keep it underground
Keep, keep it underground
Keep it underground
