Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
Hey yo funke pack your bags once again, it's on
Off on the road again, more like home
Now make sure you pack a bag with the cappa rats
And a head full of freestyles to prove it ain't a whack
We're headin to the venues across the nation
Due to last album's underground sensation
Survive with the vibe what you feel inside
Is it real? (It's real!) well then let it ride
With the funk, still got that funk, always got the funk cause I know it's what ya want, um I
Speak to my peeps with the beats from the streets
I guess when on the road that's why they cling to our meats
The girls be jackin', the guys be watchin, but no it's not The Lords, it's the hype they're clockin'
Weave our Glocks with hip-hop, so watch as they
They know we don't care if they're ready or not
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
When I'm pink in the bird do ya know I rocka socka .. MCs
You know I'm not havin it, my skills are well crafted
My bounce to the ounce, my bounce in the mattress
So catch me I'm leakin', and not when I'm thinkin, cuz when caught with thinkin, I can catch up yer sneakin
So back to the deala, the lord's a mag dealer and the rope is equipped with tips to get familiar so I'm never neglectin it even though it's hectic, it's something I love that's why I'm always struttin
So I step to the comas,  my pace is
Just to get away from those who press my luck

Mr. Funkyman, ? is on the bird again
That's right so have no fear
Lords of the Underground are here, put your hands in the air
And let me drop the microphone and kick the funky sound
I'm out to make you party like its 1999
Check it ass out make it funky for ya
Step to the rear if you're hip to see the point
Jackson, underground, shit was full of action
Give them nothing but the facts and hear me keep ya satisfaction
I rock it till the mic gets hot, ready or not, let me show you what I got no stop
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
You just don't understand what it takes to make the Lords of the Under
How we're keepin hope alive sometimes it makes me wonder
Where in the world did I ever get the courage
To step onstage and send the crowd into a rage
I say the rhythm comin that's when I commence the rotten
When I move across the stage, it can look as if I'm plottin
With my funk on, you put the funk on? I got to get my funk on. You gotta put your funk on
I never been one to be jealous of what another man has
I learn my own business and wash my own hands
I never call girls hoes and bitches when I'm rapping
Cuz I'd rather not talk about it manage to survive without it
To tell the truth, I got to much on my mind
To waste my time just attack the women when I rhyme
Either way the lord's house is gonna stack
This hour will be fat, remember we'll be back
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (face)
