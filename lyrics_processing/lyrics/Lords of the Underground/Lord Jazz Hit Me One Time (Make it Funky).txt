Lord Jazz, hit me one time, make it funky
Lord Jazz, hit me one time, make it funky

Lord Jazz, hit me one time for the people
'Cause I bet they're not believing that you come from Cleveland
Mix the funk, with the skunk, so they'll boom it in the trunk
And play it loud as hell so they'll feel like they're drunk
Now umm, back and forth, forth and back
You see he always help me out when I get wack to his tracks
So peace to Mr. Funke, for drinking all the Monkey
And Lord Jazz, hit me one time, make it funky!

"Excuse me Mr. Funke man? Yes, DoItAll!"
"Excuse me Mr. Funke man? Yes, DoItAll!"
"Excuse me Mr. Funke man? Yes, DoItAll!"

Lord Jazz the name, so watch me scratch it in your brain
It's simple, so watch me ride these tracks like a train
I freak it with the cut, now I freak it with the rhyme
Just to let you know, I can hit you one time
With the scratch and the rap 'cause you know I'm all that
And those who said I couldn't, I see your hands clap
Ya heard it, my lips spit quick like Wordsworth
And I'm quick to do a DJ when he's walkin on my turf
