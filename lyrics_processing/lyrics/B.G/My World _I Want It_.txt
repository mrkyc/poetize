Your number one original hot boy...ya heard

You could bounce wit it....you could buck wit it
And you could roll wit it...ya heard me..
My dawg smurf I'm tellin' you did this here
This that Life After Cash Money world and I'm gonna bring 'em in my world

I want it, you got it, don't make me have to go in your pocket
I want it, you got it, don't make me have to go in your pocket
This is for my hot boys and my hot girls, ride wit me, I'ma bring you up in my world
This is for my hot boys and my hot girls, ride wit me, I'ma bring you up in my world

My ghetto pass go state to state
I could go in any hood 'cuz I ain't fake
I'll bob my head, I'll stomp my feet
For Soulja Slim, won't you do that Nolia Clap with me
Say Hot Girl, don't play with me
Like Ying Yang, Let me see you salt shake for me
I'm on the move, No stoppin' this
Cash Money move over I gots this
I'm 'bout to fuck the game up, just watch this
When it's over I bet I see a profit
I'm a CEO, I'm a artist too
I'm a hustler, I can get work from Florida too
Don't fuck with me, I'll stump you
If you score the right amount, I'll front you
I talk this shit 'cuz I'm bout this shit
Ain't no way I could run a way out this shit

I got four road dawgs that's goin' to jail
I'm takin care they baby momma that ain't got no bail
I keeps it real, if you real you know
I'm in the game, so I gotta play the game how it go
See where I'm from they got hoes that grind
On the block all day gotta respect they mind
They'll cut you up, they'll mace you too
And they got a baby nine they'll spray at you
It's eye-for-eye I go pound-for-pound
I'm New Orleans, only hopin' I'ma hold it down
Either roll with me, when I'm rolling through
Or I guarantee I'ma roll over you
I'm a fool wit it
Give me that work, I show you what to do wit it
My cousin in seventh grade sent him to school wit it
By seventh period, he through wit it
It's Chopper City


I represent my dawg Soulja
That's why you can catch me in that Nolia
I'm a gangsta, the streets backin' me
I ain't goin' back to Baby, stop askin' me
It's C-H-O double P-E-R...C-I-T-Y
Nigga, till the day I die
I'm from the hood, I'm down to earth
When I'm in the streets I be out there head first
I'm on the creep, with no sleep
I ain't trynna rest till the enemy six feet
It's game time, and I'm ready to play
Gimme my remote and my remote is my K
I spray with it, I'm from uptown
I gotta stay wit it
When we murder, we know how to get away wit it
We do our slick, one shot to the head is how we slank a bitch
