It's B.Gizzle
Heard me
Cut the music up, yeah that's good
Too Hood 2 Be Hollywood
Bet somethin', shoot somethin'
One of realest niggas that ever done it
But know you ain't gon' do nothin'
Right chyeah
Ya heard me
Live in livin' color
Ghetto

It's like B.Gizzle got a world wide ghetto pass
I'll murk a nigga, take a flight to the motherland
I fear God only, never fear another man
It's never one hustle, I always got a backup plan
It ain't no secret, I can tell ya 'bout the gutta man
I'ma write a book 'bout how to come out the struggle man
When I come through, you know what's in them duffle bags
A lot of gats, a lot of cash, and some ski masks
You know my street pass, it been certified
Stop lyin', I'm a G you've been heard about
Stop rippin', you a pussy, I've been heard of you
You playin' with a gangsta, homie? The nerve of you!
Oh you lookin' for me? Well, dog, I'm ookin' for you
I'ma have your people wearing a "rest in peace" shirt of you
My reputation on the block been A1
I'm the same N.O nigga I been since day 1

I said throw somethin', shoot somethin'
You just talkin' I know you ain't gon' do nothin'
Pussy nigga, ya heard me
If you got somethin' to lose, you gon' lose somethin' unless you do somethin'
Ya heard me
Gotta use what you learned in order to receive what you earned
Make sure ya heard me
Real niggas do real things, recognize real niggas in the game
I know ya heard me
You say ya heard me, I say ya heard me, he say ya heard me
I know you heard me, she say ya heard me, everybody like it when I say ya heard me

You got a lot of nerve, be talkin' a lot of hut
Only round your homies, when I'm round you don't hear not a word
I'm a heathen who fight for what he believe in
And I don't have no plans on leavin' 'til I get even
Salt and pepper, nigga I'm seasoned for any reason
The day you want somethin' with Juve, come on and see him
My G ain't gon' allow me to lose
I'm bustin' shots as soon as you make a move, ooh
I'm not a fan of fools, that's why I got attitude
Runnin' your mouth to me, I'ma try to get at a dude
Don't even have a tool, what is you tryna prove?
Gon' head and choose, you can die wearin' them designer shoes
I said bet somethin', shoot somethin'
You just talkin' I know you ain't gon' do nothin'
Pussy nigga, ya heard me
If you got somethin' to lose, you gon' lose somethin' unless you do somethin'
Ya heard me
Gotta use what you learned in order to receive what you earned
Make sure ya heard me
Real niggas do real things, recognize real niggas in the game
I know ya heard me
You say ya heard me, I say ya heard me, he say ya heard me
I know you heard me, she say ya heard me, everybody like it when I say ya heard me

N.O. on my fitted, committed to my city
Anything I will commit it, just to show that I'm committed
Commit it then get acquitted, ay Gizzle let me get 'em
Gizzle let me get 'em, eat em up then shit 'em
And ain't no explanation for this damn insanity
I'm a monster like I'm part of the Addams Family
And some say I am old, but I'm new to a few
And I'm blessed achoo
I came to get me and I got you and I'm so me and I'm not you
And even if you get married, you couldn't do what I do
Now let me get high off my drug scandals
Life's a gamble
I said bet somethin', shoot somethin'
You just talkin' I know you ain't gon' do nothin'
Pussy nigga, ya heard me
If you got somethin' to lose, you gon' lose somethin' unless you do somethin'
Ya heard me
Gotta use what you learned in order to receive what you earned
Make sure ya heard me
Real niggas do real things, recognize real niggas in the game
I know ya heard me
You say ya heard me, I say ya heard me, he say ya heard me
