I been on the road movin coke and slangin raps
Traveling putting Chopper City on the map
I know I'm a get it with other niggas
I'm the underdawg so they doubt a nigga
But the streets bout a nigga
I'm a uptown big dawg and everyone Baby left hangin'
I'm comin' back to get'chall
And we gone do it like real niggas do
Not one maybach ten lac's comin through
We all got bitches on 24's spinnin
That's how it's goin down when a real nigga get it
That's why they holdin back and they won't break bread
Cuz they already now how B.Gizzle gone play it
I'm a go in the hood bring 'em another route
All my niggas with bonds I'm a get 'em out
All my niggas with monkeys I help get 'em off they back
I done got ride of mine so we rockin like that nigga

Man I know people who know people
That give me work on the strength
I don't even have to owe people
I know arabs that know arabs
They get work from overseas
I bring it on V.L. and on the ave
I'm off the block so I'm a hold it down
I'm gonna pump this white I'm gonna bump this brown
I'm gonna get it out the mud I'm gonna stand my ground
Nigga play me once I ain't backin down
Nigga fucked me once think he fuck in me again
I might aswell go to jail and be a punk then
I got connects in Detroit Michigan
You coke price fucked up see yo boy and I'm fixin it
I be all in Atlanta Georgia
I still be hollerin at them haitians down in Miami Florida
I'm a hustler, Baby said he fired me
But that wasn't nothin cause the streets hired me

Geezy where you been man Geezy where you been

I done had a one on one with Lil Wayne
Told him I got the game for him to do his own thing
I done had a one on one with Lil Turk
I told him kick that dope and we can make shit work
I done had a one on one with Juve to
I told him handle his business and holla when he through
Nigga know I'm a Hotboy for life
But I ain't goin back ain't no matter the price
I don't need no nigga nigga need me
I'll jack him 'fore I let him birdfeed me
I'm a fool with that pistol better ask around
If I'm broke I make niggas pay draft Uptown
I had coke make a fiend catch a cab Uptown
I told him on V.L. on the ave Uptown
It's 2004 if you real then you know
The streets is all mine Chopper City in the door
(Outro: Ziggler The Wiggler)
Yeah
Believe dat there Baby
This Ziggler The Wiggler ya understand what I'm sayin'
This is Life After Cash Money, you know I'm talkin' 'bout
The head nigga in charge B. Gizzle
You wan' know where he been
He been tryna make a dollar outta 15 cents Baby
But guess what
He took it all the way back to violence and Magnolia, ya understand me
Where Chopper City originated at, you know I'm sayin'
So he say Ziggay, we gon' be rockin' like a cut off stockin' baby
