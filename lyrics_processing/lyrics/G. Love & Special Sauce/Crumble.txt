I'm free falling, darling, in the rising sun
Brushing on your cheek, shining steady through the blinds
I thought I told myself that I would take my time
I'm sure I said I wasn't ready, she said she wasn't looking
It's not my fault that she's so good looking
But she took her time, but I was holding single life
I'm plain available, she said, she's emotionally unavailable
But that means
I'm down with that
She kick the cat out, kid
So I didn't call her back

Castles burning thorough the sky
Shift to shake and I know why
They say life is what happens when you're busy making plans
(?) I start to understand
You and I were meant for each other
And we're gonna stick together
When the world starts to crumble
Hey yeah, let me hear you say
Hey yeah, (you can fall on me)
Hey yea, let me here you say
Hey yea, (you can fall on me)
You might also likeTwo weeks past and I still didn't call
But your name was in my brain like graffiti on the train
I didn't mean to buck you out but I didn't have your number
I saw you on the bus and you were chilling with some other guy
I was like, damn, I was jealous
But you gave me a look and your smile's the same
And then three hours later, my phone did ring
And it was you telling me, would I like to chill
At this corner bar
On the block that was real laid back
And I'm like 'yeah it's on'

Castles burning thorough the sky
Shift to shake and I know why
They say life is what happens when you're busy making plans
(?) I start to understand
You and I were meant for each other
And we're gonna stick together
When the world starts to crumble
Hey yeah, let me hear you say
Hey yeah, (you can fall on me)
Hey yea, let me here you say
Hey yea, (you can fall on me)
When no one knows what tomorrow will bring
But you can fall back on me when you can't win
This world is moving faster, tougher everyday
Oh baby, just take a deep breath and
Let your troubles all fade away
I showed up late, that really teed her off
We couldn't agree on much but the vibes was strong
Basically, I fell in love with those big green eyes
You could say what you want 'cause I was mesmerized
Now three years later
And the feeling so fresh
We stick together
Sunshine, stormy weather

Castles burning thorough the sky
Shift to shake and I know why
They say life is what happens when you're busy making plans
(?) I start to understand
You and I were meant for each other
And we're gonna stick together
When the world starts to crumble
Hey yeah, let me hear you say
Hey yeah, (you can fall on me)
Hey yea, let me here you say
Hey yea, (you can fall on me)
Hey yeah, let me hear you say
Hey yeah, (you can fall on me)
Hey yea, let me here you say
