Cool breeze through the trees sings a song so sweet
For my baby and my boo boo, asleep they lay
So I picked up my guitar and I started to play
The music was pulsing blood up to my eyes
I surmised the horizon, sun rising, surprising
The hell out of the clouds
Like they were kissed for the first time
The sun was steady rising and I'm sitting in the sunshine
I hear my baby crying and he's just waking up
So I walk through the screen door and I go pick him up
Rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka back and forth
Baby quit crying then I'll go and play some more
Soft and sweet melodies while your mama's sleeping
Let her sleep in late this morning
Let her sleep till the sun is burning down
Baby baby hold my fingers with your little, tiny hands
While we lounge in a hammock checking out all the land
I smell the sweet scents of papaya and lime
I smell the ocean breezes, the salt and my mind
Is captivated by your big brown eyes which remind me of mine
Now I know we're two of a kind
Rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka back and forth
Baby quit crying then I'll go and play some more

Let her sleep in late this morning
Let her sleep till the sun is burning down
Burning down, burning down, burning down
The day is getting brighter and the wind is breezing down
The whole tree is shaking, fallen fruit is on the ground
I smile when I'm thinking about the love I've found
Mama's still sleeping so we play these mellow sounds
Soft and sweet melodies while your mama's sleeping
Let her sleep in late this morning
Let her sleep till the sun is burning
Soft and sweet melodies while your mama's sleeping
Let her sleep in late this morning
Let her sleep till the sun is burning down
Burning down
Soft and sweet melodies while your mama's sleeping
Let her sleep in late this morning
Let her sleep till the sun is burning
Soft and sweet melodies while your mama's sleeping
