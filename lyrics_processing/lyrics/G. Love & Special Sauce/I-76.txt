6525 Parkline drive
And like always I'm kickin' it live
Gonna call the fellas to see if they is with this
Gonna get down with the sound of Big Breakfast
Start off the day with some Bob Marley
Back to the woods for that fresh parley
Maybe even spark a little Nicky J
And then it's off to Center City in the fastest way

'Cause if you gotta get downtown real quick
Then the only way to go is I-76
Unless of course you wanna take that scenic view
Then the east or west river drive is right for you
But if you ain't gotta anytime to lose
Put the pedal to the metal for that voyage cruise
And get on down to I-76
'Cause in 1996 there ain't no tricks to the mix

Back in 1982, man it was real cool
And in school if we got good grades
Like straight up As
Our parents would take us to a 76ers game
Big shot, and Mo Cheeks, and Moses Malone
Julius Erving called Philly his home
Bobby Jones, Darryl Dawkins, Andrew Toney takin' 3s
Rocky Balboa come from South Philly
But if you wanna make it on time to the show
There's only one road that you really have to know
So get to Fishtown without all that jive
I suggest that you drive on I-95
Wanna get downtown but feelin' the fix
Get on that road they call 676
The most expensive, expansive piece of interstate they ever made
The fellas ain't famous but they got good game

Shh-hoops the middle man
Now disguised as the joy
Valentine smiles to the Cottmon boy
Loungin' leather seats 76
Gettin' nice Cadillac DBL, kristopher pulled the heist
Expressway expression soda pop pressin'
Up another piece baby new year painted session
I'm guessin' the answer to the question
All the Philly fellas livin'
Life is our profession
Destined to escape a la spector
Ah wilderness yea prep jetta boy
Friday night rap broncos and pepper shakers
In the city ice dogs love show I the skyscraper
And the route?
Man, it's I-76
I'm loungin' otto shoup singin' davey quickness
Li li of the va li love a ligum everyday
I'm givin' praise from high hill juice to Philly
'Cause if you gotta get downtown real quick
Then the only way to go is I-76
Unless of course you wanna take that scenic view
Then the east or west river drive is right for you
But hop you ain't gotta any time to lose
Put the pedal to the metal for that voyage cruise
And get on down to I-76
'Cause in 1996 there ain't no tricks to the mix
