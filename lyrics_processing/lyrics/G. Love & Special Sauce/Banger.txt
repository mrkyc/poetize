We're gunna do a, thank you, thank you very much
Were gunna do a little thing right now.)
Just sittin' here thinkin' about this life of mine
All of my troubles they're my good times
Black panther cub
Gotta lotta love
From the bottom to the top
Underground or up above
Not your average rig-a-ma-role
Just playin' the role
Instead I set my path in a bowl
The mic I control with weather control
A cold make 'em lose control
Lo and behold
Paint these rhymes candy like a ho on the stroll
Told them its a cold piece of work in the cold world
Still my only joy when i hold the flow like the North Pole
All magnetism
Like the nay sayers sayin' Nope!
They can eat crow
I sure improve to approve
They never knew and grew and grew
Walked around the locks in a room
When it seemed impossible
Still had to do my best
John Henry and had a straight do it
The deal went sour
Got the will power
In and out
Beat the challenges
Whenever however
Just say it

It's a banger
It's a banger
It's a banger
Just sittin' here thinkin' about this life of mine
All of my troubles they're my good times
Sometimes i wanna just roll down a coast
Roll out and post
Put away the goals I'm approachin'
And hella chief than blow out the smoke
Blows on the curtains
Goes beneath below all the surface shit
We hold like the inner flow
That is workin so

Just sittin' here thinkin' about this life of mine
All of my troubles they're my good times
Break it off
Break it up
Break it out
Shout it out

Thrivin' as i'm vibin'
And i'm ridin' high
