This town's so hype it's got soul
As a Philly cat
I'm with the roll
And the swing of my things
How they work like clockwork
Tick tock tick tock
Times always lurking in your head
Got to go to work and get fed
That man didn't eat but he goes to sleep
Gets up at dawn not to see the sunrise
But because it's too damn cold outside
Underneath the bridge they pump the city's bilge
Into the alley sweep the city's filth
Flowers wilt, the flowers wilt
Don't tell me 'bout no game
Cause that is a man
And his family
The revolution family
Look at the family
Yeah, dig the family
They're living the wrong way
Can't get nothing
Don't got nothing all they wanted was
Something like a job (mercy mercy)
But it's been robbed (mercy mercy)
Yeah and there's so many street side
Beggars and disabled veterans
Glass-eyed and peddling
Drunk and just meddling
You conclude it's their fault
They like the street they must like the asphalt
That is man, woman, and children
The system has stalled shelter's home
That's not what I call it
I call it bad health
Some say help themselves
Yo if you gots it, dig
Every hundred people, that's a dollars 'n change
Every hundred people, that's a dollars 'n change

No, no, no...

Yeah...
You know it's rough, had enough for holding a
Cup full of spare change
The doctor diagnosed me as a
Dome full of bad brains
So, toe to toe with employers
Cause they're telling me no
Hooked on prescription drugs
So I stay broke, I'd run away
But you can't run away from
Yourself or your health so
I deal with the cards that I'm dealt
Tweet-a-leet-leet
The morning birds sounding sweet
Though I sleep on the streets
I have a feeling I'm free
Of society's hand picked hypocrisy
(Mercy mercy) don't give a damn for me
(Mercy mercy) now what am I going to eat
Peek through the windows of a restaurant
People eating caviar, fifty bucks on lunch
A hand-me-down meal
Full of god knows what
Put it away in my gut
Quick and then I wonder
Why I'm sick, brick for brick
I know the city like my hand print
Just a pit in the gutter
Of a skid-row ditch
But I'll survive the pain
Lets me know I'm alive
But I still feel that
(This ain't living) This ain't living
(This ain't living) Yeah, this ain't living
(No, this ain't living) This ain't living
(This ain't living)
(This ain't living, no) This ain't living
(This ain't living) This ain't living
(This ain't living, no) This ain't living
(No) this ain't living
(No) (this ain't living)
(No)
(No...)
(No...)

Yo, check my beat dig my rhythm
Me belly full but me hungry so me fill it
Once I start gaining then taxes start taking
Cause the governments perfected funk, fake, 'n
Breaking me down striking me down
What goes around comes around but
I keep rising seeing through the lies and
The surprise comes when I see myself
The music I felt
I'm on
This ain't living
(This ain't living) This ain't living
(No,) this ain't living
(This ain't living)
This ain't living, no
This ain't living
This ain't living
(Oh no) This ain't living, no
Oh (no), this ain't living
(No, no, no) (This ain't living)
(No) This ain't living (This ain't living)
This ain't living
This ain't living
This ain't living
This ain't living
(This ain't living)

I let the people in the streets say
This ain't living
Yeah, I let the peoples in the 'treets say
This ain't living
