Well that's some funky lemonade you got going baby
Is it special for me?
Did you make it today
Cuz I'll always stop by if you like me to
I'll do anything that you could ever want for me to do
A kiss for some of this
A smile and it's done
Miss I'm your mister
My sister's your sister
My mother's your mother father's your father
It all started when I kissed her, I missed her, I did
It was love at first sight, yo, though
Better when it started
I ain't broken hearted but baby
I need some time, some time alone with the crew
To do the stupid things that we used to do
Upon this she slapped me
With a frying pan
Yo, this is love
I'm not gonna leave it

Baby what I would do for just one look in my direction
I gave you all I had but then you still act mad
You don't give me no attention
My baby got sauce and of course as a matter of course
She does what she wants to because she's the boss
Please don't tell my friends about the situation
'Cause, like they think I'm on some extended vacation
'Cause, I don't get out to see my boys anymore
Only time I leave the house is to go to the store for some milk
What she wants what she wants me for
What could she want this time
I'm all hers
No, she ain't even mine, ain't even mine
Believe me what she do at night i dont know but baby
I could guess it ain't right
Coz she got me waiting comes in late and I'm trying not to raise my voice
Negotiating it
I'm confident that she'll win the argument
Shouldn't even started it I'm broken hearted I can't be parted y'all
I need a taste
So I count my loss...
