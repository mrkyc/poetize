Soon you'll know of the great joy we feel
Today day to be able to speak freely
And talk eye to eye
With a small group of americans
We feel that the time has come
For your nation to awaken
To it's true spiritual import
And we wish you everything in our power
To that realization
Four mourning doves searching in the park
Saying don't be confused when the night is dark
Eleven white swans swimming in a black lake
Told me keep it real and you'll find who's fake
Two cedar trees half submerged in the water
Don't prophesize about sons and daughters
One new master of the form tai chi
Friends of the accuser and the accusee
One pimp using songs as his hussy
Won't be here next year to tell you 'bout nothing
Two happy kids playing basketball
Til a war broke out and killed them all
A bunch of ideas like fireflies
An eighteen-year-old girl with stars in her eyes
We saw the gentle trickster on the highway tonight
Keep your mouth closed and your eyes open wide

Shining faces shining faces
May she sleep in peace
And wake up in my arms
Some day soon some day soon
Some day soon some day soon
The separation from unity
Is the descent of the angels upon the ladder of consciousness
The return to unity is the ascent of the angels upon the ladder
The descent is good
But the unity that comes is expressed diversity
But in diversity there would be no concept of separation
Those that were numbered
Had a path to follow
Fly as swift as the swallow
Where no enemies can follow
The path that was laid for the righteous man
Don't promote the fool
Claiming he's the wisest man
As they slander our name in shame
When our aim is to do what comes natural
We're hatchin' the fireflies on a river
Feelin' straght from my toes, knees, kidneys to my liver
Clouds drop down the dew
My friends what about you
Clouds drop down the dew
My friends what about you
Though the roof may leak in many places
Shining faces shining faces
May she sleep in peace
And wake up in my arms
Some day soon some day soon
Some day soon some day soon
Though the roof may leak in many places
Shining faces shining faces
May she sleep in peace
And wake up in my arms
Some day soon some day soon
