I was laughing with some friends
I saw you turn your head
I was checking you instead
I asked you if you would like to dance
I really wasn't trying to get into your pants
Not to say that you're not a beautiful young lady
But I drive a chevy nova
And I thought you liked mercedes
Soon enough though
We were allured
Bumping and grinding out on the dance floor
With the system so loud
The vibrations so pulsing
You whispered in my ear
But I couldn't hear nothing
Steered me over in the corner
And kissed me on the neck
That's when I decided ok what the heck
I put my hands on your hips
And I kissed you right back
You kissed me like a shark
That's sniffing on a snack
And then you said "my boyfriend never kissed me like that"
I said "boyfriend" you didn't say he was around
On this Friday Friday night
When I came and rocked your town
On this Friday night
When the feeling's alright
Rockin rock steady grooves
In the middle of the night
Everything is heated up
And nobody's standing still
With my arm around my girl
And a hundred dollar bill
The song was over
So we headed for a drink
And whatta you think
She gave another guy a wink
Who came over for a kiss
And asked the girl "who's this? "
She said "that's g. love you know g. and special sauce? "
Then he said "I'm getting louie kid you better get lost"
I asked the girl "who's louie? "
And she said "that's my man"
Women women I just can't understand
Then I says "I don't want to hear about girl problems
And if you got a problem babydoll I can solve them"
But I feel you're gonna get me in trouble
So c'mon let's leave this bar
And go out clubbing on the double
Girl's putting me in a trance
All because she wants to dance
And get down with the man
Who brought the sound
On this Friday Friday night
When I came and rocked your town
On this Friday night
When the feeling's alright
Rockin rock steady grooves
In the middle of the night
Everything is heated up
And nobody's standing still
I'm chilling with my girl
And a hundred dollar bill
I can just tell
A girl like you's a deadend
Pressing up against me
Talking about I got a boyfriend
Now here he comes looking for you
On the dance floor
While you're pusing on my knee
Talkin' 'bout I love you more
I'm new in town
Bout I'm no stranger to this
I'm not trying to exit
With a hit and run fix
I get my lvoing on the run
And I like having fun
But I don't sneak around
And I don't gotta gun
Now give me three steps
Like the boy lynyrd skynrd
There's more drama in this room
Than a soap so I figured
Maybe I'll get your digits
And maybe I will call
And maybe we'll slip
Into the backroom down the hall
Or maybe I'll get jacked up
By your angry boyfriend louie
'cause his eyes are getting redder
While his anger's busy stewing on the fire
The little trick in your brought out
On this Friday Friday night
When I came and rocked your town
On this Friday night
Everything is alright
Rock steady grooves
In the middle of the night
Everything is heated up
And nobody's standing still
I chillin' with my girl
