Who's got the weed?
I got the weed
Who's got the weed?
I got the weed
Mamma always used to say, "Hey G, baby
Don't smoke the reefer, it will make you lazy"
I really should have listened
'Cause she might have saved me
But I was too young and I was too, too crazy
But I got so much love for my mother
But still I praised the jay then I pass to it to a brother
'Cause a friend for me is a friend indeed
And I've got plenty of friends that smoked a lotta weed
No seeds, I roll up like a cone, like a tornado
Pass around sucker, we're fast like a hot potato
And then I feel my fingers grip, reality start to slip
(?) Exact same of a huge hit (?)
Of the kind of vapors
Vapors...vapors...vapors
Vapors...vapors...vapors

And we singin'
Who's got the weed?
I got the weed
Who's got the weed?
I got the weed
That Pharcyde crew
See yeah, you know they smoke alot
(?) I know they poke alot
I know they got popped in Japan
By some local cops
It looked like some herbal
But it flows is tight just like Flo Jo
I know he smoked that hydroponic chronic on the low low
And still be claiming its pure
(?) (?)
Graduated from bmv to being wasted
Wasted that you never tasted
Where's the big parties?
Just a little bit more than average
Got spins, lettuce and cabbage
I know they got the papers
So that we can catch the vapors
Freestyle, wake the neighbors
I know he won't forsake us
Dig up some dirt (?)like undertakers
If they don't, lets break 'em off, they got to be
Jesus humble for the pot
I know he's custom to the cake
Just listen to flakes
Pack the crumbs and shake (shake)

Who's got the weed?
I got the weed
Who's got the weed?
I got the weed
Got my grip, grip, keep it next to my hip
I'm going to the airport, I'm going on a trip
I hope I don't get slip by the feds
'Cause I got this house of Buddha right down my leg
That was not cool
It is stinking up the whole damn row
The stewardess is looking at me
I think that she knows
I tried spraying my body with all this cologne
But the stench is creeping into the front row
It's just the homegrown from the backyard
I keep it in my pocket if I go to the bar
So if you want a hit just buy me a drink
And don't worry I've got more of that funky green shh...
Smoke this

And I'm singin'
Who's got the weed?
I got the weed
Who's got the weed?
