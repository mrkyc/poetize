Sweepin' the floors
Open up the doors yeah
Turn on the lights
Gettin' ready for the night
Nobody's romancin'
Cause it's too early for dancin'
But here comes the music
Bright lights flashin'
To cover of your liquor
So many people, so many powers
So many reasons to buy another round drink it down
Just another night on the town
With the big man, money man better than the other man
He got the plan with the million dollars
Give a damn but
When nobody understands
He'll become a smaller man
The bright lights keep flashing
Man the women keep on dancin'
With the clowns yeah, yeah, yeah
Pick me up when I'm down yeah, yeah
Rodeo clowns yeah, yeah, yeah
Pick me up when I'm down
You might also likeThe disco ball spinning
All the music and the women
And the shots of tequila
Man they'll say that they need ya
But what they really need
Is just a little room to breathe
Teeny bopping disco queen
She barely understands her dreams
Of belly button rings
And other kinds of things
Symbolic of change
But the thing that is strange
Is that changes occurred
And now she's just a part of the herd yeah, yeah, yeah
Man I thought that you heard yeah, yeah
The changes occur yeah, yeah, yeah
She's just a part of the herd yeah, yeah
Lights out shut down
Late night wet ground
You walk by, look at him but he can't look at you yeah
You might feel pity but he only feels the ground because
You understand moods
But he only knows let down
By the corner there's another one
Reaching out a hand
Coming from a broken man
Well you try to live
But he's done trying
Not dead but definitely dying
With the rest of the clowns yeah, yeah, yeah
Pick me up when I'm down yeah, yeah
Rodeo clowns yeah, yeah
Pick me up when I'm down
Sweeping the floors
Open up the doors yeah
Turn on the lights
Getting ready for the night
Nobody's romancing 'cause it's too early for dancin'
