Waiting for my lady got the special sauce
That's why she's my baby
My baby
My baby
And of course I'll do anything for her anything she wants
It's sure honey sure
Got a sharp mouth a sharp tongue gimme gimme gimme some
Don't take to that gimme gimme none
You gots to work deserve it earn it to own it
Once you got never ever going to leave it alone don't take wise cracking or
Forgetting never been stood up
She does the stepping
My baby got sauce
Your baby ain't sweet like mine
She got sauce
Your baby ain't sweet like mine
She got sauce
That's some funky lemonade you got going there babe
Is it special for me
Did you make it today
Cause I'll always stop by if you like me to
I'll do anything that you could ever want for me to do
A kiss for some of this
A smile and it's done
Miss I'm your mister
My sister's your sister
My mother's your mother father's your father
It all started when I kissed her I missed her, dig
It was love at first sight
Better when it started
I ain't broken hearted but baby
I need some time alone with the crew to do the stupid things that we used to do
Upon this she slapped me
With a frying pan
This is love, I'm not gonna leave it

Your baby ain't sweet like mine
Baby what I would do for just one look in my direction
I gave you all I had, but then you still act mad
You don't give me no attention
My baby's got sauce and of course as a matter of course
She does what she wants to cause she's the boss
Please don't tell my friends about the situation
They think I'm on some extended vacation
I don't get out to see my boys anymore
Only time I leave the house is to go to the store
For what she wants what she
Wants what she wants me for
What could she want this time
I'm all hers
She ain't even hardly mine
Believe me what she do at night I don't know
I could guess it ain't right
She got me waiting comes in late and I'm trying not to raise my voice
Negotiating it
She'll win the argument
Shouldn't even started it I'm broken hearted I can't be parted
I need a taste
So I count my loss mmmmm
