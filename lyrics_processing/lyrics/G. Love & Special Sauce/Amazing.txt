Hidden track on philadelphonic
Yeah
When I woke up this morning
I heard this groove in my head
Then I had to get these words out
And this is what I said
Take out the trash
And clean up the litter
I'm sneaky like a critter
All that is gold is not glitter
Not all those who wander are lost...
I'm going to blow up just like the california gold rush
Give us faith, guidance and love
We'll be silent as a rock and fly like a dove
When I say my grace the sound is amazing
I said when I say my grace the sound is amazing
The cows are grazing
The sunlight is fading
Even the darkest flame must come to light
In the morning I'm learning to never stop yearning
And burnin' to get to higher elevation
Music the name of my lovely occupation
Want to spread this grove all over the nation
When I say my grace the sound is amazing
Its amazing
When I say my grace the sound is amazing
Amazing
Amazing
Amazing

Yo the suns come up just for you
Raise up your voice and shout clear and true
I want to sing like a turtle dove
Hiss like a clip
Wrap it up like a spliff
Smoke it like a gift
Here is the sequal I'm sweeter than equal
More like honey you know I'm on the money
I'm the wizard of lemonade
I might burn out but you know i'll never fade
The pressure never last
Bust another funky track
Pass the phillys to my brother
Never ask for it back
I'm never too busy man i'll be back soon
Chilling in the night like the man on the moon
When I say my grace the sound is amazing
Amazing
Yeah
When I say my grace the sound is amazing
Amazing
Yo when I say my grace the sound is amazing
Amazing
When I say my grace the sound is amazing
Amazing
Rattlesnakes watch the vipers and adders
Climbing down hills and climbing up rock ladders
Everything is everything and everything matters
Yeah
When I say my grace the sound is amazing
Mmm
And when I say my grace the sound is amazing
