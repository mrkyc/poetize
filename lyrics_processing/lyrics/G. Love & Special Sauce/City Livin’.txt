City livin', lalalala
City livin' is so tough
Scrubbing floors on your hands and knees
City livin' can get so hot when
It's a hundred and three degrees
City livin' can make you mean
Please don't stand so close to me
Franky's got a dream that's gonna get him paid
Jenny said, "Don't forget me, babe"
City livin', lalalala
City livin', lalalala
Tony's making calls
Swinging 50 bags and E's in the parking lot
Parking cars, working for tips
He said, "These rich mothersuckers don't give me zip"
Christina's in the back of the limousine
Working all day for the agency
About to go party till the sun comes up
And that same old song is keeping her up

What you gonna do when the sun don't shine on you?
What you gonna do when the sun don't shine on you?
You just keep on shining through
You just keep on shining through
Keep on shining through, yeah
You just keep on shining through
Now Ty is washing dishes at some fancy restaurant
And his check sure ain't stretching too far
'Cause he got too much month for the end of the money
And not enough money for the end of the month
M.J. and Red are running the clubs
Making the scene every night
Bottles and tables for the fellas and honey's
And damn these girls are fine
But Louis don't know much about that
Delivering groceries from the corner store
Sending some money back to Mexico
So that his kids ain't sleeping on the floor
City livin', lalalala

What you gonna do when the sun don't shine on you?
What you gonna do when the sun don't shine on you?
You just keep on shining through
Just keep on shining through, yeah
