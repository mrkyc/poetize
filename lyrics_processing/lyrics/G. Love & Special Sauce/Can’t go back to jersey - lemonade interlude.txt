I'm infected with your love I need some Bacitracin
Please don't kick me out on the streets out the door
I don't want to stay on my cousin's couch no more
I can't do it I can't go back to livin' that way
Sweet sweet sugar momma
I know that I can change
I won't do the shit that piss you off and make you mad
Like running late to dinner with your business friends
Or being out late night with the fellas at the club
Or the time I forgot your birthday cuZ I's at the studio
And I will try to be a little more sensitive
Because I love you baby boo boo
And I need a place to live
I Can't go back to Jersey
I ain't goin' back
I Can't go back to Jersey
I ain't goin' back
I Can't go back to Jersey
I ain't goin' back
Why ya Why ya Why ya
Gotta do me like that?
I Can't go back to Jersey
I ain't goin' back

Yo, I got a message from my girl who was furious and cryin
She said who was that chick you were speakin with last night
Now stop lying
Oh no! What can I do I'm against the wall
While I was flirting with this honey
I made a pocket call
For 15 minutes she heard me layin it on thick
Now she's got the kitchen knife and she's staring at the dilsnick
Nothing happened
I didn't touch her, didn't even smile, didn't even fuck her
Didn't grind for a little while
Didn't even laugh, buy a drink or hold her hand
She slapped me in the face
And said pack your shit man!

Like dat, and you don't stop...
You know I'm squirmin' tryin' to get back in good graces
I keep layin'it on thick tripping on my shoelaces
I really love you, I rub a dub you
I fill the tub with bubbles on the double
Oh shit I'm in trouble
Buy you flowers cook you dinner
I hope my friends
Don't see you running me 'round like Bruce Jenner
That would not be cool it might ruin my rep
And my main objective is to keep the bed where we slept
Last night and the night before last
Gotta solve this problem fast
Move past this situation
I really should've had my phone on lock
Cause she just threw all of my shit
Out the window on the block
I Can't go back to Jersey
I ain't goin' back
I Can't go back to Jersey
I ain't goin' back
