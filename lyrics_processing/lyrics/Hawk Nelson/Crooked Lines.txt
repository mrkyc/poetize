Every time I couldn't choke back the tears
Every time I couldn't fight off my fears
You were paving the path that brought me
Paving the path that brought me here
Every time I couldn't just disappear
And I felt my future was so unclear
You were paving the path that brought me
You were paving the path that brought me here

I walked a windy road that led me back to You
I took a twisted path that let me straight to You
And when I look behind
I see your grace in every crooked line

Even when I ran to places I thought
That your mercy simply would never go
You were paving the path that brought me
Paving the path that brought me home
And even when I traded Your Love for my pride to protect the hurt I carry inside
You were paving the path that saved me
Paving the path that saved my life

I walked a windy road that led me back to You
I took a twisted path that let me straight to You
And when I look behind
I see Your Grace in every crooked line
You might also like
You're lifting me up where my hope is found
You're lifting me up take my feet off the ground
Salvation is a song singing over me now
I know I don't deserve it
I know I couldn't earn it

I walked a windy road that led me back to You
I took a twisted path that let me straight to You
And when I look behind
I see Your Grace oh
I walked a windy road that led me back to You
I took a twisted path that let me straight to You
And when I look behind
I see Your Grace oh
When I look behind
I see Your grace in every crooked line
In every crooked line
When I look behind I see Your grace
