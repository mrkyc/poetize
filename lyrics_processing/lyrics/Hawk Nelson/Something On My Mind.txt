Take the train
Go separate ways
And leave it long forgotten
I'll hang my head, and
I won't be back
On my way out
I'm feeling lame
Am i to blame?
Or am i just too jaded?
And i won't be back
Whatcha think of that?
When it feels like life's racing away
I can say.. that when
There's something on my mind
It takes my concentration
Just wanna lay it on the line
Avoid all confrontation
I'm gonna say this one more time
For all my generation
You'll never, ever pull my lever
Not today and not forever
(not today and not forever)
You might also likeTake the fame
And change my name
Because my jacket's faded
And i'll change my head
No we can't have that
(you'll be looking at a brand new gap(?))
It's all made up
I've had enough
Of this circulation
If you write me back
I'll tell you where its at
When it feels like life's racing away
I can say.. that when
There's something on my mind
It takes my concentration
Just wanna lay it on the line
Avoid all confrontation
I'm gonna say this one more time
For all my generation
You'll never, ever pull my lever
Not today and not forever
Something on my mind
It takes my concentation
Just wanna lay it on the line
Avoid all confronation
I'm gonna say this one more time
You'll never, ever pull my lever
Not today and not forever
(not today and not forever)
*instrumental break*
Something on my mind
It takes my concentration
Just wanna lay it on the line
Avoid all confrontation
I'm gonna say this one more time
For all my generation
You'll never, ever pull my lever
Not today and not forever
Something on my concentration
Just wanna lay it on the line
Avoid all confrontation
I'm gonna say this one more time
For all my generation
You'll never, ever pull my lever
