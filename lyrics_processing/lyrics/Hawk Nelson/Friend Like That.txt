I'm not a superman
I never said that I was more than that
I'm not a wannabe
I'm who I wanna be
And I intend to be
How you created me
I, I need
Somebody on the inside
I, I want
Somebody who can set me free
I'm not
The only one who feels like this
I've got
A few others around me
Hey
Hey
Let me hear you say
Make some noise if you feel this way
Hey
If you've got a friend like that
Hey
Let's scream and shout
If you know what I'm talkin' about
Anybody got a friend like that?
You might also likeI once was little and
I always had a plan
You thought my friendliness was just an act
Hey
I'll be your friend indeed
And you can count on me
And I can guarantee
Your friend I'll always be
Hey
I, I need
Somebody on the inside
I, I want
Somebody who can set me free
I'm not
The only one who feels like this
I've got
A few others around me
Hey
Hey
Let me hear you say
Make some noise if you feel this way
Hey
If you've got a friend like that
Hey
Let's scream and shout
If you know what I'm talkin' about
Anybody got a friend like that?
Does anyone out there feel alone?
Can anyone hear me?
Whoa, whoa
Down and out your heart is cold
It's never easy
Whoa, whoa
But if you believe that there is hope
Then sing it with me
Hey
Let me hear you say
Make some noise if you feel this way

Let's scream and shout
If you know what I'm talkin' about
Anybody got a friend like that?
