Everybody in the world moving so fast
Can't find relief
Looking for relief
But I'm throwing my cares from the East to the West
Cause you care for me
You care for me
Why would I let all these troubles come steal my joy
When I know you hold my future you're in control

I say no more, no more wasting a moment worrying about my life, my life
Carried in your love God I know I got no burdens dragging me down
My soul is lifted cause you're holding me now
I give it all to you and I'm weightless
I gave it all to you and I'm weightless

Every bit of my stress that I keep inside
I lay it at your feet
And now I'm care free
So I'm walking through the heavy feeling light
A new reality
But different gravity
Why would I let all these troubles come steal my joy
When I know you hold my future you're in control
You might also like
I say no more, no more wasting a moment worrying about my life, my life
Carried in your love God I know I got no burdens dragging me down
My soul is lifted cause you're holding me now
I give it all to you and I'm weightless
I gave it all to you and I'm weightless

Carried over troubled waters
I'm safe in the arms of my father
I'm carried over troubles waters
I'm safe in the arms of my father
Oh I'm carried over troubled waters
I'm safe in the arms of my father, oh

I say no more, no more wasting a moment worrying about my life, my life
Carried in your love God I know I got no burdens dragging me down
My soul is lifted cause you're holding me now
I give it all to you and I'm weightless
I gave it all to you and I'm weightless

You life me up, higher and higher
You life me up, higher and higher
And I'm weightless
Yeah you lift me up, higher and higher
You life me up, higher and higher
