(Count on You)
(Count on You)
(Count on You)
(I can count on)

Next to me, next to me
You are always next to me
When I'm needing You
Needing You the most
Holding on, holding on
For my dear life, I'm holding on
To You alone
Cause You alone are my hope

And I've had front row seats to Your faithfulness
A spotlight shining on Your promises
So I can't deny
'Cause I've seen it a thousand times

I can count on You (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I can count on You (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Like a parachute when I fall
A lifeline when I call
You come through and prove it's true
I can count on You
I can count on
You might also like
Every word You said to me
You hold the future I can't see
So I believe no matter where I go

You give me front row seats to Your faithfulness
A spotlight shining on Your promises
So I can't deny
'Cause It's written all over my life

I can count on You (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I can count on You (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Like a parachute when I fall
A lifeline when I call
You come through and prove it's true
I can count on You
I can count on

You when my strength's not enough
You when I'm looking for love
You when I'm standing on the edge
And I've got nothing left
I've got front row seats to Your faithfulness
A spotlight shining on Your promises
And I can't deny
You've shown me time after time that

I can count on You (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I can count on You (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Like a parachute when I fall
A lifeline when I call
You come through
And prove it's true
I can count on You
I can count on You
I can count on You
