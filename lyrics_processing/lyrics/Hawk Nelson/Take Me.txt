Can you hear me?
Does anyone around me
Feel the way that I feel now?
Cause from the window where I sometimes cry
I just want to see Your face tonight
And I'm willing to lose everything I am

'Cause I need You more than ever
I need Your help to find where I've been going wrong so far
Take me under Your wing tonight
Make me so perfect in Your eyes
Hold on 'cause it will be alright
You're not alone

When You're near me, I feel like I just found me
In the traces of the boy from yesterday
But in a world that is so black and white
I will take the steps to change my life
And I won't be coming back to here again
I need Your loving hand to guide me
Through the maze of all the things inside me
Then I'll know that I'm alright
You might also like
'Cause I need You more than ever
I need Your help to find where I'll be going wrong so far
Take me under Your wing tonight
Make me so perfect in Your eyes
Hold on 'cause it will be alright
You're not alone

Please help me get from worse to better
Before these tears soak through this lonely sweater
And let me know that I'm alright
I still have one strike of this match left
And I'm holding on to my last breath
And its getting a little dark around to see here

Take me under Your wing tonight
Make me so perfect in your eyes
Hold on 'cause it will be alright
You're not alone
Take me under Your wing tonight
Make me so perfect in your eyes
Hold on it will be alright
You're not alone
And You'll be here forever, forever You'll stay
And You promised to love me, You'll love me always
You'll love me for always, You'll love me for always
