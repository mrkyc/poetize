I've been wrestling with my thoughts, I've been searching for daylight
Tryin' to make sense of the mess, tryin' to feel like I'm alright
All these questions without answers
Feelin' restless and abandoned

Will You hear my call?
Will You be there when I fall?
You say...

All of this time and I've never let you down
I carried you then, I'll carry you here and now
So don't lose heart and don't forget
My work in you ain't finished yet
Hold on to me now, I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I won't let you down
Believe in me, I won't let you down
Ne-ver let you down
Let you down, let you down

Oh, I've seen You showing up in the darkest of places
In the moments of my doubt, in the tears that I've tasted
Would You take me, take me this far?
Just to leave me, that's not who You are
You might also like
I know You hear my call
You're always there when I fall
You say...

All of this time and I've never let you down
(I've never let you down)
I carried you then, I'll carry you here and now
(I'll carry you here and now)
So don't lose heart and don't forget
My work in you ain't finished yet
Hold on to me now, I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I won't let you down
Believe in me, I won't let you down
Ne-ver let you down
I'll never let you down
I won't let you down
Believe in me, I won't let you down
Ne-ver let you down
Let you down, let you down

Caught in chaos, I'm knee deep
Wrestling with all of my disbelief
In this moment, I hear You speak
Break through the noise and consume me!
I change with the seasons, I lose sight of faith
When my hope is gone, I know that You stay the same
Your gentle whisper, a familiar sound
I know You won't let me down...
All of this time and I've never let you down
(I've never let you down)
I carried you then, I'll carry you here and now
(I'll carry you here and now)
So don't lose heart and don't forget
My work in you ain't finished yet
Hold on to me now, I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
...
I won't let you down
Believe in me, I won't let you down
Ne-ver let you down
I'll never let you down
I won't let you down
Believe in me, I won't let you down
Ne-ver let you down
I'll never let you down!
I'll never let you down!
