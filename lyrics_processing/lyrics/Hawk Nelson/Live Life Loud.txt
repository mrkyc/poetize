If you wanna take a chance, then
You gotta sing a little louder
Let's wake this crowd up
Someone throw your hands up
If you wanna take a chance, then
You gotta sing a little louder
Let's wake this crowd up
I got a hankerin' for something special
Tonight's the night it becomes official
Don't stop the rock, hold both your hands up
Show these people how to shake things up
I'm not sittin' down 'til I'm older
And I'm not shuttin' up 'til it's over
Raise your hands and shout if you're with me
Once we start, it won't make a difference
If you wanna live life loud, throw your hands up
If you wanna scream and shout, lemme hear you
Takin' all the fakers out if you're with me
Everybody work it, just keep living
I started figurin' with good intentions
Listen up now, give me your attention
Don't make a sound if you don't believe me
We'll wake up and just keep living
You might also likeI'm not sittin' down 'til I'm older
And I'm not shuttin' up 'til it's over
Raise your hands and shout if you're with me
Once we start, it won't make a difference
If you wanna live life loud, throw your hands up
If you wanna scream and shout, lemme hear you
Takin' all the fakers out if you're with me
Everybody work it, just keep living
Every time when I close my eyes
I catch a glimpse of the west coast sunrise
And I can tell you you're just as beautiful
Someone throw your hands up
If you wanna take a chance, then
You gotta sing a little louder
Let's wake this crowd up
Someone throw your hands up
If you wanna take a chance, then
You gotta sing a little louder
Let's wake this crowd up
If you wanna live life loud, throw your hands up
If you wanna scream and shout, lemme hear you
Takin' all the fakers out if you're with me
Everybody work it, just keep living
