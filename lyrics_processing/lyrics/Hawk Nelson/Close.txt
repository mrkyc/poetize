Does anybody see you
Does anybody feel your pain
Does anybody know you
Does anybody feel the same
Does anybody want you
Is there a place you belong
Does anybody love you
Oh maybe it's been so long
I'm telling you that you are not alone

He is close
Closer than the beat of your heart
Closer than the beat of your heart
I promise you that he is right where you are
He is close
Closer than the fears you fight
Closer than the heart you hide
Closer than the tears you're holding inside
He is close
He is close

You are not abandoned
Even on your darkest night
You are not forsaken
He will never leave your sight
I'm telling you that you are not alone
You might also like
He is close
Closer than the beat of your heart
Closer than the beat of your heart
I promise you that he is right where you are
He is close
Closer than the fears you fight
Closer than the heart you hide
Closer than the tears you're holding inside
He is close
He is close

And He runs to the ones who are heavy hearted
Yeah He runs to the ones who are heavy hearted
He is close
Closer than the air that you breathe
Closer than the secrets you keep
Closer than you thought anyone could be

Close
Closer than the beat of your heart
Closer than the beat of your heart
I promise you that he is right where you are
He is close
Closer than the fears you fight
Closer than the heart you hide
Closer than the tears you're holding inside
He is close
He is close
And he runs to the ones who are heavy hearted
Yeah he runs to the ones who are heavy hearted
