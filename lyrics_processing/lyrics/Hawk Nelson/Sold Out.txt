I'm running for the front
When they're all running for the door
And I won't sit down won't back out
You can't ever shut me up
Cause I'm on a mission
And I won't quit now
In a world full of followers
I'll be a leader
In a world full of doubters
I'll be a believer
I'm stepping out without a hesitation
Because the battle's already been won
I'm sold out
I'm no longer living
Just for myself
Running after Jesus
With my whole heart
And now I'm ready to show
I am sold out
I'm sold out
With every single
Step that I take now
With every drop of blood
Left in my veins
I'm gonna be making it count
I am sold out

You can't face this kind of grace
And leave the way you came
This is permanent with intent
And there won't be no stopping it now
I'm on a mission and it's heaven sent
In a world full of followers
I'll be a leader
In a world full of doubters
I'll be a believer
I'm stepping out without a hesitation
Cause my soul is like a stadium
I'm sold out
I'm no longer living
Just for myself
Running after Jesus
With my whole heart
And now I'm ready to show
I am sold out
I'm sold out
With every single
Step that I take now
With every drop of blood
Left in my veins
I'm gonna be making it count
I am sold out
No trials coming against me
Could put a dent in my passion
They're just an opportunity
To put my faith into action
In a world full of followers
I'll be a leader
In a world full of doubters
I'll be a believer
I'm stepping out without a hesitation
I ain't got nothing left to be afraid
I'm sold out
I'm no longer living
Just for myself
Running after Jesus
With my whole heart
And now I'm ready to show
I am sold out
I'm sold out
With every single
Step that I take now
With every drop of blood
Left in my veins
I'm gonna be making it count
