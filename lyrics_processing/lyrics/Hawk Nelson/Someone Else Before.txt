I think its my girlfriend
This time i know that its finally over
She keeps bringing me down
Will this all turn around
Right now i feel like i am slow - ly dying
You know i've heard it all before
And now my eyes they run like faucets
Until my tears are dry
She said we were in love
I take a sip of my water
I guess we'll carry on at last
She still thinks its my fault
And i'm nobody at all
She must of thought i was someone else before
Whoa - o, whoa - o, whoa - o, whoa!
I'm not so special now
I always knew it somehow
I guess she never had guts to tell me
Is it my spiked blonde hair?
The fact that my chest is bare?
Or that my wardrobe is all in black? its all in black, its all in black
You want me back -- well i won't be back
You might also likeBecause you're always keeping score
But now the scorecard's in my pocket
And now the match is won
She said we were in love
I take a sip of my water
I guess we'll carry on at last
She still thinks its my fault
And i'm nobody at all
She must of thought i was someone else before
