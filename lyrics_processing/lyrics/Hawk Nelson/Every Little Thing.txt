I saw her yesterday
And I've never I felt the feeling
Like the one I felt today
And now, it's taking over me
I've never met anyone like you
Cuz I never could find the words to write you

She's been on my mind (she's working overtime)
She's got perfect reasons
Says she loves to talk to Jesus
I think I believe her when she says
"Life could be so simple if we'd all just learn to pray"

She's got every little thing I wanted
And it still feels just like the day it started
I'll say good bye to the broken-hearted
And I could never
Express the way I felt before tonight

She sits there all alone
She's reading from the chapter
That she sometimes calls her own
And now, she's taking over me
This girl I once rejected
Has now become the girl of my dreams
You might also like
She's got every little thing I wanted
And it still feels just like the day it started
I'll say good bye to the broken-hearted
And I could never express the way
I felt before tonight

She's not an ordinary girl
I can see it in her eyes
I'm just an ordinary boy
God must have heard my prayers last night

She's been on my mind
She's working overtime
She's got perfect reason's
Says she loves to talk to Jesus
I think I believe her when she says
"Life could be so simple if we'd all just learn to pray"

Every little thing I wanted
And it still feels just like the day it started
So say goodbye to the broken-hearted
And I could never express the way
I felt before tonight
She's not an ordinary girl
I can see it in her eyes
I'm just an ordinary boy
