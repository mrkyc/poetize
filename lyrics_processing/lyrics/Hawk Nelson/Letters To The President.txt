When we were younger
We used to sit on my porch
And talk smack about
Girls and professional sports
There's a lot of
Things I wanted to say
But never got a
Chance to find a way

(One) take a good look at all of our high schools
This is the first reason that I want to write you
It must be tough when society is messed up
Gotta save money, please don't take it out on us
Do they even know?
Do they even know?

If I was brave I'd write a letter to the president
And have him pass it to the leaders of our parliament
But for now I
Won't say nothing
From all the kids who would stand in my residence
Who see this letter as a statement of our innocence
But for now I
Won't say nothing
You might also like
Now that we're older
A brand new story unfolds
About God and the
Laws that we've always been told
And there's a lot of
Things I wanted to say
But never got a
Chance to find a way

(Same) Sex marriage in a state where they don't care
Murder is wrong but the jail time's not fair
Not to mention date rape, felony and car theft
Break it down and tell me what we've got left
Do they even know?
Do they even know?

If I was brave I'd write a letter to the president
And have him pass it to the leaders of our parliament
But for now I
Won't say nothing
From all the kids who would stand in my residence
Who see this letter as a statement of our innocence
As for now I'll
Start with something
Take a good look at Tommy, he's a track star
Role model, has a chance to go real far
Then the school made a budget cut
Cut out the track team
Now instead Tommy is a crack head

Same sex marriage in a state where they don't care
Murder is wrong but the jail time's not fair
Not to mention date rape, felony, and car theft
Break it down and tell me what we've got left

If I was brave I'd write a letter to the president
And have him pass it to the leaders of out parliament
But for now I won't say nothing
From all the kids who would stand in my residence
Who see this letter as a statement of our innocence
As for now I'll start with something
