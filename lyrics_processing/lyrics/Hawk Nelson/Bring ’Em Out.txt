All the girls and the boys
And people making noise
Just let me hear you shout
Bring 'em out! Bring 'em out!
Pump up your fist
If you twist like this
'Til the lights go out
Bring 'em out! Bring 'em out!
Katie
I don't know why I even try
Cause lately
You're always out with other guys
Pretty baby
Don't you know I'll treat you right
I'll go crazy
If you pass me up tonight
Hey - Hey - Hey Hey!
Hey - Hey - Hey Hey Hey!
All this time can't get it off my mind
Dance the night away
(Keep rocking with me)
When the grooves all right
Rocking all night
I want to hear you say

Wake up
I'm calling you up I need a ride
We're gonna shake up
So hurry it up no wasted time
The girls in their makeup
In black and white
Exchanging looks tonight
I just ran into some other friends of mine
Someone's coming 'round to pick them up at nine
Hey - Hey - Hey Hey!

All this time can't get it off my mind
Dance the night away
Keep Rocking with me

Dance the night away
Keep Rocking with me
When the grooves alright
Rocking all night
Shake it shake it up until we break it
We won't stop till we just can't take it
Everybody move to the beat
Come on
Everybody move to the beat
Come on
Everybody rock to the break of dawn
Everybody else just sing along
Go!
All this time can't get it off my mind
Dance the night away
When the grooves alright
Rocking all night
