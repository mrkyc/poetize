If you're tired of running in circles
Feeling like all your plans
Are slipping right through your hands
If you got troubles deep as an ocean
Trying to breathe again
But worries keep sinking in
Just lift up your eyes to the sky
You will find there's freedom on the other side
For you and I

I'm telling you there's no such thing as hopeless for a believer (A believer, a believer)
There's no such thing as broken for our Redeemer (Our redeemer, our redeemer)
There's no war He can't win
No fear He can't face
No hurt that He can't heal
No soul He can't save
There's no such thing as hopeless for a believer (Believer)
No such thing!

When it feels like you've heard it before
But you haven't seen it yet
You're still in the thick of it
There is an invitation to be a new creation
So let your soul awaken (Oh, oh, oh)
Let your soul awaken (Oh, oh, oh)

There's no such thing as broken for our Redeemer (A redeemer)
Don't you know there's no such thing
There's no war He can't win
No fear He can't face
No hurt He can't heal
No soul He can't save
There's no such thing as hopeless for a believer (A believer)
No such thing!

Just lift up your eyes
There's freedom on the other side
Just lift up your eyes
There's freedom on the other side
For you and I

I'm telling you there's no such thing as hopeless for a believer (A believer, a believer)
