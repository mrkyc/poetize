Feelin' like you lose more than you win
Like life is just an endless hill you climb
You try and try, but never arrive
I'm tellin' you somethin'
This racing, this running
Oh, you're working way too hard!
And this perfection you're chasing
Is just energy wasted
'cause He loves you like you are!
So go ahead and live like you're loved
It's ok to act like you've been set free
His love has made you more than enough
So go ahead and be who he made you to be
And live like you're loved
Live like you're loved
Live like you're loved
Live like you're loved
And live like you're know you're valuable
Like you know the one that hold your soul
'Cause mercy has called you by your name
Don't be afraid to live in that grace
You might also likeI'm tellin' you somethin'
This God we believe in
Yeah, he changed everything
No more guilt! No more shame!
He took all that away
Gave us a reason to sing
So go ahead and live like you're loved
It's ok to act like you've been set free
His love has made you more than enough
So go ahead and be who he made you to be
And live like you're loved
Live like you're loved
Live like you're loved
Live like you're loved
Live like you're loved, walk like you're free
Stand like you know who he made you to be
Live like you're loved, like you believe
His love is all that you'll ever need
So go ahead and live like you're loved
His love has made you more than enough
So go ahead and live like you're loved
It's ok to act like you've been set free
His love has made you more than enough
So go ahead and be who he made you to be
And live like you're loved
Live like you're loved
Live like you're loved
Live like you're loved
Live like you're loved, walk like you're free
Stand like you know who he made you to be
Live like you're loved, like you believe
His love is all that you'll ever need
