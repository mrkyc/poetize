He never wanted to be just like his dad was
He was a dreamer but he had never had none
Who made the most of his life but never had one
He was a single boy he could never slow down
He always wanted to leave but didn't know how
He was a dreamer who seemed to never break ground
Who spent most of his life in a small town
Shake up my life
Let's go...
Back to the days when we were young and all restless
We still believed in having built up offenses
I'll tell you one things for sure
Till we make the decision
We'll never take this world
Unless we make a head on collision
A head on collision
And daddy told her she could never have
Late night out with her man
So she sits crying by the window
Every time she gets another A
She makes it another day
And it's just that simple
You might also likeShake up my life
Let's go...
Back to the days when we were young and all restless
We still believed in having built up offenses
I'll tell you one things for sure
Till we make the decision
We'll never take this world
Unless we make a head on collision
A head on collision
Here they come now
Will you come down?
Make 'em run now
On to the next town
Here they come now
Let's make 'em run now
No time to fake now
Everything breaks down
Here they come now
Will you come down?
Make 'em run now
On to the next town
Here they come now
Let's make 'em run now
No time to fake now
Everything breaks down
He was a simple boy he just liked to have fun
He never wanted to be just like his dad was
He was a dreamer but he had never had none
Who made the most of his life but never had one
Here they come now
Will you come down?
Make 'em run now
On to the next town
Let's go...
Back to the days when we were young and all restless
We still believed in having built up offenses
I'll tell you one things for sure
Till we make the decision
We'll never take this world
Unless we make a head on collision
Let's go...
Back to the days when we were young and all restless
We still believed in having built up offenses
I'll tell you one things for sure
Till we make the decision
We'll never take this world
Unless we make a head on collision
Don't you know
There's more to this than we thought
'cause we were never listening
We heard it all before but we missed it
When all we needed was a head on collision
Don't you know
There's more to this than we thought
'cause we were never listening
We heard it all before but we missed it
