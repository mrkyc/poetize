It's a crime, you let it happen to me
Never mind, I let it happen to you
I don't mind, forget it; there's nothing to lose
But my mind and all the things I wanted

Every time I get it, throw it away
It's a sign, I get it; I wanna stay
By the time I lose it, I'm not afraid
I'm alive, but I can surely fake it

How can I believe
When this cloud hangs over me?
You're the part of me
That I don't wanna see

Forget it, forget it, forget it
Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it
Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it
Forget it, forget it, forget it

There's a place I see you follow me
Just a taste of all that might come to be
I'm alone, but holding breath you can breathe
To question every answer counted

Just fade away (Forget it, forget it, forget it)
Please let me stay (Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it)
Caught in your way (Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it)
Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it
Just fade away (Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it)
Please let me stay (Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it)

It's a crime you let it happen to me
I don't mind, I love it, easy to please
Never mind, forget it; just memory
On a page inside a spiral notebook

Just fade away
Please let me stay
Caught in your way
I can live forever here
Just fade away (Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it)
Please let me stay (Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it)
Caught in your way (Forget it, forget it)

When this cloud hangs over me?
You're the part of me
(Forget it, forget it)
That I don't wanna see
