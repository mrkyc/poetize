Just because I don't have a diamond ring
Doesn't mean i'm gonna be your dirty fling
I'm just dancing with my girls on a Friday night
Don't need you buyin' me a drink to have a good ol' time

I know that you want to take me home
You wanna take a little drive just to get me alone
But I'm a good girl, Mama taught me watch my back
I gotta stay away from boys who play like that
'Cause there's no such thing as a free ride
Goodnight

I've heard those lame lines way too much
You can look all you want but you can't touch
Don't tell me about your tricked out four wheel drive
I can see just what is on your mind

I know that you want to take me home
You wanna take a little drive just to get me alone
But I'm a good girl, Mama taught me watch my back
I gotta stay away from boys who play like that
'Cause there's no such thing as a free ride
Goodnight
You might also like
Hey, maybe you're stuck livin' in a dream
Or some kind of wicked fantasy
I know that you want what you can't see
Got news for you: That'll never be
Sorry, pretty boy, but you're out of luck
I'm never gonna jump in the back of your truck
Go try your tricks on another one
If that's what you want then back up
Back up

I know that you want to take me home
You wanna take a little drive just to get me alone (just to get me alone)
But I'm a good girl, Mama taught me watch my back
I gotta stay away from boys who play like that
I know that you want to take me home
You wanna take a little drive just to get me alone
But I'm a good girl, Mama taught me watch my back
I gotta stay away from boys who play like that
'Cause there's no such thing as a free ride
Goodnight
Goodnight
'Cause there's no such thing as a free ride
