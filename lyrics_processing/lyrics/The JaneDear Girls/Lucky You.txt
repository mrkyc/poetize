She don't like ridin' on the back of your motorbike
She made you sell it
And she thinks football games are just a waste of time
She's just jealous
Traded me in for a Barbie doll girl
Now you want to come back to the real world

Our love didn't matter
Yeah, you had to have her
Well, boy you can have her
La, la, lucky you
Don't get it?
Well, now you're stuck with it
You might as well forget it
La, la, lucky you

Remember last fall when you helped me shoot my first buck?
She won't eat red meat
Or when we went camping and we came home covered in mud?
She don't get dirty
She can do some damage with your credit card
How's that addin' up for ya so far?

Our love didn't matter
Yeah, you had to have her
Well, boy you can have her
La, la, lucky you
Don't get it?
Well, now you're stuck with it
You might as well forget it
La, la, lucky you

I was always there for you
Nothin' that I wouldn't do
'Til you broke my heart in two, baby
You say she's just a drama queen
You wanna come and be with me
You're beggin' down on your knees
Please!

Our love didn't matter
Yeah, you had to have her
Well, boy you can have her
La, la, lucky you
Don't get it?
Well, now you're stuck with it
You might as well forget it
La, la, lucky you
Our love didn't matter
Yeah, you had to have her
Well, boy you can have her
La, la, lucky you
Don't get it?
Well, now you're stuck with it
You might as well forget it

Yeah, yeah, yeah-eh-eah
