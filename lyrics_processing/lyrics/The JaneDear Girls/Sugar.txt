I'm like a kid at the candy shop
I see what I want but the door is locked
And you don't even know I'm lookin'
Over there hangin' with all your friends
But you're gonna see me walkin' in
And this time you ain't gonna miss me

'Cause I'm comin', I'm comin' over
I'm gettin' closer, game over

Sugar, you're gonna want it
(Sugar) you're gonna need it
Wait 'til you see how good this is
(Sugar) you're gonna feel it
(Sugar) you're gonna get it
Right there, smack dab on your lips
A sweet little innocent, tiny taste of peppermint
You're the one I want kind of kiss
I want (she wants), I want, I want sugar
From you

Boy, I'm setting my sights on you
And you can bet by the time I'm through
You're not gonna know what hit ya
You might also like
'Cause I'm comin', I'm comin' over
I'm gettin' closer, game over

Sugar, you're gonna want it
(Sugar) you're gonna need it
Wait 'til you see how good this is
(Sugar) you're gonna feel it
(Sugar) you're gonna get it
Right there, smack dab on your lips
A sweet little innocent, tiny taste of peppermint
You're the one I want kind of kiss
I want (she wants), I want, I want sugar
From you
That's right
Sugar from you

You're gonna crave it
You can't resist it
You gotta have it
Why don't ya taste it?

Sugar, you're gonna want it
(Sugar) you're gonna need it
Wait 'til you see how good this is
(Sugar) you're gonna feel it
(Sugar) you're gonna get it
Right there, smack dab on your lips
A sweet little innocent, tiny taste of peppermint
You're the one I want kind of kiss
I want (she wants), I want, I want sugar
I want (she wants), I want, I want sugar
