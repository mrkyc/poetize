Tandy with the good hand, stutters when she's speaking
Johnny drives a big rig, Johnny's not sleeping
Sweet Geraldine turned 80 in the spring
But her nerves won't quit, she worries about everything
Sara's on a work trip crying at a hotel
Jessie's doing backflips, Molly's doing so well
Joey's got a new girl, Emily moved away
And the world's on fire
The whole time we're trying to put out the flame

Life, it gets louder now
Can't stop it, won't slow down
Lost in this, all I can do
Is keep my eyes on you

I know the world turns around
I know the lights are gonna go out
But until they do, I've got nothing to lose
I keep my eyes on you, I
I keep my eyes on you

Tommy took a freefall, didn't pull the ripcord
Gathered at the funeral, everybody looked bored
Amanda had a baby, Katie, she lost a few
And when the smoke gets thick
I can't help it but hear tick, tick, boom

Life, it gets louder now
Can't stop it, won't slow down
Lost in this, all I can do
Is keep my eyes on you

I know the world turns around
I know the light's gonna go out
But until they do, I've got nothing to lose
I keep my eyes on you

I keep my eyes on the horizon
I keep my eyes on the horizon
I keep my eyes on the horizon (I...)
I keep my eyes on the horizon
I keep my eyes on the horizon
I keep my eyes on the horizon

I know the world turns around
I know the lights are gonna go out
But until they do, I've got nothing to lose
I've got nothing to lose
I keep my eyes on you
I keep my eyes on you, I
I keep my eyes on you
