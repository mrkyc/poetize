We met on a rainy evening in the summertime
Don't think I need to tell you more
I needed a raise
I worked so hard for this love of mine, love of mine
Still, I got nothing to show for it
Here's a simplification of everything we're going through
You plus me is bad news (Oh)
But you're a lovely creation
I like to think that I am too, ooh
But my friend said I look better without you, yeah, mm

And tongue tied and twisted
Go on, baby, and go to my head

Babe, baby, believe me
If I stay, it ain't gonna be easy
Okay, we'll do it your way
But this is the last time
You'll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down
Love on the rocks

You love the chase but hate me for the runaround
We both just tired of the whole thing (Tired of the whole thing)
Oh, when you tell me what you want you need you know you have to have
And I just pretend I'm listening (Listening)

Too tired this time (Ah)
To deal with old suits you wear, with your ties that won't bind

Babe, baby, believe me
If I stay, it ain't gonna be easy
Okay, we'll do it your way
But this is the last time
You'll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down

Hot as hell, cold as ice, sip it slow 'cause it's so nice
Dulls my senses, drives my pain, but I do it again
Burns a bit to the touch, dangerous if it's too much (Ah)
If this bottle could talk
Love on the rocks

Babe, baby, believe me
If I stay (Yeah)
Okay, we'll do it your way (Ooh, baby, baby, baby)
Believe me
You'll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down
