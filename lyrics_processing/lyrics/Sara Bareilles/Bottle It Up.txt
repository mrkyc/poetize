There'll be girls across the nation
That'll eat this up babe
I know that it's your soul but could you bottle it up and
Get down to the heart of it
No it's my heart you're shit out of your luck
Don't make me tell you again my love love love love
Love love love love
I am aiming to be somebody this somebody trusts
With her delicate soul
I don't claim to know much except soon as you start
To make room for the parts
That aren't you it gets harder to bloom in a garden of
Love love love love
Love Love love love

Only thing I ever could need, only one good thing
Worth trying to be and it's
Love, love, love, love
I do it for love
Love, love, love

We can understand the sentiment you're saying to us
Oh, but sensible sells could you kindly shut up
And get started
At keeping your part of the bargain
Aw please, little darlin'
You're killing me sweetly with love love love love
Love love love love

Only thing I ever could need, only one good thing
Worth trying to be and it's
Love, love, love, love
I do it for love
Love, love, love

Started as a flicker meant to be a flame
Skin has gotten thicker, but it burns the same
Still a baby in a cradle gotta take my first fall
Baby's getting next to nowhere with her back
Against the wall
You meant to make me happy make me sad
Wanna make it better, better so bad
But save your resolutions for your never new year
There is only one solution I can see here

Love you're all I ever could need
Only one good thing worth trying to be
And it's Love, love, love, love
I do it for love, love, love
Only gonna get get what you give away
