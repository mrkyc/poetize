Another carbon copy of where I've already been
Days keep coming
One out one in, they keep coming
I don't know what I wish I had
But there's no time now for thinking things like that
I've got too much to do
Too much to do
We've got too much to do
Too much to do
Opening up
Letting the day in
Pour you a cup
And say "Hello, how you been?"
Looking around
Seeing the same things
It's comforting how
Some things never change
Never change
Never change
Do they?
I wouldn't call this place a happy end
But I've been round the block and just came back again
Could be worse, so make it work, no place is perfect, hey

Because I feel too much and find it usually hurts
I like the way most of the days look exactly the same
Opening up
Every day starts
Over a cup served with
"Hello, how you been?"
Welcome it in
Whatever the day brings
More of the same things
Check the clock tick tick tock don't stop serve with a smile
Hurry up fill the coffee cup and then in a while
Take a breath when you need to be reminded that with
Days like these
We can only do the best we can
Then do it all again
It's the heartbeat
The center
The lifeline
You enter
It's the heartbeat (the heartbeat)
The center (the center)
The lifeline (the lifeline)
You enter (you enter)
It's the heartbeat (the heartbeat)
The center (the center)
The lifeline (the lifeline)
You enter (you enter)
Opening up
Letting the day in
Pour you a cup
And say "Hello, how you been?"
Looking around
Seeing the same things
It's comforting how
Some things never change
Never change
Never change
