Goodbye
Should be saying that to you by now, shouldn't I?
Laying down a law that I live by
Well, maybe next time

I've got a thick tongue
Brimming with the words that go unsung
I simmer, then I burn for a someone, the wrong one
And I tell myself to let the story end, oh
That my heart will rest in someone else's hand
But my 'why not me?' philosophy began
And I say

Ooh, how'm I gonna get over you?
I'll be alright, just not tonight
But someday
Oh, I wish you'd want me to stay
I'll be alright, just not tonight
But someday

Maybe it's a vicious little word that can slay me
Keep me where I'm hurting, you make me
Hang from your hands
But no more
I won't beg to buy a shot at your back door
If I'm aching at the thought of you, what for?
That's not me anymore
And I'm not the girl that I intend to be
But I dare you, darlin', just you wait and see
But this time, not for you, but just for me

Oh, I wish you'd want me to stay
I'll be alright, just not tonight
But someday

Say it's coming soon
Someday without you
All I can do is get me past the ghost of you
Wave goodbye to me
I won't say I'm sorry
I'll be alright
Once I find the other side of someday

Ohh, oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Ohh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh-oh (Whoa, oh-oh)
Whoa, oh-oh (Whoa, oh-oh)
Whoa, oh-oh
Oh-oh, ohh
Ooh, how'm I gonna get over you?
I'll be alright, just not tonight
But someday
Oh, I wish you'd want me to stay
I'll be alright, just not tonight
