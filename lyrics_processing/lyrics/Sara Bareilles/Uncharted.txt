Ahh, mmm

No words
My tears won't make any room for 'em
And it don't hurt like anything I've ever felt before
This is no broken heart
No familiar scars
This territory goes uncharted
Just me, in a room sunk down in a house in a town, and I
Don't breathe, though I never meant to let it get away from me
Now I have too much to hold
Everybody has to get their hands on gold
And I want uncharted

Stuck under the ceiling I made
I can't help the feeling

I'm going down
Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out, of foolproof ideas, so don't ask me how
To get started, it's all uncharted
La la la-a-a-a, oh

Each day
I'm counting up the minutes, 'til I get alone, 'cause I can't stay
In the middle of it all, it's nobody's fault, but I'm so low
Never knew how much I didn't know
Oh, everything is uncharted

I know I'm getting nowhere, when I only sit and stare like

I'm going down
Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out, of foolproof ideas, so don't ask me how
To get started, it's all uncharted

Jumpstart my kaleidoscope heart
I love to watch the colors fade
They may not make sense, but they sure as hell made me
I won't go as a passenger, no
Waiting for the road to be laid
Though I may be going down
I'll take in flame over burning out
Compare where you are to where you want to be
And you'll get nowhere
I'm going down
Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out, of foolproof ideas, so don't ask me how
To get started
Oh, I'm going down
Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out, of foolproof ideas, so don't ask me how
To get started, it's all uncharted
