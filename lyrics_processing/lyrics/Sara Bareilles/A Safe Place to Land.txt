When holding your breath is safer than breathing
When letting go is braver than keeping
When innocent words turn to lies
And you can't hide by closing your eyes

When pain is all that they offer
Like the kiss from the lips of a monster
You know the famine so well, but never met the feast
When home is the belly of the beast

The ocean is wild and over your head
And the boat beneath you is sinking
Don't need room for your bags, hope is all that you have
So say the Lord's Prayer twice, hold your babies tight
Surely someone will reach out a hand
And show you a safe place to land

Oh, imagine yourself in a building
Up in flames, being told to stand still
The window's wide open, this leap is on faith
You don't know who will catch you, but maybe somebody will

Be the hand of a hopeful stranger
Little scared, but you're strong enough
Be the light in the dark of this danger
'Til the sun comes up
Be the hand of a hopeful stranger
Little scared but you're strong enough
Be the light in the dark of this danger
'Til the sun comes up
Be the hand of a hopeful stranger
Little scared but you're strong enough
Be the light in the dark of this danger
'Til the sun comes up

'Til the sun comes up (Oh)
'Til the sun comes up ('Til the sun)
'Til the sun comes up (Ooh)
'Til the sun ('Til the sun)
