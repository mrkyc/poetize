You tell me that you're leavin'
You say that time will slow the bleedin'
Of this heart that I've placed into your hands
I held it out to you
Now you give it back, what am I supposed to do?
Oh, I had a feeling this day would come and leave me reeling
I just want to run back in your arms again
But they're no longer there
To hold me safe inside, to hold me anywhere

Ooh, if I can't have you
Then I'll have to find a way to get through
Though I don't want to
I have to do my best to recall
That I'm thankful that I held you at all

I miss you every morning and in the evening rain
Tonight, it's pouring, and I'm alone again
I count the seconds between the thoughts of you
I'm getting better, baby, I'm almost up to two
Oh, you had your reasons, and I know
Some folks are seasons, they got to come and go
But I'm still tender (Still tender), I miss the summertime
When I could feel your love and I could still feel mine

Ooh, if I can't have you
Then I'll have to find a way to get through
Though I don't want to
I have to do my best to recall
That I'm thankful that I held you

You gave me everything that I will need to walk this long road
(Show me the way to get back)
Gave me a sense of pride that I will carry with me
All the way back home

Ooh, if I can't have you
Then I'll have to find a way to get through
Though I don't want to
I have to do my best to recall
That I'm thankful that I held you at all

I'm thankful that I held you
(I'm thankful that I held you)
I'm thankful that I held you
I'm thankful that I held you, held you, held you
(I'm thankful that I held you)
I'm, I'm, I'm (Thankful that I held you)
