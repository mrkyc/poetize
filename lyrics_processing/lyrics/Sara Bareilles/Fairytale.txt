Cinderella's on her bedroom floor
She's got a crush on the guy at the liquor store
'Cause Mr. Charming don't come home anymore
And she forgets why she came here
Sleeping Beauty's in a foul mood, for shame
She says "None for you dear prince, I'm tired today
I'd rather sleep my whole life away than have you keep me from dreaming"

I don't care for your fairytales
You're so worried about the maiden
Though you know she's only waiting on the next best thing
Next best thing

Snow White is doing dishes again
'Cause what else can you do with seven itty-bitty men?
Sends them to bed and she calls up a friend
Says, "Would you meet me at midnight?"
Oh, the tall blonde lets out a cry of despair
Says, "Would cut it myself if I knew men could climb hair
I'll have to find another tower somewhere and keep away from the windows"

I don't care for your fairytales
You're so worried about the maiden
Though you know she's only waiting on the next best thing
Next best thing

Once upon a time in a far-away kingdom
Man made up a story, said that I should believe him
Go and tell your white knight that he's handsome in hindsight
But I don't want the next best thing
So I sing and hold my head down and I break these walls 'round me
Can't take no more of your fairytale love

I don't care for your fairytales
You're so worried about the maiden
Though you know she's only waiting on the next best thing

I don't care
I don't care
Worry 'bout the maiden
Though you know she's only waiting
Spent the whole life being graded on the sanctity of patience
And a dumb appreciation
But the story needs some mending and a better happy ending
'Cause I don't want the next best thing
