There's too many things that I haven't done yet
There's too many sunsets
I haven't seen
You can't waste the day wishing it'd slow down
You would've thought by now
I'd've learned something, yeah, yeah, yeah, mm
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

I made up my mind when I was a young girl
I've been given this one world
I won't worry it away
But now and again I lose sight of the good life
I get stuck in a low light
Then love comes in

How far do I have to go to get to you?
Many the miles
Many the miles, oh, whoa
How far do I have to go to get to you?
Many the miles, ooh
But send me the miles, and I'll be happy to
Follow you, love

I do what I can wherever I end up
To keep giving my good love
And spreading it around, yeah
'Cause I've had my fair share of take care and goodbyes
I've learned how to cry
And I'm better for that, sing

How far do I have to go to get to you?
Many the miles
Many the miles, oh, whoa
How far do I have to go to get to you?
Many the miles, ooh
Send me the miles, and I'll be happy to, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Red letter day
I'm in a blue mood
Wishing that blue would just carry me away
I've been talking to God, don't know if it's helping or not
But surely something has got to, got to, got to give
'Cause I can't keep waiting to live
How far do I have to go to get to you?
Many the miles
Many the miles, oh, whoa
How far do I have to go to get to you?
Many the miles, ooh
But send me the miles, and I'll be happy to, yeah
How far do I have to go to get to you?
Many the miles
Many the miles, oh, yeah, yeah
How far do I have to go to get to you? (Have to go)
Many the miles
Many the miles
Been talking to God, don't know if it's helping or not
How far do I have to go to get to you?
Many the miles
Many the miles, oh, oh
How far do I have to go to get to you?
Many the miles, ooh
Oh, send me the miles, and I'll be happy to
Follow you, love
