I stick with real things
Usually facts and figures
When information's in its place I minimize the guessing game
Guess what?
I don't like guessing games or when I feel things
Before I know the feelings
How am I supposed to operate if I'm just tossed around by fate?
Like on an unexpected date

With a stranger who might talk too fast
Or ask me questions about myself before I've decided that
He can ask me questions about myself
He might sit too close
Or call the waiter by his first name
Or eat Oreos
But eat the cookie before the cream
But what scares me the most...
What scares me the most...

Is what if when he sees me
What if he doesn't like it?
What if he runs the other way and I can't hide from it
What happens then if
When he knows me
He's only disappointed?
What if I give myself away to only get it given back?
I couldn't live with that
So I'm just fine inside my shell-shaped mind
This way I get the best view
So when he sees me, I want him to

I'm not defensive
I'm simply being cautious
I can't risk reckless dating
Due to my miscalculating why
A certain suitor stands in line I've seen in movies
Most made for television
You cannot be too careful when it comes to sharing your life
I could end up a miserable wife

He could be criminal
Some sort of psychopath who escaped from an institution somewhere where they don't have girls
He could have masterminded some way to find me
He could be color blind
How untrustworthy is that? He could be less than kind
Or even worse, he could be very nice, have lovely eyes
And make me laugh
Come out of hiding
What do I do with that?
Oh god

What if when he sees me
I like him and he knows it
What if he opens up a door and I can't close it?
What happens then?
If when he holds me
My heart is set in motion
I'm not prepared for that I'm scared of breaking open
But still I can't help from hoping
To find someone to talk to
Who likes the way I am
