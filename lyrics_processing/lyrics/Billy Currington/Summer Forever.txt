Ain't ready for the leaves to change, don't wanna get off this swing
No, I ain't jealous when the sun's kissing on you
Maybe it's that southern wind, maybe it's your perfect skin
That's killing me through the holes in your silver blues
Baby, what's up? This is more than a crush
Already dressed like that, heat rises, it's a fact
Baby, three months just ain't long enough
We can turn the clock back, flip over the hour glass

Summer forever
Ain't nothin' better than love makin' weather
Summer forever
Hotter than winter on that Silverado leather
Days are getting longer, kisses getting stronger
It's the kinda song that makes you wanna sing along
Summer forever
Ooh-ooh

I'm talking fireworks, I'm talking on fire
Barefoot walking, chasing whiskey with a flat tire

It don't matter where we go
And let's ride an open road
And a sunroof open
Make it up and say we rode it like

That's right
You and me, the sunshine
The water, it's summertime
