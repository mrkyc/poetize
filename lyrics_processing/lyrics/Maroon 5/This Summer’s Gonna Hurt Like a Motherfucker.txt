This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something

I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
See Maroon 5 LiveGet tickets as low as $69You might also like
She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it

I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker

Has to have it all, chases every star, she's so popular (Whoo!)
Has to have it all, chases every star, she's so popular, oh
This summer's gonna hurt, it's gonna hurt
I see her dancing in the street
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
'Cause she's so fancy
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker, fucker
