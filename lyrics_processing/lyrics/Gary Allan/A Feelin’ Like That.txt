Felt the wind hit my face
Before my shoot opened I felt my heart race
I was fallin
Oh that's just fallin
Off the coast of australia
I dove way down deep
For all that I saw of that Great Barrier Reef
It was nothin
Compared to you it was nothin
I got lightning in my vains
Thunder in my chest
All tangled up with you and tryin to catch my breath
I've been chasing that sensation half way
Around the world and lookin' back
On what we had
I've done it all I've seen it all but
I can't find a feelin' like that
I wound up in some town in spain
Runnin with the bulls
Tryin to catch another thrill with a thousand other fools
We were runnin
Ah but thats just runnin
When I started pushin 30
It started pushin back

Nothin seems to follow
I got lightning in my vains
Thunder in my chest
All tangled up with you and tryin to catch my breath
I've been chasing that sinsation half way
Around the world and lookin' back
On what we had
I've done it all I've seen it all but
I can't find a feelin' like that
It's like flyin down some back road at midnight
With you eyes closed and the head lights off
Your life is searchin everywhere can't find that feelin anywhere
Your all I want, now all I want is that...
Lightning in my vains
Thunder in my chest
All tangled up with you and tryin to catch my breath
I've been chasing that sensation half way
Around the world and looin back
On what we have
I've done it all i've seen it all but I can't find a feelin' like that
Thats right I've done it all
