I heard a voice and it changed my life
Now it's a brand new day
And I ain't afraid to say
You're not alone when you're down and out
And I think you know who I'm talking about
When I don't know how I'll get through
I ask myself what would Willie do
What would Willie do, well he'd travel so far
With nothing but a song and his old guitar
And a tour bus and some semi-trucks
Thirty crew men and a little bit of luck
Well, he loves all the people, the ugly and the randy
If you don't believe me, take a look at the family
And they'll tell you that it's true
When skies are gray, what would Willie do?
Well, long ago he came unto us
His words were simple but they went right through us
And the whole world sang along
Then they didn't want to hear his songs
He was gone and we thought we'd lost him
But he grew his hair and he moved to Austin
And all of the people smiled
They came to hear him sing from miles

From New York City down to Mississippi
Stood together and raised a brew
Where it's all gone wrong, what would Willie do?
You know sometimes I wonder, when I ain't getting nowhere
What would old Willie do when it all gets too much to bear?
And I can see him on his lonely old tour bus
He's got his problems just like any of us
Well, he'd just take a deep breath and then he'd let it all go
And he'd take another deep breath and let it all go
And he'd take another deep breath
And he'd hold it
Ah and I bet he'd feel hungry in a way that seems strange
Yeah, hungry for all the things that he just can't change
Like the time he passed out in is own bedroom and his wife sewed him up in the sheets
And beat him with a broom and he forgave her
And you think that's rough, then the IRS came
And they took away all of his stuff
They took his golf course and his recording studio
Well, he just went out and did another show
So when it's all coming down on you
Better ask yourself, what would Willie do?
What would Willie do, well he'd take a little time
And talk to old rooster as he'd drive on down the line
And there's millions down that road
And with a word he's gonna lighten their load
He loves all the people, no matter their races
Hell, he even had a hit country song with Julio Iglesias
And that ain't easy to do
So when it's all too much, what would Willie...
When the game gets tough, what would Willie...
