Well, this town has closed down way too early and there's nothing to do
So I'm driving around in circles and I'm thinking about you
Today I heard you got a new last name
Sure didn't know it was gonna hit me this way
And the radio just keeps on playin' all these songs about rain

"Rainy Night In Georgia", "Kentucky Rain"

Now there's all kinds of songs about babies and love that goes right
But for some unknown, reason nobody wants to play them tonight
Hey, I hope its sunny wherever you are
But that's sure not the picture tonight in my car
And it sure ain't easing my pain all these songs like

"Rainy Night In Georgia" and "Kentucky Rain"
"Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again"
Blue eyes crying in the early morning rain
They go on and on, and there's no two the same
Oh, it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain

Well, I thought I was over you, but I guess maybe I'm not
'Cause when I let you go, looks like lonely is all that I got
Guess I'll never know what could have been
Sure ain't helping this mood that I'm in
If they're gonna keep on playin' these songs like
