The one who never gave you what you need
It's true I wasn't always around
Back when you were reaching out for me
I know you think I didn't care
You say I'm just the hurtin' kind
I know you think my heart wasn't there
But I'm begging you to think it through one more time
'Cause you don't know a thing about me
If you don't know how much I miss you
And you don't know a thing about me
Unless you know how much I need to be with you
Well I see the mistakes I made
The way I acted carelessly
But if you don't know how much I need your forgiveness
Then you don't know a thing about me
If I could just go back and make it right
And take the tears away, you know I would
I'd come to you with no excuse tonight
Just a prayer that I'll be understood
You tell me that I'm never gonna change
How I'll always be the same old guy
You think there's nothing left for us to say
Before you write me off, take a look in my eyes
