It'll take you to a bar
It'll take you to the moon
When you're two months late, it'll take you to a church too slow
Seventeen says go
But the bible says wait
In the back of a chevy, it'll tell you you're ready when you ain't

It turns love into drama
It turns girls into mamas
Yeah, that first-time won't ever let you forget
Wouldn't be here without it
We don't like to talk about it
Sometimes we spell it out
It's just an S, just an E, just an X

Call it up in the middle of the night
Sometimes it's wrong, sometimes it's right
Even at its worst, it's still the best

Goes good with a record
Goes good with the rain
If you can't get it you can't get it off your brain
It'll break your heart, and starts some gossip
And in a one-horse too small town it'll keep you in the closet

It turns love into drama
It turns girls into mamas
Yeah that first-time won't ever let you forget
Wouldn't be here without it
We don't like to talk about it
It's just an S, just an E, just an X

Call it up in the middle of the night
Sometimes it's wrong, sometimes it's right
Even at its worst, it's still the best

Get you drunker than the whiskey
It ain't always 50/50
'Cause they ain't made nothing quite like it yet
Yeah, sometimes it's in a hurry
Some people think it's dirty
But it comes off kinda flirty in a text

Yeah, X's and O's, and birds and bees
I don't know much, but if you ask me
Even at its worst, it's still the best
It's still the best
It'll take you to a bar
