I for I, we cross this divide
One for one, into our demise
It's a parasitic trend, looking for a victim
Stuck inside a hivemind fantasy
But the static in your head is a feature of the system
Just another digital lobotomy

And when it all blows up, the sun will still be shining
And when it all falls down, you think you'll still pretend?
I got a feeling, in the end, you might be lying
So tell me, are you happy now?
Living in the upside-down
Giving it a whirl
It's a brave new fucking world

Oh

(Nihilistic) Rage
You think you're enemies, but you're all the same
So maybe it's just you
And the monsters tried, and they got inside
But they weren't under your bed
They're in your brains
Manipulating you

And when it all falls down, you think you'll still pretend?
I got a feeling, in the end, you might be lying
So tell me, are you happy now?
Living in the upside-down
Giving it a whirl
It's a brave new fucking world

The bigger the lie, the further it goes
It's all fun and games 'til the overthrow
When it gets inside and it starts to grow
Then say goodbye 'cause that's the death blow
But I'm not giving up that easy
I'm not giving up my mind
'Cause the more that you try, the more that they need
There's nowhere to hide when they break out the guillotine

Break out the guillotine
When they break out the guillotine
Guillotine

And when it all blows up, the sun will still be shining
And when it all falls down, you think you'll still pretend?
I got a feeling, in the end, you might be lying
So tell me, are you happy now?
Living in the upside-down
Giving it a whirl
