Stardust
In you and in me
Fuse us into unity
Primeval we're coupled
Born from the universe
Farewell the void is calling
Don't fear for futures and dreams
They're fleeting, retreating
It's okay, I promise

I don't know what to say
But I'm going to want you till the stars evaporate
We're only here for just a moment in the light
One day it shines for us the next we're in the night
So say the word and I'll be running back to find you
A thousand armies won't stop me I'll break through
I'll soar the endless skies for only one sight
Of your starlight

Tell me just tell me to stay
I'll turn I won't look away
I'll stay here
I'll never go but you don't feel the same
Farewell farewell and godspeed
Light years between you and me
I'm fading your beauty conquers the darkness

At night the earth will rise
And I'll think of you each time I watch from distant skies
Whenever stars go down and galaxies ignite
I'll think of you each time they wash me in their light
And fall in love with you again
I will find you
A thousand armies won't stop me I'll break through
I'll soar the endless skies for only one sight of your starlight

Don't leave me lost here forever
Show me your starlight and pull me through
Don't leave me lost here forever (Lost here forever)
I need your starlight and pull me through
(Bring me back to you)
Bring me back to you

At night the earth will rise
And I'll think of you each time I watch from distant skies
Whenever stars go down and galaxies ignite
I'll think of you each time they wash me in their light
And fall in love with you again
I will find you
A thousand armies won't stop me I'll break through
