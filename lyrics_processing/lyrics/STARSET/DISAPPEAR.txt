So how long were you numb?
'Cause it was cold as ice
And I keep saying that I'm okay with it
But that's another lie
The truth is I've been dying slowly
But no, not you, you just
Turned to drift into the night
A parting scene of apathy
In an instant shift to a
Stone heart, paired with empty eyes
That stared right through mine

I did the math but it just don't add up
There's a whole world that used to be us
Now there's an echo calling me
Just a shred of memory
Emptiness but there's still a shadow
I catch a glimpse of someone I should know
Hard to tell if you were ever here
I disappear, disappear
I disappear, disappear

All is lost, slipped away
Gone without a trace
I sometimes wonder if it was real because
All that's left seems fake
Like I'm trapped within a wrong dimension
I tried so hard just to
Make you feel my pain
If you had empathy, you'd see I'd changed
But like a ghost in your presence, I dissipate
I tried it all, it's all in vain

There's a whole world that used to be us
Now there's an echo calling me
Just a shred of memory
Emptiness but there's still a shadow
I catch a glimpse of someone I should know
Hard to tell if you were ever here
I disappear, disappear
I disappear, disappear

Sometimes, I still slip
And start to question if
It was only in my mind
It's hard to come to grips
That you still exist
When it feels just like you died
So come one and all
Step right up and I'll
Perform a trick before your eyes
I'll evaporate
Gone without a trace
Off the radar, out of sight

I did the math but it just don't add up
There's a whole world that used to be us
Now there's an echo calling me
Just a shred of memory
Emptiness but there's still a shadow
I catch a glimpse of someone I should know
Hard to tell if you were ever here
I disappear, disappear
I disappear, disappear
