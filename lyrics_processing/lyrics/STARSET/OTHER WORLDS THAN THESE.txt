Ten feet tall behind your wall
Telling yourself that you're not small
Roll yourself into a tight ball
You can't be lost, if you've gone AWOL

You've never had one question
So comfortable living life so certain
Let me tell you about this then
No one really knows the truth
No, not you

There are monsters in the sky
There are demons in the sea
I have seen them with my eyes
I've seen what you won't see
Pull the wool out from your eyes
It won't shade your frail belief
In the end we cannot hide
There are other worlds than these

Closed up minds, are hearty seeds
So plant yourself a gallows tree
Bury your head so you won't see
The truth you hide is the truth you seek

There are demons in the sea
I have seen them with my eyes
I've seen what you won't see
Pull the wool out from your eyes
It won't shade your frail belief
In the end we cannot hide
There are other worlds than these

Are we flakes of empty dust
Spinning on a ball of rust?
Maybe
But the light is ours to see
You had eyes, but sewed them shut
But that feeling in your gut won't fade
Is it all a tragedy?
Are we flashes in a rut
Going in and out of luck?
Maybe
But the answers will not change
Even when they're covered up
All these questions in your gut won't fade
There are monsters in the sky
There are demons in the sea
I have seen them with my eyes
I've seen what you won't see
Pull the wool out from your eyes
It won't shade your frail belief
In the end we cannot hide
There are other worlds than
