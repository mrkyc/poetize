We've been burying the pages
We've been trying to erase this
Built a wall between the truth and us
And it's not enough
We've burned through all the witches
From the paupers to the righteous
In a bubble that will never bust
And it's not enough

Left blind in the darkness
But that's fine 'cause you like it
Sheep becoming wolves and you eat from the paw
So open up and say, "Ah"

Let's all spoon-feed on our own delusions
All I see is a fake revolution
The same old things with the same solutions
It's anarchy, it's de-evolution
It's de-evolution

There's no wood for the bridges
When the land is too divided
We've been fighting off the undertow
Now we fall below

So open up and take
Your medicine and say "Ah"

Let's all spoon-feed on our own delusions
All I see is a fake revolution
The same old things with the same solutions
It's anarchy, it's de-evolution (De-evolution)

One general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, is multiply
Therein, let the strongest live, and the weakest die
Eventually, a species can become complacent
At that point, a de-evolution can occur
A spiral downwards, signaling an end for that lifeform

You still eat straight from the paw
You still eat straight from the paw
Convoluted lies
It's the end that you prophesize
And it's all pretend
From a bargain Darwin
And you're inside the plan
While the lord of flies
Is opening its maw
And the wolves take out their claws
You still eat straight from the paw
You still eat straight from the paw
You still eat straight from the paw
So open up, open up, open up and say "Ah"
Let's all spoon-feed on our own delusions
All I see is a fake revolution
The same old things with the same solutions
It's anarchy, it's de-evolution
