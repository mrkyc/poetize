About love!

I don't wanna be without you girl (got me slowly dying)
Where did we go wrong my girl (why can't we keep on trying)
I don't wanna be without you girl (I gave my heart to you)
Going outta my mind, 'cause I love you, I need you girl
Baby baby baby, you know we go back for oh so long
Baby baby baby, used to having you here in my arms
Baby baby baby, you know what we had was oh so strong
Just say you'll still be mine, 'cause I love you, I need you girl
 My homey, lover, friend, together yeah, we had it all
Could never see an end, just left forever, deep in love
We'd get our groove on
Do everything so happily, so free
And nothing anyone could ever hate on (yeah, yeah, yeah)
 Baby you're my everything, I'll do anything for ya
Never knew another girly quite like ya
And I wanna excite ya
Like, like giving you what you wanna do girl
If there's anyone, I'll straight run 'em
Unfadeable, gd stun 'em

Never did you answer once, you know that's wrong (you know that's really wrong, yeah)
Can we talk this out, I wanna know why did you leave me hanging, oh so damn right
Don't you see me praying, don't leave me alone (about love)
 Yo, we used to be one, lovers on the run, no doubt
Fo' sho, we got each other's back, that's fact yo
Never had a big prob, we'd solve and evolve like a couple should is all, that's all
It seemed we had the love thing on lock
With everything we were top
But little did I know
That you would just up and go

True colors baby, now I know (you know)
