She stands there looking at me, I know she's wonderin'
If she should kick it with me 'cause you all got that somethin'
If she be wanting to freak the shakin' thunderin'
And now she's starting to creep up on me

Man, she looks so good (Man, she looks so good)
And she looks so fine (Looks so fine)
Steady takes me high
Singing 'My Oh My' (Oh my, my, my, my)
Got to get with her (Gotta get with her)
Have her in my world (In my world)
Hold her in my arms
That's forever, yo

I wanna rock with you, dance with you
Do everything with you
Run around in the rain with you
Everyday now only you
Rock with you, dance with you
Do everything with you
Run around in the rain with you
Everyday now only you
