We once were luminous lovers, just you and I
We shone as brightly as the stars in the summer sky
My light was only s'posed to shine on another guy
So lover, hang on

I've grown accustomed to the role of the crying one
You brought me to another world where the crying's done
And now the other man's cryin' has just begun
So lover, hang on

Hang on, hang on
Until then I whisper to my lover
Tell him I'll be back again another day
Hang on, hang on
Until then I whisper to my lover
Tell him I'll be back again another day

Our night of luminous love was just a start
We're a brand new binary star, put us on the charts
Lover, hang on, first I've gotta go and break a heart
So lover, hang on

Hate goodbye
Gotta go, baby
Hey that's life
Know that I hate it
Hate goodbyes
Hate long waiting
Ain't no fire like the one that I'm saving
Our night of luminous love was just a start
(Summer's gone, winter's waiting)
We're a brand new binary star, put us on the charts
(Want you to know I hurt back, baby)
Lover, hang on, first I've gotta go and break a heart
(Ain't no fire like the one that I'm saving)
Ain't no fire like the one that I'm savin' for good, baby

Hang on, hang on
Until then I whisper to my lover
Tell him I'll be back again another day
Hang on, hang on
Until then I whisper to my lover
Tell him I'll be back again another day
Hang on, hang on
Until then I whisper to my lover
Tell him I'll be back again another day
Hang on, hang on
Until then I whisper to my lover
