Everybody's tryin' to track us down
Drivin' circles 'round this tiny town
And I get lost, baby
Tryin' to shake 'em off
And I get tired
Wrestlin' with my jealous mind

I don't care if it's a sunny day
No construction in the passin' lane
Every light I can see is goin' green to blue
(What a thing to do)
Anytime anybody looks at you
(Won't you put the brakes on my heartache?)

When you're on the go
You gotta let me know that you love me
Show me you love me somehow
You gotta let me know that you love me
Show me you love me now

When you gimme those red light kisses
Baby, it's a sure sign you love your mister or missus
Gimme those red light kisses
When you gimme those red light, red light

Well, you know I love you 'cause it's what I said
But you know I've got a foot of lead
And I move along
Well, I'm not afraid to play the field
When I'm on the road, no, I don't stop and I don't yield
(Why do you do this to me, baby?)

When you're on the go
You gotta let me know that you love me
Show me you love me somehow
You gotta let me know that you love me
Show me you love me
Oh, show me you love me

(Lemme know you love me)
(Lemme know you love me, baby)
(Lemme know, lemme know, lemme know)
(Lemme know you love me)
(Lemme know you love me, baby)
(Lemme know you love me)

Yeah, everybody's tryin' to track us down
Chasin' their tails 'round and 'round
But they're out of luck, baby
We are skippin' town
And I could cry
Baby lean into my side
When we're ridin' together and we get delayed
I don't mind, baby, just rewind the tape
We'll play it all over if we get delayed
Just a couple of feet goes a long, long way

When you gimme those red light kisses
Baby, it's a sure sign you love your mister or missus
Gimme those red light kisses
Baby, it's a sure sign you love your mister or missus
Gimme those red light kisses
Baby, it's a sure sign you love your mister or missus
Gimme those red light kisses
Baby, it's a sure sign you love your mister or missus
Gimme those red light kisses
