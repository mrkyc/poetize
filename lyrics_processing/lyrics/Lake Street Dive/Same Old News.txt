I just want to love you, I just want to try
I know we're the subject of a thousand prying eyes
I worry about the gossip, do you think that we'll be fine?
There ain't no way to stop it, so I won't change my mind

I would run away with you any day
If we could
But I don't think that running anywhere
Would do us any good

We just keep on making
The same old news
People talk about us, but what would they do without us?
It's the same old news
I just want to love you
But it's causing so much trouble
I guess it's the same old, same old news

I just want to love you in some old-fashion way
Instead, we're picked apart for everything we say

I would change my name for you
(What would you change it?)
To anything, for what it's worth
Mmm, oh, but I know that they'd find us anyway
At the corners of the earth

We just keep on making
The same old news
I'm feeling overtired from being so hardwired
It's the same old news
Causing such a fuss that they want to lock us up

Well, ain't it a shame the way they exclaim?
Like being in love is something they want us to explain
But I guess it's the same old
Same old news

Oh, let's move onto an island a million miles from shore
At least until they build a tower (Mmm)
Where there wasn't one before

We just keep on making
The same old news
People talk about us, but what would they do without us?
It's the same old news
I just want to love you
But it's causing so much trouble
It's the same old, same old news
Every time we kiss
I can hear them start to whisper
They know all our secrets (Yes, they do)
And they know where we've been (Oh)
Well, they're inside our head
And underneath our skin, yeah
Oh, haven't you heard? (Oh)
It's so absurd (Oh)
Well, I think it's a waste
But it's still a basic human urge
To keep spreading the same old, same old
Same old, same old
