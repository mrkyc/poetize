You don't need a team of lawyers looking for evidence
You don't need a piece of paper trying to prove your intent
To be free
You don't need to look back, easy, if you said what you meant
You don't need your heart running at a hundred percent
All you need

I don't need a deposition to believe what you said
I don't need a crystal ball to hear the thoughts in your head
I can see
I don't need a judge and jury to determine our fate
I don't need a priest to tell me that you ain't been a saint
All we need is me

I'm tired of hearing 'bout your flaws
And all the broken laws
And the hearts you've left behind
It's not up to you to make up my mind

So free yourself up to love me
Just love me like a good man
Free yourself up to love me
If you can
So free yourself up to love me
Just love me like a good man
Free yourself up to love me
If you can

You don't need to call a doctor, show me where you've been cut
You don't need to call a locksmith, I can tell the door's shut
Where's the key?
I don't need to see a lineup, I know who's been involved
Don't you turn yourself in, you know the crime has been solved
You are free, you are free

I'm tired of hearing 'bout your flaws
And all the broken laws
And the hearts you've left behind
Well, it's not up to you to make up my mind
And if in hindsight it's a mistake, at least we tried

Free yourself up to love me
Just love me like a good man
Free yourself up to love me
If you can
Free yourself up to love me
Just love me like a good man
Free yourself up to love me
If you can
Free yourself up to love me
Just love me like a good man
Free yourself up to love me
If you can
Free yourself up to love me
Just love me like a good man
Free yourself up to love me
If you can
Free yourself up
Love me like a good man
Free yourself up
Well love me, well love me like a good man
If you can
