Yeah, we're like baseball and hot dogs
You're Ferris Bueller and I'm your day off
The E-Street Band and the Boss
You know you're my happy clouds and I'm Bob Ross

So let me tell ya, boy
In no uncertain terms
I finally found the words

Don't ya know that I know that you know that I know
That you want me?
And don't I know that you know that I know that you know
That I want you?
So let it be known, by letter or phone
All our other lovers better leave us alone
Get ready to go, 'cause I'm taking you home

Yeah, we like sneakers and gym socks
You're happy hour and I am five o'clock
You're Captain Kirk to my Spock
You know I'm Dee Dee Ramone and you're punk rock
See Lake Street Dive LiveGet tickets as low as $19You might also like
So let me tell you, boy
Don't leave it up to fate
It's time to set things straight

Don't ya know that I know that you know that I know
That you want me?
And don't I know that you know that I know that you know
That I want you?
So let it be known, by letter or phone
All our other lovers better leave us alone
Get ready to go, 'cause I'm taking you home

And when we get home, throw your coat on my bed
But that's the only thing we'll do in here for now
Turn the lights down low and the music up loud
You know, you dance so good, won't you show me how?
It's like we've been together much longer than is true
We've watched the forming of the sun
And we'll be there to colonize the moon
If it's not too soon

Don't ya know that I know that you know that I know
That you want me?
And don't I know that you know that I know that you know
That I want you?
So let it be known, by letter or phone
All our other lovers better leave us alone
Get ready to go, 'cause I'm taking you home
And don't ya know that I know that you know that I know
That you want me?
And don't I know that you know that I know that you know
That I want you?
So let it be known, by letter or phone
All our other lovers better leave us alone
Get ready to go, 'cause I'm taking you home
