You don't need your back against the wall
Let me figure out how to surrender
All I wanna do is take the fall
I can tell you things that don't come easy
Words I never tried to say before
I see it in your eyes, I know you hear me
Baby, I can't take it anymore

(Easy on you, baby)
I wanna make it easy on you, baby
I can try pushing you aside
Well, force myself to have a change of heart
Well, none will fill the space that you have left behind, no
Why don't we just finish what we start?
Oh, I can be alone almost anytime
I'm really tempted today
Boy, you got me thinking what's the crime, yeah
I can get used to me this way
