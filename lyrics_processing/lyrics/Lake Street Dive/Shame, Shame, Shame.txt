Little hands hold the gavel
Another one's about to fall down
Get upset and unravel
Another one's about to fall down

Shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, shame on you

Every place that you travel
Another one's about to fall down
Little face in the gravel
Another one's about to fall down

Pain, pain, pain
Shame, shame, shame on you
I bet you think you're a big man now
But you don't know how to be a good man too

No, I'm not getting caught in your little spiderweb
Won't let an angry dog get me down
Don't you think it's time we put this dog out of his misery?

Hold your breath underwater
'Cause another one's about to fall down
Lead the lamb to the slaughter
Another one's about to fall down

Shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, shame on you
It's not a game, game, game
Shame, shame, shame, shame on you
I bet you think that you're a big man now
But I think you're a sick man now
And you don't know how to be a good man too

No, I'm not getting caught in your little spiderweb
Won't let an angry dog get me down
Don't you think it's time that we put this dog out of his misery?
