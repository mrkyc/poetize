Hard times, hard times
When I really need somebody to hold me tight
And tell me that I'm strong
Last night, last night
You were really there for me, so thank you
For playin' along

But I gotta be honest with ya, baby
This is not about love
I gotta be honest with ya, baby
I'm not above usin' you to get me through the night

Baby, don't leave me alone with my thoughts
I don't wanna get caught in the current of my mind
Baby, don't leave me alone with my thoughts

An old man, an old man
Has got his little hands on the button
Feels like nothin' anyone can do
People out there crackin' up, crackin' up
And I'm just tryin' to keep it together
Notice that I feel better when I'm holdin' you

But I gotta be honest with ya, baby
This is not about love
I gotta be honest with ya, baby
You're here help rid me of
The demons of the night

Baby, don't leave me alone with my thoughts
I don't wanna get caught in the current of my mind
Baby, don't leave me alone with my thoughts

Would you be my human shield?
Hold you so that I don't feel anything?
Hold you so that I don't feel the ringin' in my head?

Baby, don't leave me alone with my thoughts
I don't wanna get caught in the current of my mind
Baby, don't leave me alone with my thoughts
I don't wanna get caught in the prison of the present time
Baby, don't leave me alone with my thoughts

Would you be my human shield?
Hold you up so that I don't feel anything?
Would you be my human shield?
Hold you so that I don't feel anything?
