When they told me where the fool had gone
Oh I was but the youngest one
Up there on the hills they're climbing on
You went up with an open heart
When they found you it was all but cold
Those hounds, they sing so low
Up there on the hills, they're climbing on
You saw the light of gold and rushed
You said you couldn't fight it off
This is the story of the one you lost
And I want it to run over your love
You found it in the deepest thorns
Flooded up from the darkest wells
Ring your heartstrings with the bells
Up there on the hills they're climbing on
And if I hadn't drowned up there
Then the night before the storm took hold
I know I would find them gold
Up there on the hills they find me on
Another sight of gold, you rushed
"Oh I could never fight them off."
Another story of the one you lost
And I want it to run over your love

In your eyes, the find you fading
Twenty-one roses you hold, but they're fading now -
In your eyes, I'm still there waiting
How could I be the last to know
When they told me where the fool had gone?
Oh I was but the youngest one
Up there on the hills they'll find me on
Another sight of gold, you rushed
"Oh I could never fight them off."
Another story of the one you lost
And I want it to run over
I wanted to take over
