I know I can't go home again
I'm in trouble, I'd be living in
A future I can never know
And a past that is holding on
Holding on to me broken
Holding on to me still
I thought I could break the spell
And maybe I, maybe I never will

I know a ghost coming round again
(In the name of)
Battlefield I'm abandoning
(In the name of)
A promise of a day like this
(In the name of)
Or a memory and a kiss
(In the name of)
Can't see all the walls I built
(In the name of)
Turn my fear into monuments
(In the name of)
Daydream I've been living in
(In the name of)
You might also like
But when I wake up here I'll be
Holding on till it's broken
Holding on and on till the end
I thought I would break the spell
Oh, maybe I, maybe I never will

If it feels like
Living in the name of
Feels like
Living in the name of
Oh, I can't keep
Living in the name of
If it feels like
Living in the name of
Why am I living in the name of?
Why am I living in the name of?

I know I can't go home again
I'm in trouble, I'd be living in
Old dreams and they're caving in
Now I'm somewhere I never been
Just keep holding on till I'm broken
Holding on till the end
I thought I had found a friend
And maybe I, maybe I never will

If it feels like
Living in the name of?
Does it feel like
Living in the name of?
And you can't keep
Living in the name of
Oh, I can't keep
Living in the name of
Why am I living in the name?
(Living in the name of)
Oh, am I living in the name?
(Living in the name of)
Why am I living in the name of?
(Living in the name of)
Am I living, if it feels like
Living in the name
If it feels like
(If it feels like)
Living in the name
Does it feel like
(Feel like)
Living in the name
When you can't keep
(Can't keep)
Living in the name of
When you can't keep
Oh, can't keep
Why am living in the name of?
