Long hair and longer stride
Skateboard affair with a primal tribe
In your cut-off painter pants
Charging down the craggy mountains with our thrift store friends
And who you find so
So in love with the fallen earth
Oh, you wake in the middle of the falling night
With the summer playing coy
And in the attics of the city night
We talked Corso and the MC5
And you could dance like
We were all alright

And only the wild ones
Give you something and never want it back
Oh, the riot and the rush of the warm night air
Only the wild ones
Are the ones you can never catch
Stars are up now, no place to go but everywhere
One I met in the Green Mountain State
I dropped out; he moved away
Heard he got some land down south
Changed his name to a name the birds could pronounce

And only the wild ones
Give you something and never want it back
Oh, the riot and the rush of the warm night air
Only the wild ones
Are the ones you can never catch
Stars are up now, no place to go but everywhere
(No place to go but everywhere)
And in the city the mayor said
Those who dance are all misled
So you packed your things and moved to the other coast
Said you gonna be like Charlie Rose
And only the wild ones
Give you something and never want it back
Oh, the riot and rush of the warm night air
Only the wild ones
Are the ones you can never catch
Stars are up now, no place to go but everywhere
Only the wild ones
Give you something and never want it back
Oh, the riot and rush of the warm night air
Only the wild ones
Are the ones you can never catch
