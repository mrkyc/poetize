You raise your head, beneath the sun
But your boys they lie so close to you
Do you dare get up and wake the two
Oh Elias, as I see you there, at work in the daytime
Do you think you could answer all the questions in the world
In just one word - I think you could
If you die will I get word that you're gone
Will I hear it in passing conversation
Will I stop short and fall to the ground
Distance is short when your hand carries what your eye found

Honest and Manuel, well you know, they're at school now
Given the chance that their father's never seen
To see whats beyond Section 17
And in ten years, when you look back at your boys
Well you know they've grown way taller
Than the tallest sugar cane in the field
If you die will I get word that you're gone?
Will I hear it in passing conversation?
Will I stop short and fall to the ground?
Distance is short when your hand carries what your eye found
Hold my hand just one more time
To see if you're really gonna meet me
Hold my hand just one more time
Hold my hand just one more time
Hold my hand just one more time
To see if you're really gonna meet me
I see your wife. She stands stooped over by the fire outside
And I see your boys. And when they look up
You know I think they got their mother's eyes
Cause she looks so proud. She looks so happy
She looks so proud. She looks so happy. Yeaaaaaaaaah
If you die will I get word that you're gone?
Will I hear it in passing conversation?
Will I stop short and fall to the ground?

Hold my hand just one more time
To see if you're really gonna meet me
Hold my hand just one more time
To see if you're really gonna meet me
Hold my hand just one more time. (Aya, Aya, Ayaahah)
Hold my hand, one more time. (Aya, Aya, Ayaahah)

Hold my hand just one more time
To see if you're really gonna meet me
Hold my hand just one more time
