Think I'll begin my story there
And if the Prime Minister says he's had enough
I'll go back to St. Johnsbury to breathe the air
Thats where I met a girl called Josaphine
They call her Josaphine the Fair
She had Manch Vegas written across her back
She just cut off all her hair
We shared a blanket by the tracks in Lebanon, New Hampshire
I could not sleep a better dream
But I never felt so awake and alive
'til I noticed my jacket was gone and so was Josaphine

Josaphine, Josaphine, Josaphine
How come you ain't no where to be seen?
Josaphine, Josaphine, Josaphine
How come, how come, Josaphine?
Soon after she must have had a change of heart
Cause as the train caught up speed
Like seeing the moon in the middle of the day
I felt like my feet were just gonna float away
When I heard her yelling "Chicoree"
She was taking off her jacket as she ran
I said forget the jacket just give me your hand
I'm getting off at the first stop up in Canada
I can make you happy there
She said it would be a while
I said I'll wait
She said it could be a while
I said I'll wait
Keep the jacket just bring it to me someday

She had caught in the crowd
With the rain so loud
That you couldn't hear your up and down
Heart beat now
Did you come back to New Hampshire to stay?
Did they catch you at the border
And send you to back down?
Should I give up and stop looking around
Cause I'm still waiting to this day
Josaphine, Josaphine


Josaphine the fair
Josaphine the fair
