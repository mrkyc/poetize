I never been to London
You never been to Spain
I never been to war, you never been to prison
But we never been the same

After all is said and done
There was so much more to relate
Now the world will never know
Just what it lost that day

Give me some hotdamn
Give me some birdman
Give me some Proud Mary
The one with Claudia Lennear
Give me that mixtape
Give me those school days
Give me some hard cider, the one we did not mean to make

I was never beaten down like you were
I got to grow up in your wake
Momma always protected you
And dad was my ticket away

And after all that was said and done
There was so much more to relate
Now the world will never know
Just what it lost that day

Give me some hotdamn
Give me some birdman
Give me some Proud Mary, the one with Claudia Lennear
Give me that mixtape
Give me those school days
Give me some hard cider, the one we did not mean to make

In prison there was more drugs than I ever seen
And they let me stay out all night and trip the starlight 'til my soul was clean
And when I got out, I began my journey to the east
As they were filling you up with pills

Give me some hotdamn
Give me some birdman
Give me some Proud Mary
The one with Claudia Lennear
Give me that mixtape
Give me those school days
Give me some hard cider, the one we did not mean to make
Give me that long skate
Give me that heartache
Give me some Proud Mary the one with Claudia Lennear
Give me that penalty kill
Give me some big chill
