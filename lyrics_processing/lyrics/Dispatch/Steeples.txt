I heard a story about a boy who was swept off the deck
The sweeping tide swept the sea over his neck
But it did not end there, the boy began to swim
And dared to the sea that dared to invade him
Chorus:
Did you ever want to know me and
Did you ever feel like I could and
Did you ever want to know me and
Did you ever feel like I could
Its a silent steeple that carries us down
Its a silent steeple whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Verse 2:
But the sea would not so much as reply
So the boy yelled to the ships that were fated to die
Red sky at night, sailors take delight
Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning
Chorus:
Did you ever want to know me and
Did you ever feel like I could and
Did you ever want to know me and
Did you ever feel like I could
Its a silent steeple that carries us down
Its a silent steeple
Sail on (take it back) X7

Here we were goin with the wind in our hair
And we didn't wanna look back cause if we did well we would not care
And if we are to die now well it wouldn't be that bad
Cause that boy in the waves said he'd give us everything
Everything he had
To go on and trace that scar like we did ten years before
Did you ever want to know me and
Did you ever feel like I could and
Did you ever want to know me and
Did you ever feel like I could
Its a silent steeple that carries us down
Its a silent steeple
Sail on (take it back) X7
