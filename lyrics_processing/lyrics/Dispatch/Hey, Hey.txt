Well I'm moving kinda slow
Down that same old, path
Wastin time inside this, hour glass
She's commin up ahead now and I feel
Yes I feel
My head turnin like a, race car wheel
Maybe I'll try, to say hi another time
I gotta find a way, to get inside your mind
I'll talk smooth, walk one step closer
Be real cool, real cool, real cool, real cool...
Dang, real cool
Say what you want
Say what you mean
Question yourself, are you really what you seem
Say who you are
Say what you mean
Question yourself, are you really what you dream
Now here I come one more time...
But she slides on by
Not even a second look
She took the bait
Right off that hook
See Dispatch LiveGet tickets as low as $26You might also likeI've got my blinders on tight
I pull my cap a little lower
I can't hide...hide...away...
You might think this is easy for me
But there's a lot of things
You don't know
You don't care
You don't want to see
Long while since I got myself across
But maybe there's a reason for that
Even if I caught you, I'd throw you back
Say what you want
Say what you mean
Question yourself, are you really what you seem
Say who you are
Say what you mean
Question yourself, are you really what you dream

Well I really don't want to fall, back
Cause you don't seem like you care
And if I would
Fall (back)... back...
You don't seem like you care
Fall down your back
Fall down your back
Fall down your back
(You don't seem like you care)
Fall down your back
I will not, I will not hold.....
Hold you back
(You don't seem like, you care)
Fall....... Back..... You.... Don't.....
