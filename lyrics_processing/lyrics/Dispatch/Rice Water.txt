It's time to wake up
We're already underway
See the moon and the river
Chases the train so close to where
We wanna be

But keep it tight
Hold your head in
There are eyes on the road
That'll do us in
And I can't go back again

Cause we don't even need rice
Like we don't need water
We don't even need eyes
We don't even need God
We don't even need peace
Like we don't need laughter
We don't even need guns
We don't even need war

Are you okay?
That was a rough one you had the other day
Do you care for a cup of tea?
It'll get you high and where
You wanna be

But keep it tight
Hold your head in
There are eyes on the road
That'll do us in
But keep it tight
Hold your head in
There are eyes on the road
That'll do us in
And I can't go back again

Cause we don't even need rice
Like we don't need water
We don't even need eyes
We don't even need God
We don't even need peace
Like we don't need laughter
We don't even need guns
But they love their war

So hold me up high like
Like I was your last friend in the world
And let me down easy
Hurt my arm tryna save that girl
You think she's alright?
You think someone grabbed her knees?
You think she gonna make it
Two days to go to the river please
But keep it tight
Hold your head in
There are eyes on the road
That'll do us in
But keep it tight
Hold your head in
There are eyes on the road
That'll do us
Sure to do us in
And I can't go back again

Cause we don't even need rice
Like we don't need water
We don't even need eyes
We don't even need God
We don't even need peace
Like we don't need laughter
We don't even need guns
But they love their war

We don't even need flags
Like we don't need color
We don't even need lies
But the lies are right
We don't even need roads
I see you thereafter, faster
Than the highest wall they'll build
Do you care for a cup of tea?
It'll get you high
