I was wounded. you can't take me there
'cause it was a crime that I was left, but will you go on without me?
I think I'll just walk myself to sleep
'cause I ain't working for your father, but I might as well be
I ain't looking for confusion, but it tends to follow me
You can come in to my house she said, if you do it quietly
But I said, there ain't no chance in that
Because I am listenin' to what you got
Put up your hands if you want me to stop
And I'll turn around, but I think you're crazy
If you think this happens a lot
Oh, do you like this?
Do you need someone to cover you
Just to show you what you missed?
Wounded, I will go if you go first
But I ain't gonna wait around, tell me how much is your dime worth
We got, ten minutes to get there
We got, ten minutes to go
Throw this one in for the money, 'cause the next one's for the next show
I ain't workin' for your father but I might as well be
I ain't looking for confusion, but it tends to follow me
You can come in to my house she said, if you do it quietly
But I said, there ain't no chance in that

So hey, where you goin'
Do you need somebody, somewhere to help you get on by
Cause I think you know who I am
I'm going to make this as fast as I can
Some people call me a push-shove man
I promise it won't take long, no, no, no, no
Just close your eyes and get in the van
