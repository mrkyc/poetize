Cause ya cut it ya match it
Ya cut it ya match it
You do the final cut yea
Ya cut it ya match it
Ya cut it ya match it
You do the final cut yea

Cause it's a manifest destiny like a genocide recipe
Telling lords that wrestle me to be my own race
Challenge your god, another drink of your chalice
Dont underestimate the fate of a preordained mass
Where are my boots and where the hell is my balance
The hell you did come down from your planet
To see a cocking of a gun
Oh come if you're gunna get some
Cause forty seconds later and the cocking of a gun
A boy avoids confusion and his special agent scum
Two officers pushed a boy down on his back
Searched through his pockets found a vile of crack yea
This boy untainted
Its a typical mythical world we live in untaint me
Un-slay me, un-lay me
Going to the river cause I think I'm damn ready

I'd like to jettison your medicine back to where you came from
You keep your bell and eddison away from my grandson
Stand son on your own bone dont forget the home that you came from
Dont let them say your name wrong
Just like Larry i take it to the hoop
I on one false move in one fell swoop
Then i then i pass it to the trigger man
Bow down to the sound if you still can
Cause there's plenty of catcalls and plents of misfalls
And i can attest to the best of the pastfalls
Never ever have I had to make match with sickness
Look both ways dispatch with a quickness
Gimmie some roy, gimmie some speed
Gather all around to the word and read on
Till you get to the parts that's righteous
It's an unbearable likness

There is a river where riverbed should be

My name is Chetro and I do know
That I gotta get some money to get the van toed
His name is Braddigan and im back again
I wanna be that three with a tight plan
His name is Pete repeat Pete's got the goods
Spanking on my bass like I know I should
Lost in the draw for the freak and groom
