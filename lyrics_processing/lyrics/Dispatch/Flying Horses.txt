And in my hands I held it and I knew I was on my own
So I picked it up, and held it to the sky
And in my reflection I knew I was all alone
Then I saw this girl with the most beautiful hair
She had it wrapped around her for clothes she did not wear
I asked her for a lock and she complied, after leaving
Gorgeous footsteps in the sand as if she didn't care
Well
She was the prettiest girl I ever saw
The stone lay still without a flaw
The feelings I had defied the law
As I came to, I went to
And I took a look, a look down the road
To see a badger and a one eyed toad
They didn't say a word, they just looked at me
With that wise old look of the old
Wise old look of the old
Then I went down to town (then I went down to town)
To my favorite merry-go-round
To the place where magic horses fly
And you seldom see a frown, no you don't

But then I stole a ring from the flying horses
And I can't begin to explain how
I stole a ring from the flying horses
And it's all rusty now
I stole a ring from the flying horses
And I can't begin to explain how
I stole a ring from the flying horses
And it's all rusty now

And that lock of hair flew away with the wind
If you chance to meet upon either
Well you know where they've been
But don't pick them up or try to find me
They're much happier to be on their own
Beauty like that knows no home
And then if you take a look, a look down the road
You'll see a badger and a one eyed toad
They won't say a word they'll just look at you
With that wise look of the old
