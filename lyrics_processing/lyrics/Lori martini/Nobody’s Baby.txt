Yay yay yea ay

Saw you in the club and kissed you when I was drunk
So why you blowin' up my phone sayin' you're in love
Don'tcha know the difference between a buzz
Baby I was just havin' a little fun

When you see my waving hello
I'm really waving goodbye
Trust me when I say to you
That I'm really not your type
I'm not lookin' for a ball and chain
Cos I'm a freak baby and I do what I like
That's right that's right
That's right that's right
Listen when I say to you

That's a wrap so let me put it bluntly
I was only pretending
Cos I'm nobody's baby
Nobody's baby
Give it up cos you're never gonna have me
I was only being friendly
Cos I'm nobody's baby
Nobody's baby
You might also like
All them other girls are lookin' for mr. right
To put a rock on their finger but that's not I
I like to be on my own risky business
Dance til the sun rises
Roll the dice and see what happens
Cos I'm nobody's baby yeah yeah yeah

When you see my waving hello
I'm really waving goodbye
Trust me when I say to you
That I'm really not your type
I'm not lookin' for a ball and chain
Cos I'm a freak baby and I do what I like
That's right that's right
That's right that's right
Listen when I say to you

That's a wrap so let me put it bluntly
I was only pretending
Cos I'm nobody's baby
Nobody's baby
Give it up cos you're never gonna have me
