Let's go, let it go
Give it all you got
Like the comeback kid
We're gonna rise to the top
Amazing, wanna win
Put on a show
Hit the road then you know
That we're coming on home
And yeah we let you down
Yeah we hit rock bottom
But we'll come around
Until we hear the roar
Of the screaming crowd
And it's okay it's alright
I don't wanna stop
Until I win this fight
You just gotta believe
Just gotta believe
Just wait and see
Wait and see

You just gotta believe (gotta believe)
If you want a spot at the top of the league
The opposite team will try and impede
Your flow
But there will the season go?
If you don't believe in victory
In making history
In living the dream
Popping the cork
Celebrate at the top of the sport
Fixated on the crown
Haters y'all can back down
There goes another one laughing now
Motivated by the sound
Keep the faith
Each mistake gotta be embraced
A lesson is learned, a history is told
A warrior's road to glory and gold

You just gotta believe

Just wait and see
Wait and see
You just gotta believe

Just wait and see
Wait and see
You just gotta believe
Just gotta believe
