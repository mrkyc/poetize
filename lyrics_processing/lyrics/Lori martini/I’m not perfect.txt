I wanted all my pain to portray what my words could not say
Cause I'll never be good enough
They see my tears and call my bluff
Gotta tough it out and suck it up to stay, to stay
Keep on runnin to the top, no time to breathe, no time to stop
But I...

Gotta shut the world out and breakdown so I can see what's left of me
Time for me to be alone, where I feel home and remember what I believe
I just wanna cry out loud, cuz it's the only sound that will truly set me
Free
I'm standing still to say to you, I'm not perfect
Just thought you should know
So hard I can't find my way and I'm tired of all this rain
I'm damaged and so ashamed, only half my soul remains
Cause I'll never be pretty enough
They see my tears and call my bluff
Gotta tough it out and suck it up to stay, to stay
Keep on runnin to the top, no time to breathe, no time to stop
But I...

Gotta shut the world out and breakdown so I can see what's left of me
Time for me to be alone, where I feel home and remember what I believe
I just wanna cry out loud, cuz it's the only sound that will truly set me
Free
I'm standing still to say to you I'm not perfect, perfect
You might also likeOoh, I'm so afraid, so afraid
Of change, change
And ooh, I know it's the only way

Gotta shut the world out and breakdown so I can see what's left of me
Time for me to be alone, where I feel home and remember what I believe
What I believe
I just wanna cry out loud cuz it's the only sound that will truly set me
Free
It will set me free
I'm standing still to say to you I'm not perfect, perfect
Just thought you should know
