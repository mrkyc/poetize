But ladies, I thought you might like to know
That if you need sex, then look no further
'Cause right here is a pro
Now don't put me in a category of other men
Who've bragged and not come through
Because they may have pork or a little lamb
But I got the big beef for you, now let me tell ya
If inches are what you want then don't worry
'Bout a thing girl, I got nine along with two hands
Ten fingers and a tongue that'll send chills up your spine
I'll lick you in so many places
You'll wonder where in the hell I've been
And I'll twist that ass into some positions
That I know it ain't been in
Girl, I'm gonna freak you
And I'mma freak you real good
That's right girl, I'm gonna freak you
Freak you like a good man should
Now tell me, ain't you tired of laying down
All wet and set for fun
And then you find that the frank your homeboy has
Is too small to fit the bun
And when he finally does get it up
He cums prematurely, rolls over
All out of breath and swears he fucked you to death
For two minutes, or maybe three
These boys don't know how to please you
They can't give what you deserve
They feel exotic sex is nasty
You do too? Bitch, you got nerve
They don't know that a woman's body
Is delicious to the taste
And it needs much more than some male whore
Or a sucker with a pretty face
You might also likeGirl, I'm gonna freak you
Yeah, I'mma gonna freak you real good
Girl, I'm gonna freak you
And I'mma freak you like a good man should
Bust a move, I'm talking hardcore, steamy sex
Let loose and show no shame
I'll tie you to the bed with your two legs spread
And we'll play the whip cream game
I'll have you climbing up the walls
And I won't let up 'til you're on the ceiling
So get your hands from between your legs
And call Caz when you need some sexual healing
Now I know that there are those of you
Who might think this is a lie
And that's something you'll never know
Unless you give me a try
So if you think that I'm just talking shit
Or if you feel that I don't know how
Just stop the grinnin', drop the linen
And I'll make you cum right now
Girl, I'm gonna freak you
Me and you, love; bed, couch, or the kitchen
Your house or mine is fine because I'm
Cold itchin' to kick it, lick it, stick it to you
Straight through you, do you wanna scream hallelujah
Climb walls, no one does it better or makes it wetter
Soon as you take off that sweater
Bra, panties, et cetera
I'll put the tongue to work instead of the
Finger, bring a feeling that'll linger on
Keep you coming 'til the juice is gone
