Aww yeah, alright now that's what I wanted
It's on like applesauce man, um
Yo Caz  some of that old homeboy shit man
That's cool yo, but why don't you do that new shit that you did in the elevator?
Oh, you mean  did the other day?
Word yo
Alright, I'ma check it off like this

Yo, ain't no gamin'
So nobody play nothin'
GM is taxin', now you gotta pay somethin'
Say something punk, get your head put out
You want a trip? I'll stick my foot out
But you don't wanna go toe to toe
With the all-pro, step to me? No
That ain't the procedure, don't step to my station
And  who's first and reverse the rotation
Against the grain, refrain from using your brain
That's lame, no pain no gain
This ain't a joke son, I'm talkin' grounds for wildin'
No Fantasy Island and I ain't smilin'
I'm Caz, I'm not the one to game on
I'll be the one who makes him write your name on
The graveyard  signed rest in peace
And your eulogy read in church by a priest
So save face, no smilin'
I keep on pilin', bodies all on the top of the other
Then I rest for a while
And I lamp and don't break camp
Until the rap jam gets panties damp
Then I'm outtie like Curt Gowdy
A 500 Audi, time to get rowdy, no doubty
The jam is packed like clothes in a suitcase
Some lookin' good and some like fruitcake
But that don't make a difference if you doubt my veracity
Watch what I do to a house that's full to capacity
 you see is what I thrive on
Tell me where I'm goin' and I'll always arrive on time
A  in glasses
Some back stage passes for girls with asses
And Caz is about to get busy
