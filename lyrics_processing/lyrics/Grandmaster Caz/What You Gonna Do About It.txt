You got it made in the shade at the top of the heap
You took the sucker way up and sold yourself cheap
Just born and got on without paying no dues
So now you get taxed, beat, battered, and bruised
Because I chilled for a while till I got bored
Now that I'm back, learn how to act or you face the lord
I'm gonna slay you like a dragon with my takeout sword
Got all you suckers' pictures on my dartboard
'Cause since you've been down you been riding free
Now it's about time to face reality
'Cause I'm a rapping roadblock so get your route rerouted
I'm back, now what you gonna do about it?

I hope you stashed some money and a couple of tramps
'Cause I'ma break you so hard you'll need food stamps
I'm gonna take what you got until you're no longer hot
And lock your ass in a dungeon till you rot
I'm gonna come to your shows, scoop up all your hoes
Except the ones that are burnt, you keep those
You're gonna pay me punk dues till the day you die
When I say "Jump," all I wanna hear is "How high?"
I'll have you maytagging, hanging my socks on the line
You like sneakers so much? Here punk, wash mine
You think you're that good? Homeboy, I doubt it
I'm dissing, now what you gonna do about it?

I'm the MC terrorist, the rhyme commando
The real rap assassin with the skills of Rambo
I'm as slick as a fox, quick as a jack in the box
I'll knock ya out of your shoes and knock ya out your socks
'Cause my wrath is deadly, my rap is poison
And even though you tried to brainwash the boys and girls
They'll see through you when the word is spoken
By the rhyming lord of rap, so yo, here's a token
Hop on the train or you can take the bus
Then run with the bums but never with us
'Cause somebody's gotta go, this town's too crowded
I'm staying, now what you gonna do about it?

I'm leaving
I'm leaving
Ru-run
Ru-ru-run
