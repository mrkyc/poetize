Said hey y'all, yes it's true
The Grandmaster Caz gonna rock for you
Tear the roof off the sucker, but before I do
I want you to bust a move
I said hey y'all, yes it's true
The Grandmaster Caz gonna rock for you
I got routines, rhymes, and dances too
So what you wanna do?

First you call me daddy, I'll call you son
'Cause you're a baby of the '80s and I'm from day one
Yes I work with the men, you play with the boys
Now ain't you glad I left you my old toys
Old rhymes I used to say, '78 Caz
You ain't the first one to bite 'em and you won't be the last
And the gear and the gold that you flash with a smile
I used to wear before it was the style
And your girl, she's kinda sexy, not bad at all
Casanova had her over and we had a ball
She didn't tell you, I knew her since she was a pup
That's why I'm first man out the dugout and you bat cleanup
'Cause I lead and you follow
And I lend and you borrow
You're a stream and I'm the deep blue sea
I'm what is and you're what wants to be

Hey y'all, yes it's true
The Grandmaster Caz gonna rock for you
Tear the roof off the sucker, but before I do
I want you to bust a move
I said hey y'all, yes it's true
The Grandmaster Caz gonna rock for you
I got routines, rhymes, and dances too
So what you wanna do?

If the juice is the Grand then she'll need more than a cup
Now you may mayonnaise or mustard but you'll never ketchup
The only thing we have in common is we both rap
But you just joined the race and I'm in my twelfth lap
'Cause I'm hot as a furnace and cool as the Fonz
I'm taking gold, you rock the silver and bronze
I'm Captain on a yacht while you just swim
And you can play with little girls while I freak women
'Cause I create and you learn
I light a match and you burn
I'm not you and you damn sure ain't me
I'm what is and you're what wants to be

I said hey y'all, yes it's true
The Grandmaster Caz gonna rock for you
Tear the roof off the sucker, but before I do
I want you to bust a move
I said hey y'all, yes it's true
The Grandmaster Caz gonna rock for you
I got routines, rhymes, and dances too
So what you wanna do?
You use my as a guide, my rhymes are built in
You sleep in a shack, I max at the Hilton
You follow the leader, Caz is his own man
You just a boy and I'm a grown man
A legend, rap immortal, and you're just good
And when my album's platinum, yours will be wood
I got an army of followers while you got a crew
I'm number one, you're 702
You play with peashooters and I got guns
And the rappers you admire are my sons
I'm from the Boogie Down Bronx and I got soul
Another rapper couldn't touch me with a ten-foot pole
I get paid, you get jerk
You do chores, I do work
I perform and you just MC
I'm what is and you're what wants to be

I said hey y'all, yes it's true
Grandmaster Caz gonna rock for you
Tear the roof off the sucker, but before I do
I want you to bust a move
I said hey y'all, yes it's true
Grandmaster Caz gonna rock for you
I got routines, rhymes, and dances too
So what you wanna do?
