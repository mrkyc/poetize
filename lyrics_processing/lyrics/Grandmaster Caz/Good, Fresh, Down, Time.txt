Fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh
Down
Time
Good, fresh
I never act conceited, don't brag or boast
But when it comes to rhymes, I've got the most
More than anyone else in the MC biz
So if they ask you who's the best, hey, tell 'em who it is
Me, the Captain, or GMC
Either way you spell it out, it equals me
I got the soul of a singer, the beat of a drummer
And I didn't get to be number one on a hummer
Dedication, ambition, and hours of thought
Plus the use of the knowledge that I've been taught
A large vocabulary, good comprehension
And a gift from the Lord for getting people's attention
Because I rhyme so (good) and I look so (good)
And I dress so (good), I make love so (good)
And I dance so (good), I make you feel so (good)
My whole crew is (good), you wish you was this (good)
(Go-go-good)
Corporate traitors step off, and all you fronters stay back
And bums, I'm coming at you with a counterattack
You might as well snap out of it, grab hold of your senses
Not you or no one else can penetrate my defenses
I'm solid as a tank, I can't be moved
The king of rhyme, one of a kind, I've already proved
To be the best at what I do, a fearless leader
Not to mention rated 10 on the freak meter
Give a hundred percent when I do my thing
And I always give you something worth remembering
So before you even try, check out the Cap of the Foursome
And then you'll know the true definition of awesome
You might also likeBecause I talk so (fresh) and I walk so (fresh)
And I act so (fresh) and I rap so (fresh)
I like to be (fresh) so won't you be (fresh)
So just call me (fresh) and let's all be (fresh)
(Fre-fre-fresh)
Now y'all can't compete so drop out of the meet
And I'm not just saying this out of conceit
It ain't nothin' new, it's just the way I do
'Cause I can pop much shit and back it up too
'Cause I never look bummy, don't walk like a dummy
Don't stand on the stage and freeze like a mummy
Don't steal no rhymes, don't bite no lines
Matter of fact, most of y'all is biting mine
'Cause I'm second to none, I jock no one
I got a school if you wanna learn how it's done
Get your diploma fast, bring your books to class
And you can take rap lessons from the Grandmaster Caz
(Do-down)
Because you know I'm (down), straight up and (down)
And you wanna be (down) a-but you can't be (down)
I'll knock you (down) and I'll rock you (down)
So don't sit (down), everybody get (down)
(Down)
Yes I'm Grandmaster Caz, the best you can get
And if you can't say something nice then don't say shit
People stop where they're talking, joking, and kissing
Like E.F. Hutton, when I talk, people listen
I'm sharp as a tack and cool as a breeze
And everything I do is done with the greatest of ease
And I prove beyond a shadow of any doubt
That there ain't a MC that I can't take out
My rhymes are tough, not simple stuff
Not a lot of little phrases other people made up
So break up your rookie records, scatter them in the breeze
Go through the Wiz or Crazy Eddie and buy ten of these
(Time, time, time, time) Put 'em on your turntable (time)
And play 'em all the (time) or when you got the (time)
So don't forget next (time) because I'm right on (time)
Tell me what's the (time), I'll see you all next (time)
'Cause it's about that (time) and I'm out of
(Ti-time-ti-time-ti-ti-ti-ti-time)
Stand, so I'll pick
And if I can't lick
I'm gonna kiss
