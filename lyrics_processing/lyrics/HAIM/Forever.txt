Hey, you, oh, remember me? Remember love?
Remember trying to stay together?
My time, oh, you took it all, you tried to see
You tried to bring yourself up without involving me
It isn't fair to have your way
To try and get up and go, oh, na-na, na-na-na, now
Can't you see? It isn't fair to have your way
But I'm trying to get your attention, I need you to know that

Hey, you, hey, you, can't you make this sane?
I know, I know, I know you ain't the one to play the game
Now, I know I, I'm never gonna go your way
If you go, oh, now, I know, I know, know, know

Forever we tried to make it right
But together, we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word, then I'll say goodbye
Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No, I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right
You might also like
I don't wanna turn around, so come on, baby
Come on and try to let it out
Let go, we're still the same, so come on, baby, trigger the sound
Let's figure it out, let's get back to where we started out

Hey, you, hey, you, can't you make this sane?
I know, I know, I know you ain't the one to play the game
Now, I know I, I'm never gonna go your way
If you go, oh, now, I know, I know, know, know

Forever we tried to make it right
But together, we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word, then I'll say goodbye
Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No, I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right

Go, go, go, go, get out, get out of my memory
No, no, no, not tonight, I don't have the energy
Go, go, go, go, get out, get out of my memory
No, no, no, not tonight, oh, not tonight, oh, not tonight
Forever we tried to make it right
But together, we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word, then I'll say goodbye
But forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No, I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right
Forever we tried to make it right
But together, we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word, then I'll say goodbye
Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No, I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right

Forever we tried, forever we tried (Tried, tried, yeah)
Forever we tried, forever we tried (Tried, tried, yeah)
Forever we tried, forever we, forever we tried (Tried, tried)
