It was a weight on my shoulders
A strain on my back
But I loved to have you right there by my side
(You couldn't take it, you couldn't take it)
It used to be when we were alone
We shared such beautiful moments
(But lately it's been such a mess)
(You couldn't take it, you couldn't take it)

Go on and say it
Was my love too much for you to take?
I guess you never knew what was good for you
Ooh, don't keep me waiting
Say the words that you're too scared to say
I guess you never knew what was good for you
I need to hear you say it
Was my love too much for you to take?
I guess you never knew what was good for you
Ooh, don't keep me waiting
Say the words that you're too scared to say
I guess you never knew what was good for you

I came home to see you
You weren't around
Excuses were one right after the other
(You couldn't take it, you couldn't take it)
You woke up from another dream
Another fight you didn't mean
Still, time after time, I came running to get you
(You couldn't take it, you couldn't take it)

Was my love too much for you to take?
I guess you never knew what was good for you
Ooh, don't keep me waiting
Say the words that you're too scared to say
I guess you never knew what was good for you
I need to hear you say it
Was my love too much for you to take?
I guess you never knew what was good for you
Ooh, don't keep me waiting
Say the words that you're too scared to say
I guess you never knew what was good for you

(You couldn't take it)
Another heart, another day
So much time just thrown away
(You couldn't take it)
You know I love to be in love
(You couldn't take it)
So tired of trying to show you
I work so hard

Go on and say it
Was my love too much for you to take?
I guess you never knew what was good for you
Ooh, don't keep me waiting
Say the words that you're too scared to say
I guess you never knew what was good for you
I need to hear you say it
Was my love too much for you to take?
I guess you never knew what was good for you (Oh, baby)
Ooh, don't keep me waiting
Say the words that you're too scared to say
I guess you never knew what was good for you
I guess you never knew
I guess you never knew what was good for you
I guess you never knew
I guess you never knew what was good for you
I guess you never knew
I guess you never knew what was good for you
I guess you never knew
