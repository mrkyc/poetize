Countin' the hours
With nothing to say
Goin' through the motions
It's slippin' away
We were so gallant
So unafraid
Sleeping back to back
You're turnin' away

How could you tell me nothing's wrong?
(T-tell me)
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong
(T-tell me)
It was good, but now it's gone
(T-tell me)
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong
(T-tell me)
How could you tell me nothing's wrong?
(T-tell me)
Go on, tell me what you want
(T-tell me)
Were you tellin' me all along?
(T-tell me)
Just tell me nothing's wrong
You might also like
Sign of the times
Signs of your crimes
Thinking about the other night
Was it all in my mind?
I was so foolish
I was so blind
Why do we do this to each other, baby?
Heartbreak by design
(One, two, three, four)

How could you tell me nothing's wrong?
(Just tell me, baby)
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong
(Could you tell me nothing's wrong?)
It was good, but now it's gone
(Gone, baby)
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong
(T-tell me nothing's wrong)
How could you tell me nothing's wrong?
(Just tell me, baby)
Go on, tell me what you want
(T-tell me)
Were you tellin' me all along?
(T-tell me)
Just tell me nothing's wrong
(T-tell me)
It's obvious, be honest
It's obvious, be honest (Could you tell me nothing's wrong?)
It's obvious, be honest
It's obvious, be honest (Just tell me, baby)
It's obvious, be honest
Be honest, be honest

Tell me nothing's wrong
T-tell me nothing's wrong (Huh)
T-tell me nothing's wrong
Yeah, yeah

How could you tell me nothing's wrong?
(T-tell me)
Go on, tell me what you want
(T-tell me)
Were you tellin' me all along?
(T-tell me)
Just tell me nothing's wrong
(Just tell me, baby)
How could you tell me nothing's wrong?
(T-tell me)
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong
(T-tell me)
How could you tell me nothing's wrong?
(T-tell me)
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong
(T-tell me)
How could you tell me nothing's wrong?
(T-tell me)
