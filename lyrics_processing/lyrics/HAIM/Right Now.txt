Gave you my love, you gave me nothing
Said what I gave wasn't enough
You had me feeling I was foolish for ever thinking
This could be the one
I wasn't even in the running
Already had your mind made up
You left me searching for a reason why'd you leave
Left me in the dust

And now you're saying that you need me, babe
Right now, right now
Now you're saying that you need me, babe
Right now, right now
Now you're saying that you love me, love me, baby
Right now, right now
Now you're saying that you need me
Saying that you need me
Saying that you need me
Right now

Gave you my love, thought I could trust you
You let me down at every turn
You had me hanging on a dream you never believed
You gave me your word
Finally on the other side now
And I could see for miles
And I've forgotten every line
You might also like
Now you're saying that you need me, babe
Right now, right now
Ooh, now you're saying that you need me, babe
Right now, right now
Ooh, now you're saying that you love me, love me, baby
Right now, right now
Now you're saying that you need me
Saying that you need me
Saying that you need me
Right now

Did you think this would be easy?
(You thought it would be easy)
Thought this would be easy
(I wish it was easy)
Not now, not now
I know you heard me through an open window
Whispers carried to your ear
Whispers sounded so clear

Somehow it's so clear now
Somehow it's so clear now
What's that sound?
That's you fading away
Now you're saying that you need me, babe
Right now, right now
Mmm, now you're saying that you need me, baby
Right now, right now
Ooh, now you're saying that you love me, love me, baby
Right now, right now
And now you're saying that you need me
Saying that you need me
Saying that you need me
Right now
And now you're saying that you need me, babe
Right now, right now
Ooh, now you're saying that you need me, babe
Right now, right now
Ooh, now you're saying that you love me, love me, baby
Right now, right now
And now you're saying that you need me
Saying that you need me
Saying that you need me
Right now

Right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
