I never wanna see you again with the beating of my heart witness
I say "No, no, no, no, I'm done I'm done"
I never wanna see you again with the beating of my heart witness
I say "No, no, no, no, I'm done I'm done"

Getting back to it
Oh, I'm getting back to everything I had
Before you came around
You fucked me up, what am I do to now?
But in my mind I keep seeing you, seeing me
And how good we used to be
Used to be, used to be, used to be, used to be
I keep seeing it, seeing me
And how good we used to be
Used to be, used to be, used to be, used to be

And now I'm finding I cannot deal with this
Going crazy, wanna go leave, you want in
Say you wanna work this out, boy?
Don't need to beg cause you'll never get it again

'Cause I'm better off this time so not this time
No baby, not this time around
Oh, I'm better off this time so not this time
'Cause I found out yeah, I found out now

Forgiveness
Is that all you want from me?
I won't fall into the arms of the one who turned on me
It's getting too dark for me to see
So I'll  keep flashing back to when we met, we were
Better then, better then, better then, better then
I held you, I didn't have to share it then
Better then, better then, better then, better then

Now my mind is taking me back to this
Too much time to think about what it is
What made us fall apart
Well, you don't need to beg 'cause you'll never get it again

'Cause I'm better off this time so not this time
No, no, no not this time around
Oh, I'm better off this time so not this time
'Cause I found out yeah I found out now

I'm better off this time so not this time
No baby, not this time around
Oh, I'm better off this time, so not this time
'Cause I found out, yeah, I found out now
Oh you know I'm better off this time, better off this time
Oh you know I'm better off this time, better off this time
Oh you know I'm better off this time
'Cause I found out, I found out now
Oh you know I'm better off this time, better off this time
Oh you know I'm better off this time, better off this time
Oh you know I'm better off this time
