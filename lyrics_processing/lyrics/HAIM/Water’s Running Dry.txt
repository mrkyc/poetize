We were thinking we were wise
There was a moment, you and I
We saw it stretch across our lives
Thinking we could make it if we tried
And now this car won't drive this road
There are some things I should've known
There are some things on my mind
But I won't pick up the line

'Cause I don't have the heart to admit
I don't wanna finish what we started
I think you could be an honest man
But I'm a woman who's just too guarded
We know it's a big mistake
Like the other ones we made
Nothing left to do but let it lie
Let's not wait till water's running dry

Now I don't wanna compromise
'Cause, baby, both of us have tried
You know it hurts me letting go
It hurts me more than I can show
I close my eyes, see an open road
There are some things I wanna know
There are some things on my mind
But I don't know how to see it right
You might also like
'Cause I don't have the heart to admit
I don't wanna finish what we started
I think you could be an honest man
But I'm a woman who's just too guarded
We know it's a big mistake
Like the other ones we made
Nothing left to do but let it lie
Let's not wait till water's running dry

Don't wait up for me
I'm not coming home
I'm not tired
Gonna drive all night
Don't wait up for me
I'm not answering my phone
I'm headed north on the 5 till it's light
Don't wait for me, don't wait for me
Might not hear from me for a while

'Cause I don't have the heart to admit
We can never finish what we started
You couldn't be an honest man
So how could I be the woman you wanted?
It took us so long to find
What was always there in our eyes
Nothing left to do but cut the line
