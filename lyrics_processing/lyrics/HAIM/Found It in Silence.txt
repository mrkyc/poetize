I wanted an honest man
I thought I found one of them
Stood by him every time I was scared
I was blind, wasn't I?
Thought he was a modest man
Who could put me back together again
Tried so hard to read his mind through his eyes
I was scared, I was blind

But I found it in silence, finally see
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
I found it in silence, finally see
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me

Three fingers on the edge
You always talked me down in the end
Made me think you were right all this time
Not this time, not this time
Both of us holding back
But you were the most guilty of that
Someone else on your mind all this time
I was right, wasn't I?
You might also like
You told me, "Don't walk away"
You told me not to walk away
You told me not to walk, walk, walk, walk, walk
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk

But I found it in silence, finally see (I finally see)
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
I found it in silence, finally see (I finally see)
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
I found it in silence (Found it in silence), finally see (Finally see)
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
Found it in silence (Found it in silence), finally see (Finally see)
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me

It was always for the better
And I guess I should've known
The truth is it's your issue
I know I need to let it go
And though I have found happiness
In a life that's truly mine
You'd think I could just laugh it off
But it gets me every time
Found it in silence
Found it in, found it in silence
Found it in, found it in silence
Found it in, found it in silence
Found it in, found it in silence, finally see
Found it in silence, finally
Found it in silence, finally see
Found it in silence, finally
Ooh, oh, baby

I found it in silence, finally see
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
I found it in silence, finally see
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
I finally see (I found it in silence, finally see)
I know what's good for me (There's no turning back, I know what's good for me)
I finally see (I know what's good for me) (I found it in silence, finally see)
I know what's good for me (There's no turning back, I know what's good for me)
I finally see (I found it in silence, finally see)
I know what's good for me (There's no turning back, I know what's good for me)
I finally see (I found it in silence, finally see)
