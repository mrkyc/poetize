On the way down
A fall from grace
I was in for a heavy one
When I could feel you pull away
On the way down
It all was too much to take
Even though I tried, it was never enough
We're running in the same damn place

But I never stopped or gave up
I couldn't ever let you go
'Cause in the end
I was innocent, I was innocent
I know you know that it's no good
But you could never say it first
I know you're hurt
Tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel

'Cause I've got something to tell you
But I don't know why
It's so hard to let you
Know that we're not seeing it eye to eye
Because I know if I tell you
That everything's alright
We could stay in this moment
And never say goodbye
Oh, never say goodbye
You might also like
Heavy was the sound
I could not lift
I could run for a million miles
And never get away from it
But knowing that now
I couldn't be content
Even when it was looking up for us
It was difficult to pretend

I never stopped or gave up
I couldn't ever let you go
'Cause in the end
I was innocent, I was innocent
I know you know that it's no good
But you could never say it first
I know you're hurt
Tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel

'Cause I've got something to tell you
But I don't know why
It's so hard to let you
Know that we're not seeing it eye to eye
Because I know if I tell you
That everything's alright
We could stay in this moment
And never say goodbye
Oh, never say goodbye
I never stopped or gave up
I couldn't ever let you go
'Cause in the end, mm (I was innocent)
I never stopped or gave up
I couldn't ever let you go
'Cause in the end, baby (I was innocent)
I never stopped or gave up
I couldn't ever let you go
'Cause in the end, I was innocent, I was innocent (I was innocent)
I know you know that it's no good
But you could never say it first
I know you're hurt
Tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel (Tell me how you feel)

'Cause I've got something to tell you
But I don't know why
It's so hard to let you
Know that we're not seeing it eye to eye
Because I know if I tell you
That everything's alright
We could stay in this moment
And never say goodbye
Oh, never say goodbye
But I don't know why (Tell me how you feel)
It's so hard to let you
Know that we're not seeing it eye to eye
Because I know if I tell you
That everything's alright (Tell me how you feel)
We could stay in this moment
And never say goodbye (Never say goodbye)
Oh, never say goodbye (Never say goodbye)
(Never say goodbye)
Oh, never say goodbye
(Never say goodbye)
Oh, never say goodbye
(Never say goodbye)
(Never say goodbye)
Never say goodbye
Oh, never say goodbye
