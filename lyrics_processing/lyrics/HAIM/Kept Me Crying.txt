When you sleep, are you dreaming of me?
Hurts to say, but I'm always awake
If you want me, I'm waiting for you
If you call me, I'll pick up
Know I shouldn't, but I can't give up
'Cause you

Kept me crying for so long, my tears have dried
Still when I hear your voice, those tears, they come back to mind
So don't call me up just to tell me you don't love me anymore
Still it wrecks me 'cause

I was your lover
I was your friend
Now I'm only just someone you call
When it's late enough to forget
I was your lover
I was your friend
Now I'm only just someone you call
When it's late enough to forget

When you leave, I can't stop my heart hurting
Hurts to say I keep thinking you'll stay
If you want me, I'll be waiting for you
If you call me, I'll pick up
Know I shouldn't, but I can't give up
'Cause you
You might also like
Kept me crying for so long, my tears have dried
Still when I hear your voice, those tears, they come back to mind
So don't call me up just to tell me you don't love me anymore
Still it wrecks me 'cause

I was your lover
I was your friend
Now I'm only just someone you call
When it's late enough to forget
I was your lover
I was your friend
Now I'm only just someone you call
When it's late enough to forget
I've got no cover
I can't pretend
That I'm anything more to you now
Than someone who's hard to forget
And after all these tears
After all my years of trying
I don't wanna hear
That none of it meant anything

I was your lover
I was your friend
I was your lover
I was your friend
I was your lover
I was, I was your friend
I was your lover
I was your friend
I was, I was your lover, baby
I was, I was your lover, baby
I was (I was your lover)
I was (I was your friend)
I was (I was your lover)
I was (I was your friend)
I was (I was your lover)
I was (I was your friend)
I was, I was (I was your lover)
