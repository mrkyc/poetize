We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never fell so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
And all you did was wreck me

I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're never coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
You might also like
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
And all you did was wreck me

I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
All I wanted was to break your walls
And all you ever did was wreck me
Yeah you, you wreck me

I never meant to, I never meant to start a war
I never meant to, I never meant to start a war
I never meant to, I never meant to start a war
I never meant to, I never meant to start a war
I guess I should've, I guess I should've let you win
I guess I should've, I guess I should've let you win
I guess I should've, I guess I should've let you win
I guess I should've...

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never fell so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
And all you did was wreck me

I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
And all you did was wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
