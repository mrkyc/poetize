You think you know about me, well, I know me better
I'm not the girl who waits around just to be walked all over
I never tread the line, I never fell and I never lied
But I never thought that I could be the one to open my eyes

I know that
We'll be looking back one day
But I trust that I
Could never stay the same
When everything felt so wrong
It led me to where I belong
So now
I'm going home
Take me home, just take me home
Take me home

Home is a symphony and it's bittersweet when it's callin' me
Just another river deep, flowing to an ocean
I know that I may never know; the future, unpredictable
A hundred choices led me here, lessons learned with every tear
They take me home, take me home
Take me home, take me home
Hold it inside my heart
Just take me home
You might also like
I know that
We'll be looking back one day
But I trust that I
Could never stay the same
When everything felt so wrong
It led me to where I belong
So now (Now, now)
I'm going home
Take me home, just take me home
Take me home

Looking back on my life
The past is a mirror
I've left and come back
But what am I closer to? (I know that)
But what am I closer to? (We'll be looking back one day)
What am I closer to? (I hope that we)
What am I closer to? (Will never be the same)

I know that
We'll be looking back one day
But I trust that I (I trust that I)
I could never stay the same (I could never stay the same)
When everything felt so wrong
It led me to where I belong
So now (Now, now)
I'm going home
Take me home, just take me home
Take me home
Home is a symphony and it's bittersweet when it's callin' me
Just another river deep, flowing to an ocean
I know that I may never know; the future, unpredictable
A hundred choices led me here, lessons learned with every tear

They take me home, take me home
Take me home, take me home
I hold it inside my heart
