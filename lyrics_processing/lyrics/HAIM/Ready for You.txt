Maybe I was trying to forget
All my crazy reactions over my ex
Maybe you played way too hard to get
So I kept it moving to another one night stand, baby

I promise I will treat you right, treat you right, babe
'Cause that's all I wanna do, oh
I promise I will treat you right, treat you right, babe
So that's what I'm gonna do (That's what I'm gonna do)

I promise I'll treat you right
Been waiting my whole damn life
Baby, it's about time
I wasn't ready for you
Funny how this whole game played
Three years since I learned your name
The wrong time, the wrong place
I wasn't ready for you

Baby, I couldn't tell you why
Denied the first night I met you
When we were locking eyes
They said you'd be like all the other guys
Two-faced, but too numb to know it
Telling your pretty lies, babe
You might also like
But I promise I will treat you right, treat you right, babe
'Cause that's all I wanna do, oh
I promise I will treat you right, treat you right, babe
So that's what I'm gonna do (That's what I'm gonna do)

I promise I'll treat you right
Been waiting my whole damn life
Baby, it's about time
I wasn't ready for you
Funny how this whole game played
Three years since I learned your name
The wrong time, the wrong place
I wasn't ready for you

Keep thinking about you
Thinking you almost slipped through
There won't be another day I'll let you get away
I'll keep calling 'til your guard comes down
'Cause I wanna keep you around
'Cause we started something good
But just know that before you
I wasn't ready (For you)
I wasn't ready (For you)
When you first met me (For you)
That's what I'm gonna do
I wasn't ready
I wasn't ready for you, baby
I wasn't ready for you, baby
For you, baby
For you, baby
I wasn't ready for you
I promise I'll treat you right
Been waiting my whole damn life (Waiting my whole damn life)
Baby, it's about time
I wasn't ready for you (I wasn't ready, baby)
Funny how this whole game played
Three years since I learned your name
The wrong time, the wrong place
I wasn't ready for you

I wasn't ready, baby
I wasn't ready for you, baby
I wasn't ready
(I wasn't ready for you)
I wasn't ready, baby
I wasn't ready for you, baby
I wasn't ready
(I wasn't ready for you)
I wasn't ready
I wasn't ready, no
I wasn't ready
(I wasn't ready for you)
