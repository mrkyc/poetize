You came back, back into my arms like a heart attack-tack
With your certain charms coming right through my eyes
Over my body, a hand on my thigh
And I wanna make nice now that you're back to me
And I wanna do right by you with my whole being, come on baby
While I was star-gazing you were with the other one, but now

Cover your eyes, do I feel right darling?
Remember, want to make this right
Now that you're mine, do right by me
Baby, wanna feel you cross the line

So send me down, oh oh-eh-oh
I wanna push you around, oh oh-eh-oh oh-oh
Gonna send me down, oh oh-eh-oh
Se-send me, se-send me down
Se-send me, se-send me down
I wanna push you around, oh oh-eh-oh oh-oh
Se-send me, se-send me down
Se-send me, se-send me down

Back then, back when I could see you were my only friend
I was too scared that I couldn't let you in
Like a gambler, only playing to win
You might also like
Cover your eyes, do I feel right darling?
Remember, want to make this right
Now that you're mine, do right by me
Baby, wanna feel you cross the line

So send me down, oh oh-eh-oh
Se-send me, se-send me down
Se-send me, se-send me down
I wanna push you around, oh oh-eh-oh oh-oh
Se-send me, se-send me down
Se-send me, se-send me down
Se-send me, se-send me down
Gonna send me down, oh oh-eh-oh
Se-send me, se-send me down
Se-send me, se-send me down
I wanna push you around, oh oh-eh-oh oh-oh
Se-send me, se-send me down
Se-send me, se-send me down
