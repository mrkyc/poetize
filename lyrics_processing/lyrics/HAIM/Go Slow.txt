Go slow
So that I can hear everything you're saying
Now I know you're going
You just threw this away
You know I ain't gonna take it (Go slow)
But we ain't gonna make it (I know)
I can't make you stay

But I'll be hurting from the heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat
Heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat
Hurting from the heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat
Heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat

Well, well, was it something that I said?
I know that it was something I said (Yeah, yeah)
From your heat now
Going crazy trying hard to forget
You know I'm trying hard to forget (Yeah, yeah)
From your heat now
Oh, I just wanna go back, hold on
To the way that I was
'Cause you took away all my young life
And I hate who I've become
You might also like
From your heat now
From the heat, it's coming, coming

I know
I'm giving in and believing every lie
For now the moon is night
I turned off the light
And you shook up the foundation (Go slow now)
With your intimidation (I know)
Oh, when you turn away now

I hope you're hurting from the heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat
Heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat
Hurting from the heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat, heat
Heat, heat, heat, heat, heat

Well, well, was it something that I said?
I know that it was something I said (Yeah, yeah)
From your heat now
Going crazy trying hard to forget
You know I'm trying hard to forget (Yeah, yeah)
From your heat now
Oh, I just wanna go back, hold on
To the way that I was
'Cause you took away all my young life
And I hate who I've become
From your heat now
No
From your heat now
No
From your heat now, from your heat now
From your heat now, from your heat now, now, baby
Now, from your heat now, from your heat now
From your heat now, now, now, now, now

Well, well, was it something that I said?
I know that it was something I said (Yeah, yeah)
From your heat now
Well, I'm going crazy trying hard to forget
You know I'm trying hard to forget (Yeah, yeah)
From your heat now
Oh, I just wanna go back, hold on
To the way that I was
'Cause you took away all my young life
And I hate who I've become

From your heat now (Go back, go back, go back, go back)
(Go back, go back, go back, go back)
From your heat now (Go back, go back, go back, go back)
No (Go back, go back, go back, go back)
Oh, I just wanna go back (Go back)
Go back (Go back)
Go back (Go back)
Go back, I just wanna go back (Go back)
Go back
