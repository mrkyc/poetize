Chilling coming undone
Barely any gas but we'll be okay
Everybody outside
Will make fun of our style
I don't really care what people say
And you don't really know me
My mind's like a movie
And I'm praying you'll wanna come press play
You keep me distracted
I'm sorry for my actions
When you make me dance like I'm on display
Don't worry 'bout the other side
No reason we can't come alive
Your body's like a paradise
No stoppin' till I'm satisfied
Your body's like a paradise
No stoppin' till I'm satisfied
Don't brake my heart it's too much for me
I'll chase the sparks of your reality
(I'll dance as a distraction)
You tear me apart I can barely breathe
I'll dance through dark till you redeem me
(I'll dance as a distraction)
All these little moments
I loose all my focus
I hope this is not just in my head
You don't have to fake it
Imagine if we dated
Or we could just stay good friends instead
Don't worry 'bout the other side
No reason we can't come alive
Your body's like a paradise
No stoppin' till I'm satisfied
Your body's like a paradise
No stoppin' till I'm satisfied
Don't brake my heart it's too much for me
(No reason we can't come alive, when I'm awake you're by my side)
I'll chase the sparks of your reality
(I'll dance as a distraction)
You tear me apart I can barely breathe
(No reason we can't come alive, when I'm awake you're by my side)
I'll dance through dark till you redeem me
(I'll dance as a distraction)
Don't brake my heart it's too much for me
(No reason we can't come alive
When I'm awake you're by my side dance as a distraction)
I'll chase the sparks of your reality
(No reason we can't dance as a distraction dance as a distraction)
You tear me apart I can barely breathe
(No reason we can't come alive, when I'm awake you're by my side)
I'll dance through dark till you redeem me
(No reason we can't dance as a distraction dance as a distraction)
Don't worry 'bout the other side
No reason we can't come alive
Your body's like a paradise
