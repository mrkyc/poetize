Inside my sheets with the screen lighting up my face
I've got my life laid out in a visual space
See, in the real world, these brows are not on fleek
Winged liner ain't so easy, my look is pretty weak
But here online where I can do anything
The water's sold in boxes and O2L can sing
(Goals! Actual goals, AF)

Literally my life is
Beaches every single night, messy buns and Christmas lights
Literally my life is
Skinny waists and high fashion, riding in the G-Wagon
Literally my life is, literally my life is

Ooooooh weee!
I have everything reblogged on the screen
Ooooooh weee!
I have everything reblogged on the screen

So, back in real life, I still can't find a bae
My local coffee shop still messes up my name
Hey, let's get lost in one million pins and Tweets
I'll live my life like Kylie and buy expensive sweets
My nails will be too long to get done anything
I'll sip artistic lattes and rock expensive bling

Skinny waists and high fashion, riding in the G-Wagon
Literally my life is, literally my life is

Ooooooh weee!
I have everything reblogged on the screen
Ooooooh weee!
I have everything reblogged on the screen
:
(off-key) Wooo-eee-ooh heeyy
What? What? What's going on? What?
(doorbell)
Chris, what are you doing here?
If you get off your phone, you'd know
Holy chnizel! Come on, Chris, we've gotta go live life!

Literally my life is
Thrifting stores and hand me downs, picking graduation gowns
Literally my life is
Hitting up the drive-thru, got shotgun in mom's Subaru
Literally my life is, literally my life is
Living in my yoga pants, shaving for the school dance
Dealing with Alisha's rants
Homework by the fridge light, Netflix dates and pillow fights
2 a.m. on a summer night

Ooooooh weee!
I have everything right in front of me
Ooooooh weee!
