Somebody's getting murdered tonight...
Somebody's getting murdered tonight...

He's still here after all these years with the lost sinners
Cold blood stay frost from the north winters
Henny spilling out his cup on his four fingers
Battle voices in his head saying, "You're finished!"
Soul feeling like the old rust on the door hinges
Whore's throat, beat up and raspy like a tour singer's
The past wishing in his glass in the course lingers
Flashing memories, every splash of Hennessy
Heavy cash and enemy semi-blast the (?)
Answers back your messages bending back and hemorrhaging
Men in black with menacing looks meet the crook's fate
The simmering in his eyes until it cooks hate

The future's looking grimmer
He's feeling him or me while he's looking in the mirror
And maybe God forgive him or he don't
This kid is thinking he gon' see the morning living, but he won't

Somebody's getting murdered tonight
Somebody's gotta pay for this year
Somebody's gotta pay for this life
Somebody's getting murdered tonight
Somebody's getting murdered tonight
Somebody's gotta pay for this year
Somebody's gotta pay for this life
Somebody's getting murdered tonight

He's still here after all these years, with the derelicts
Black army jacket terrorist, reminisce
Over fallen soldiers, brothers in arms, colors and (?)
Rumbling war, where OGs crumble and fall
In a blizzard of bullets, might have been a hundred or more
Bullet holes puncture the wall, then rupture your skull
Fucking animals in the deadliest jungle of all
Disgusting cannibals, eating each others mothers of course
Hang her, slit her throat, throw a bucket under her corpse
Disrespect the dead fuck without the crutch of remorse
Witness death, another life crushed like dust in a storm
Pistols dressed with silencers to muffle applause
From the clapper

The future's looking grimmer
He's feeling him or me while he's looking in the mirror
And maybe God forgive him or he don't
This kid is thinking he gon' see the morning living, but he won't
