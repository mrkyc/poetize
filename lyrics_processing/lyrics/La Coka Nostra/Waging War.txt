Supreme magnetic, Green grab get it
Ski mask panic, chief athletic
Uzi blow, Superbowl, the game's to be sold
Blood in my veins is trained to be cold
'86 Gucci, the chain'll be gold
2016, a dick in every mouth of these hoes
La Coka Nostra, motherfucker, it's the life that we chose
Peep the concrete jungle holocaust
Combustible tomahawks and Molotov's
Welcome to the Monster's Ball
The worst is yet to come, hold the microphone like stone
Focus on chrome, spit it like a lava lamp exploded
And pasteurize your pain, granulate your hate, Amputated Saint shakes a cup full of random change
Standing in the rain, speaking truth
Listen close, your life depends on it
Fuck moving mountains, let's break reality and bend logic
Fuck the streets, life's bigger than that
And Death's watching, use my bare hands to intercept rockets
Spit on my cock, bitch!

Your prayers will never be heard at all
So what you praying for?
I'm a watch it all burn to the ground and fall
That's what you waiting for
Don't wait for nobody
Save yourself, I'm a fight when they find me
Don't wait for nobody
Save yourself cause I'm waging war
You might also like
Every breath in the mic is pestilent, the message is strife
We mastered the dark, it's effortless to step in the light
With the massacred heart of warriors impeccable might
A world war we got the weapons to fight
The story of the deception and resurrection of Christ
Judas kiss and betrayal, but who exists in this tale
So we learn a notorious lesson in life
Ruthlessness wears a veil that truth lies beneath
So who should prevail?
It's like the sight of red, violent visions living right inside his head
The weight of fate is heavy, but it's lighter than a spider's web
Side effects psychiatric drugs, where does he hide em next?
Crashing down a flight of steps, laughing at the sight of death
Staring in the face of evil, truly believers
Students underneath the tutelage of Julius Caesar
So I live among the vicious and I'm ruling the legions
Inspired by fire but trust me, I'm as cool as a freezer

Your prayers will never be heard at all
So what you praying for?
I'm a watch it al,l burn to the ground and fall
That's what you waiting for
Don't wait for nobody
Save yourself, I'm a fight when they find me
Don't wait for nobody
