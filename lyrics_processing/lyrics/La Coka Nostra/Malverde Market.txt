In a country gripped by violence, in a land plagued by gunfire and drug money, one focal figure stands above the rest. Tonight, see why the people of Mexico call him The Narco Saint...

In the midst of the Malverde Market
In the presence of The Narco Saint
The vodka drink, bottle smashed and the shotguns aimed
The Reaper calling was enough to put 2Pac in paint
Murals of dead heroes, apocalyptic rain
We look above at all the scriptures say
Which is why, which is way
Drift inside the smoke from the biscuit haze
I sniff and daze in the alley with my towel dirty
Nursing the stab wounds, catching visions of Malverde
I pissed away my life for years, look I'm now thirty
Product of pistoleers, rocking a foul jersey
Holding my side together, chopping up perico flakes
Maybe now is my time to head up to that peaceful place
But all's I picture is that last look on Chico's face
I should have seen it coming, those deceitful snakes
What happened after that I cannot say
I saw the face of Jesus, and then I woke up out in Santa Fe

Mexican officials have just detained a 14 year-old child assassin, who has admit to decapitating four people. Uh, his sister is also detained, because she is, basically admitting to dumping the bodies on freeways and rivers, doing whatever's necessary to get rid of the decapitated bodies

In the presence of The Narco Saint
La Coka Nostra tagged on the walls of the House of Pain
The Reaper calling was enough to leave your house in flames
Tattoos of deceased idols, killers gone insane
We look above it on the witness face
Jury with a bitter taste in their mouths
Division in the distant haze
The pistol blaze like hellfire
Bullets whistle by like voices beyond the grave in a dead choir
I pissed away my life for many moons
Many shitty wombs in pissy motels
Exchanging bricks with many goons
Exchanging bullet wounds with many fools
Been one of the most fortunate, though I've been tortured with impending doom
And all I picture is when me and God talk
Looking like Tim Roth from the ending of Reservoir Dogs
What happened after that I can't tell you
But if you keep the faith then even death can't fail you
