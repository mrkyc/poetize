Yo, I've been rhyming since my daddy's dick first got wet
Kicked a hole in the womb of my mother then I jet
Back to the scene of the crime
A true mastermind, I'll never do time

Nah, but I do watch my watch till the second hand stops
Till the bars close down and the records get dropped
Piss drunk in the parking lot, speaking dumb
Gun all sticky from the Puerto Rican rum

I keep it real like the '80s when we flooded the block
Stick-up kids went from baseheads to sucking the cock
The hottest bitch in my projects discovered the rock
A year later had the monster coming out of her twat

This is a stick-up, I told you, you could reach for the sky
Fuck a chip off the brick or the piece of the pie
The worst thing they did to the kid was leave him alive
Now I'm ruthless, moving with a reason to die

The trees got me so high, kid, sniff your next line
My culture's refined, I'm heavy on the grind
I'm hard in the paint, my Uzi weighs a kilo
I'll smack you in the face and crack your head like Cee-lo
You might also like
It's a fact, homie, eagles don't roam in flocks
But the Eagles that I got will put a hole in your top
So predictable, I'm already knowing your plot
It happens so fast you won't even know that you're shot

Until the concrete's painted with pain
Cause you being dead is the only way they'll ever say you were "Slaine"
Black scully, black bandana, and black coat
With the Cult Leader and the House of Pain

You already know what it is
It's the pimp, the sniff and the aw shit
That ain't dandruff homeboy
Hell naw, that ain't dandruff

All in together now - That's coke
All in together now - That's coke
All in together now - That's coke
All in together now - That's coke
All in together now - That's coke

That's coke in freezer bags hidden in the Ferrari
More raw than Big Daddy Kane spitting with Marley
More white than them three bitches sniffing with Charlie
That's coke like a Boston George New Year's party
The motherfucking Svengali
Mob boss got body in the XL Denali with the Mossberg shotty
Got a full box of shells and a ransom note
That ain't gunpowder out on my dash (That's coke!)

I'm raw as sushi, Belushi's spirit probably is with me
I'm Rick James, bitch, ask Bobby or Whitney
In the hood where the maniacs will rob you to get me
Getting blown by Paris, Nicole, Lindsey, and Britney
You shitting me?

All in together now - That's coke
All in together now - That's coke
All in together now - That's coke
All in together now - That's coke
All in together now - That's coke
All in together now - That's coke
All in together now - That's coke
All in together now - That's coke
All in together now - That's coke
All in together now - That's coke
All in together now - That's coke
