Music is life... life, life, life...
Come again...

E-e-elliphant
Holla at me hater Imma holla back
See me cut a dread in a disco track
Beer's on ice, soon as I'm home
Roll up a shrink now my beer is cold
I put my headphone on
Man gon' plug in and soon Imma zone
Imma groovin
Gotta keep grooving gotta groove for life
Rhythm is me window it's me hope it's me life
I gotta stay true yo, visitors free
I better hold on now, this time is me
And my man Ras G
If he cook a rock serve a melody

Hey yo yo, gotta keep movin' and groovin'
For life, for life
Hey yo yo, this type of music keep me groovin'
For life, for life
Music is life

Another day another dollar said
Waking up waking out wanna fly away
Who are you baby I never saw you bro
You're like a brush in my eyes
N-n-now Ras
Good vibes the people them want
Play the music ah tell me of Jah
From Jamaica to Sweden to France
People all jump and prance
It's source of life
Take heed from the word of the wise
When I'm down and out and I need some strength
Music can keep me alive

Hey yo yo, gotta keep movin' and groovin'
For life, for life
Hey yo yo, this type of music keep me groovin'
For life, for life
Music is life

Feel no pain
Blood run through my veins
Feel so good in my neighborhood
Breathe in breathe out and feel the love G
You may be poor but music is free
A shitty day but then you press play
Music will take you away
Hey yo yo, gotta keep movin' and groovin'
For life, for life
Hey yo yo, this type of music keep me groovin'
For life, for life
Music is life
Hey yo yo, gotta keep movin' and groovin'
For life, for life
Hey yo yo, this type of music keep me groovin'
For life, for life

You gotta keep moving boy
You gotta keep moving girl
You gotta keep moving on
You gotta keep moving on
You gotta keep moving boy
You gotta keep moving girl
You gotta keep moving on
