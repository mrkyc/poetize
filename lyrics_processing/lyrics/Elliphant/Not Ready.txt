We broke this open we shared the blisset things
We saw too much now we see nothing
You filled me empty space I didn't know I had
Slipped in me like a key, lock me up
We should've stopped the time
All I have now is a picture in this smoky mind
We should've stopped the time
All I have now is a picture in me

I guess I'm not ready for reality
A young woman in a new world
I have a big responsibility
To live life wild and free like a bird

Now is the time to be dancing
I'm too young to hold on
Soon I'm too old to let go man
That's when I go down on love
Now is the time to be dancing
I'm too young to hold on
Soon I'm too old to let go man
That's when I go down on love
You might also like
Life turns so quick into shit that was up with you
I lost myself in this I'm sorry sorry
I need to ride alone
That's all I promise man don't worry worry

I guess I'm not ready for reality
A young woman in a new world
I have a big responsibility
To live life wild and free like a bird

Now is the time to be dancing
I'm too young to hold on
Soon I'm too old to let go man
That's when I go down on love
Now is the time to be dancing
I'm too young to hold on
Soon I'm too old to let go man
That's when I go down on love
And I always pay for my shit

Now is the time to be dancing
I'm too young to hold on
Soon I'm too old to let go man
That's when I go down on love
Now is the time to be dancing
I'm too young to hold on
Soon I'm too old to let go man
