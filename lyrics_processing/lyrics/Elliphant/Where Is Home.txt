When the way come you know we can't stay
And then blissness is calling out for me
And your flesh is pink and life is color blue

I'm not here, And I never die
We got love, we can still survive
And what I feel's what I gotta do
But can I rest with you?

Where is home?
I'm starting to believe that it is gone
Cause I don't find it
Though I'm looking
Keep searching
Where is home?
All I want is silence in my soul
But I don't find it
Though I'm looking
Keep searching

Yeah, I'll be searching, searching, searching
You might also like
Life is drifting so fast, I don't sleep
I'm afraid to miss a moment where I'm free
With you
We're both lost, and nothin' without crew

I can jump cause I know I land
All I need is to trust your hand
And like the wind I will blow away
Unless you make me stay

Where is home?
I'm starting to believe that it is gone
Cause I don't find it
Though I'm looking
Keep searching
Where is home?
All I want is silence in my soul
But I don't find it
Though I'm looking
Keep searching

Yeah, I'll be searching, searching, searching
And I'm bursting, bursting, bursting
My mind is rumbling, rumbling, rumbling
Cause I'll be wondering, wondering, wondering
Where is home?
I'm starting to believe that it is gone
Cause I don't find it
Though I'm looking
Keep searching
Where is home?
All I want is silence in my soul
But I don't find it
Though I'm looking
Keep searching

Where is home?
I'm starting to believe that it is gone
Cause I don't find it
Though I'm looking
Keep searching
I need peace
All I want is silence in my soul
But I don't find it
Though I'm looking
Keep searching
