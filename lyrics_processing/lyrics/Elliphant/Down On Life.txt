We are waking up in a pile of shit
The whole bay is full of it
And it keeps growing out of our ears
But we keep swimming in this wide oceans of salty tears

I could use a break, me need to go
Down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight
I could use a break, me need to go
Down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight

Down the central of your sensual sense (Sensual sense)
Freak more freaks now while I got the chance
But keeps on cool, dogs, don't waste it all
The day is soon to come when you gon'
Need it, y'all, I say

I could use a break, me need to go
Down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight
I could use a break (Could use a break), me need to go (Me need to go)
Down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight
You might also like
Like leaves, the days are falling, not tell me why
The breeze carry for a while, but it will fall to the ground
These days life is a callin'
Life not a waiting, life is running away
But long after you're gone, your tears will still be answered
If you're here now, you'll be god forever

I could use a break (Could use a break), me need to go (Me need to go)
Down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take (Need you to take) all my shadows (All my shadows) for a walk tonight
I could use a break (Could use a break), me need to go (Me need to go)
Down, down, down, down on life
