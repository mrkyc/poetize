One day you will wake up and see
There's a light inside
Shining right through me
Sometimes we all just have to be
Like a steady ship
On a raging sea

But I'm never lonely
Can feel all the power running through me
Yeah I will keep rising, rising
Never giving in

I remember to the end, to the end, to the end
I remember, to the end
I remember fight again, fight again, fight again
I remember, fight again
Yeah I will fight again
They will strike again
I will fight again
Yeah I will fight again
I remember to the end, to the end, to the end
I remember, to the end
You might also like
My shoulders carry heavy load
While I'm on my way
To that great unknown
Right now tomorrow never known
But I live today, I just go go go

But I'm never lonely
Can feel all the power running through me
Yeah I will keep rising, rising
Never giving in

I remember to the end, to the end, to the end
I remember, to the end
I remember fight again, fight again, fight again
I remember, fight again
Yeah I will fight again
They will strike again
I will fight again
Yeah I will fight again
I remember to the end, to the end, to the end
I remember, to the end

Hey hey
I be like vroom vroom crash boom pow
Number one in the race of life yeah
We about that one in a billion
Fight for what then, fight for your reason
Who you want to be, your decision
Swim to shore hold on to a vision and
Take my hand l can loan the line
Said the dark is 'bout to be yourself again yeah
She said pow pow pow
Blau blau blau
I remember to the end, to the end, to the end
I remember, to the end
I remember fight again, fight again, fight again
I remember, fight again

They will strike again
