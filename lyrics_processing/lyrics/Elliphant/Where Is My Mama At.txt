Where is my mama at

Don't forget, how easy you forget
I'm a collector at a hard breaking sweat
I know my body breaking sweat trust me gimme zone 
That fucking bitch what you think I made of
I try to live in another one's kept me working 
'Bout to bossy good, was it good for me
I lost I lost cause what (what?)
That fucking sweaty body is what I made of

More people I know they friend them again
This me chosen family and see me sweat, see me pisses
Me a looking for a man na outer na space
But I shut down this place, come my base
You hit the center, we hit the moon
You hit the rest of we hit the groove
You hit the service, we hit the food
We in the front now we could take you
