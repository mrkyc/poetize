While your skin go wrinkle we only getting younger
We ride into a peek we can't take this shit no longer
Main our mind a lover man a body go weak
I got my bloody truth I got my BAS crew with me (me)
Walk around with bloody hands I saw you lick it off (off)
We gon' keep it dirty just to prove a point (point)
Keep it dirty is for truth that my crew hung up
Whoa
So fuck tomorrow we only getting younger

All universe implode in me
Up or down in and out no matter G
Now stop falling, I smell like a fox
Coloring questioning a blank answer box
Trip on trigger true, twist a tune, trick a dumb
Fresh like a fungus, smelling shit, smelling numb
We born together together we keep stronger
So fuck tomorrow we only getting younger

Fuck tomorrow we only getting younger
You to follow we are here to rumble
Grab a hand take things too long
Drag shit to its fullest blow me right from wrong
Stand tall, free I fall, your call, is my ball
Now yours, close them doors, get blown, by a force
Of truth, missing youth, fuck the shows, Skrillex
Haha, loose the goose man
(Fuck it)

Main our mind a lover man a body go weak
I got my bloody truth I got my BAS crew with me
I got my
I got my

Me and my bitches me and my dogs
Dandelion war keep digging streets for gold
Feeling kind of tense I need a cup of whiskey
My glass is overfull be careful when you pass me
We dominate this corner with my BAS family
Overtake this blocker with my boom energy
Born to be a rocker gotta grow with us
Acting like a sucka, suck it up, suck it all, What

Walk around with bloody hands I saw you lick it off
We gon' keep them dirty just to prove a point
Main our mind a lover man a body go weak
I got my bloody truth I got my BAS crew with me
I got my
I got my
