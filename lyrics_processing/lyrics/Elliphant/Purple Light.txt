Reachin' up for the glass, come on, nah, fill it up
Been empty for some time, come on, fill me up
Crack me up and rub a boob, nah, let it up
Burnin' (Burnin', burnin', burnin'), purple fire
Come on, nah, answer right, stay in this for a while
Suck a fingertip, shut up, nah, don't be shy (Shy, shy, shy)
Got a ciggy for a pretty smile (Come on), I'm cool, you purple fire

(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Ready for the purple light
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) Walk me through the purple light
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Need you here to take me
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) You ready, nah, ready, nah?

Let's unite, in a beat, yo, what's up? Let me be
One beautiful regret, I'm fallin' free
Don't forget, there's a war
I let you win it 'cause I won before
I am strung, you are drunk, I need water, get me some
Get your shit, let's get out, need to strike before we cool off
I am here, you are young
And for the night we go unite as one
You might also like
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Ready for the purple light
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) Walk me through the purple light
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Need you here to take me
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) You ready, nah, ready, nah?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Lemme in the purple light
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) I wanna be in purple light
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Young star, will you take me?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) You ready, nah, ready, nah?

Yuh, don't make me count to six, give you kitten's timeouts and shit
Keep your weapon and mouth your bitch, mine's pouring and my mouth is sick
Tell me "Doja, that hurts no fair", see my team, we just circle squares
Bad bitches with purple hair, with attitudes that no man could bear
Uh, oh, look at what the Cat dragged in, keep the rats out my cat mansion
Fuck all your opinions, I don't give them atten-ti-on
Can't you see it's a perfect night? Spin yourself and them girls gon' bite
Passing 'round in a circle higher, burn that fire that purple light

(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Ready for the purple light
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) Walk me through the purple light
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Need you here to take me
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) You ready, nah, ready, nah?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Lemme in the purple light
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) I wanna be in purple light
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Young star, will you take me?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) You ready, nah, ready, nah?
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Blew this purple fire, blew this purple smoke)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (Got some donuts, eat purple drugs)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Make a purple juice now)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (I stop to pray for you now)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (See, this is the road)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (In the sun put on)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Like I said man, take my hand)
