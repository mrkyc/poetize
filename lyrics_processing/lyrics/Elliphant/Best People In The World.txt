Rider
When I walk with you I'm stronger than before
Did not like you from the start, that's why I love you not 
We ah dun goh do dis, dance to judgement days
No worries, see me sitting by your side always
Hate with my love, man see I right through
Get another dutchie and I'm gonna tell you
A secret, it's not a secret no more
Together we make superpower super force

You're my brother, you're my friend
And Imma ride, Imma ride, here to the end
You're my brother, you're my friend
And Imma ride, Imma ride, here for you

The best people in the world
We are the best people in the world

We are the best people in the world

We are the best people in the world
The best people in the world
We are the best people in the world

Is it mad to think of us as some somethin' else?
Than a cracking cooliya, think of me when moon come shine
Show the world we're still around, calming looking well (looking well)
We looking like two fucking fools
Laugh with us now, if you get this joke
We are here for you to look like good and decent folks
Two bastards, two dusty diamonds
Take you to a new level while I wait for heaven

You're my brother, you're my friend
And Imma ride, Imma ride, here to the end

And Imma ride, Imma ride, here for you
