Yeah, yeah
Yeah, okay (Huh)
Okay, okay, okay

Comin' up in the hood where the streets are cold
Either you gon' stretch or either you gon' fold
Either you gon' ride or get rolled on
Which one is it or they pay you a visit
Comin' up in the hood where the streets are cold
Either you gon' stretch or either you gon' fold
Either you gon' ride or get rolled on
Which one is it or they pay you a visit (What you gon' do?)

You gon' ride? You gon' roll? You gon' stretch? You gon' fold?
You gon' keep your family poor?
Comin' up in the hood, watchin' my homies take the pressure
That's why I chose to be a mic-checker (What you gon' do?)
You gon' ball? You gon' fall? Let 'em knock you into walls?
Leave you dead in a hall?
Or you gon' keep hangin' in the streets with your crew
Don't ask me 'cause I know what I'ma do, but (What you gon' do?)
Ridin' stolos with dodo's and no go's
And fo'-fo's in choke holds after gettin' chased by the po-po's
You gon' ride solo or is you gon' groupie
Or is you gon' think before you start bein' stupid
You might also like
Comin' up in the hood where the streets are cold
Either you gon' stretch or either you gon' fold
Either you gon' ride or get rolled on
Which one is it or they pay you a visit
Comin' up in the hood where the streets are cold
Either you gon' stretch or either you gon' fold
Either you gon' ride or get rolled on
Which one is it or they pay you a visit (Now what you gon' do?)

You gon' rob? You gon' kill? Buy the drugs that you gon' deal?
Or go out and chase a mil'?
Or on the other hand get a deal like me
And go and write forty-eight bars to a beat, tell me (What you gon' do?)
Be another family failure, disrespectin' all your elders
Poor and livin' in a shelter
Or you gon' get killed, put in jail or be a doctor
And own a big house, on the roof a helicopter (What you gon' do?)
Stay in the same city, same hood, same block
Same homies changin' clothes and wearin' each others socks
Or do you wanna go somewhere, a life to try to live
And see about a hunnid, makin' money, taking trips

Comin' up in the hood where the streets are cold
Either you gon' stretch or either you gon' fold
Either you gon' ride or get rolled on
Which one is it or they pay you a visit
Comin' up in the hood where the streets are cold
Either you gon' stretch or either you gon' fold
Either you gon' ride or get rolled on
Which one is it or they pay you a visit (What you gon' do?)
Be a fan, be a star, do the dance, spit a bar
Be a fake snake or shark
Or go and shop and stuff, hit the mall, pop tags
Start stuff, get me red, white and blue like the flag (Jibbs, what you gon' do?)
Gettin' money, stay off the streets, they frontin', ain't funny
I ain't runnin', hoppin' from place to place like a bunny
Kinda sunny, phone on my waist vibrate 'cause it's comin'
Stay in shape, last in the game, this music business funny
For the sake that my hood cats hungry
Tryna get a mil' deal, bread and bologna
For the sake that my hood cats hungry
Tryna get a mil' deal, bread and bologna
