Yeah
Okay, what's up, y'all?
This is one of those dancin' songs

We ride big, big cars on them big, big rims
And we rock big clothes with them big, big Timbs
Got big cribs 'cause we got big grip
I'm a real big kid, 'cause we do it real big (Yeah)

Flow so hot, VVS diamonds in my big, big block
You know I got it on lock
Keep a chick on my arm more than a watch
She start lookin' at my finger, mane, because of the rock
And now the G's on the block shocked like the watch
It's like a car show when I open up my garage
Vipers, Maseratis, Lamborghini drop-tops
Cutty, cutty hydraulics once we drop it like it's hot
It's all or take, matter fact ya all all are fake
So therefore I'ma your head alternate
'Cause while you stabbin', I'm jabbin', you get to rappin' and actin'
And try to make it a habit, but Trix ain't for silly rabbits
Flawless style that make you shake
Girls cry me a river like Timberlake
That's like music that's trapped in, a stereo wrapped in
A gift that you wrapped and so you ain't hearin' jack then
You might also like
We ride big, big cars on them big, big rims
And we rock big clothes with them big, big Timbs
Got big cribs 'cause we got big grip
I'm a real big kid, 'cause we do it real big
We ride big, big cars on them big, big rims
And we rock big clothes with them big, big Timbs
Got big cribs 'cause we got big grip
I'm a real big kid, 'cause we do it real big (Oh, yeah)

Pull up in a whip, they want to see the T-I-P of my drip
Think I better get a grip
My money like the Olympics, I gotta make a flip
And never really kept fallin' but gotta take the trip
I'm livin' on Cribs while you dreamin' in your crib
So all you big babies could keep on your bibs
Stayin' on tour while my album gettin' shipped
Tryna get foreign picks: plane, bus, car, ship
So give it break, and still call Jibbs the great
You need to chill with ya grill sayin', "Jibbs a fake"
'Cause while you be grillin', your boy, Jibbs be chillin'
I'm tryna make me some millions put chandeliers in the ceilin'
Do it big, tryin to get mo' on my plate
While you're goin' half crazy, I put half on a lake
So sixteens I spend, for sixteen you get 'em
By sixteen, I'm livin' like sixteen with millions
We ride big, big cars on them big, big rims
And we rock big clothes with them big, big Timbs
Got big cribs 'cause we got big grip
I'm a real big kid, 'cause we do it real big
We ride big, big cars on them big, big rims
And we rock big clothes with them big, big Timbs
Got big cribs 'cause we got big grip
I'm a real big kid, 'cause we do it real big (Yeah)

Doin big thangs (Thangs), rock big clothes
With them big big chains (Chains) and we fly big planes (Planes)
'Copter so fly so we flyin' through the rain
Young Jibbs switchin' lanes while ya dudes bein' lame
So who you know that is hot and could flow like this (Nobody)
Ride in the back of the Range stay rove like this (Nobody)
Stay iced out let it show like this (Yeah)
I bet you ain't got a chorus that'll go like this (Yeah)

We ride big, big cars on them big, big rims
And we rock big clothes with them big, big Timbs
Got big cribs 'cause we got big grip
I'm a real big kid, 'cause we do it real big
We ride big, big cars on them big, big rims
And we rock big clothes with them big, big Timbs
Got big cribs 'cause we got big grip
