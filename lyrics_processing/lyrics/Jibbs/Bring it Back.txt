Gon' give it a test, 'cause you could do it the best
Just be like Mitchell & Ness and throw it back, girl
Get with it, have a ball and hit with it
Tryna get with the pitch just thought that I'd mention it
'Cause I been with it, in fact, I'ma throw a hit with it
Tried to blow my mind when she turned around and spinned with it

I'm 'bout to start off shoppin', you know them tags we poppin'
Only the freshest I'm rockin', I'm grabbin' new fits
It's kinda hard to fall, but it's so easy to ball
When I be hittin' the mall to grab a new chick
Steady goin', tell her 'bout the party I'm throwin'
I'm already knowin' that she feelin' the way that I'm flowin'
Take the girl from her, and I'm bringin' her out the Lou'
Lettin' her see the palm trees, showin' her how Cali do
From burnin' one to doin' the bounce then we hittin' the crunk
As soon as we open the doors, the party gon' jump
As soon as we turn up the music, the speakers gon' bump
And anybody sittin' down, we gon' tell 'em get up
Now I think it's just time for you to move
Just time for you to hit a home run like a bat, girl
I know you herd this before, but I'ma tell you some more
So listen carefully while I put it in fast forward
