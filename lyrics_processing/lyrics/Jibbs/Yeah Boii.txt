Hailin' from Southside St. Louis
The youngest phenomenal feat of all time
Jibbs

The cars is plush (Yeah, boy)
Ain't you that big head with that big boy truck? (Yeah, boy)
Ain't you that one with money stacked to the ceilin'? (Yeah, boy)
And it's a problem when the (Big kid Jibbs enter the buildin')

Yeah, I stay fresh, I stay flyer than the rest
'Cause when the kid didn't have much, the haters loved to talk mess
But better yet, I stay flyer than a plane, than a bird
Park my truck on 32's and got it lookin like it ain't a curb
I made my words, go back-a-wards to that limit
Then I got the girls, goin' crazy for the boy
'Cause I have no flurrs, and all the guys say I'm stingy
Because I cannot shurr, I run my city like Diddy
So you could call me Mur', real thing, you didn't see me comin
You could hear me 'fore you see me cause my Lamborghini hunmin'
Got the Hummer behind me and the beats just bumpin'
Bangin the concrete, it got'cha A-Town stompin'
Ayo I represent the South, S-T-L-O-U-I-S, man
Where they love to rock them fitted caps and them headbands
My Louis girls dressed in all white like it's a weddin'
And Pookie-Man standin' right by my side in black like he the best man

I got that S-550 wit that panoramic top
And my different color rims keep spinnin' when I stop
Yeah, the kid so flashy just to be my age
But girl don't mind me 'cause it's just my ways, yeah
What a wonderful day, I'm so icy
And all the other cats wanna be just like me
And that's for the fact that all the girls like me
Lil' mama, calm down 'cause you're gettin a lil' feisty
I got different color cars with my big, big bling
With reflections off the wall that make you think you're seein' things
And the trunk just thunderin', got everybody rumblin'
The truck sittin' so high that you could see up under it

Ain't you that big, big kid that all the girls lovin'? (Yeah, boy)
Was you for real when you say diamonds just a button and money ain't nothin'
Gettin' stacks by the dozen? (Yeah, boy)
Is it true you're murderin' tracks without cussin'? (Yeah, boy)
Everywhere the kid goin' it start ruckus (Yeah, boy)
I heard you somethin' like the kid Jay or Puffy, ridin' Phantoms is nothin'
Ain't that lifestyle lovely? (Yeah, boy)
Ain't it true that your chain do exotic things? (Yeah, boy)
Colorful diamonds and it flip four different ways? (Yeah, boy)
