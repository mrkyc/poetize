It was December in the Chi' when I saw you walkin' by
With the tears in your eyes and I walked up to your side (Oh yeah, oh)
So I asked you how you feel, "Girl, is everything alright?"
I want you to keep it real, girl, you ain't gotta lie
See that dude is a mark, a predator and a shark
And I knew that from the start, he wanted to break your heart
You ain't gotta think twice 'cause I ain't that type of guy
I'd rather see you happy, I don't wanna see you cry (Oh no)
Let's be real, come on now
Let's be for real (He can't love you like I do), he got no love (Let's be real)
Like I have for you, really feelin' bad for you

He doesn't love ya, bet I could treat you better
That's why I think, me and you should be together (Yes, baby)
He doesn't need ya (Uh-uh), bet I could please ya (Uh-huh)
He doesn't trust ya, forever tryna treat you (Yeah, ooh, girl)
He try to test ya, look at your texture
You should tell him, tell him that he really got you messed up
Tell him to beat it, me in your life you need it
I'm willin' to do whatever, you really can't beat it (Hold me, whatever you need, girl)
