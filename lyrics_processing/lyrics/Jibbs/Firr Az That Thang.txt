I'm the big, big kid, I'm doin' big, big thangs
It ain't what you call big headed, but I got a big brain
My lifestyle changed and when I got a little change
Not the attitude but gratitude to this game (A-let's go)
You ain't seen nothin' blingin' until you've seen my chain
'Cause the youngin' be ballin' harder than NBA
I get girls like Casper when I disappear my face
Everybody snappin' photos tryna get in my face
'Cause I'm sorta like a local, I'm on top of my game (Bring it)
And the way I spit and rep it's fire is a flame (Fire is a flame)
So you know I keep a chick that's fire as that thang (Fire as that thang)
I got a iced-out grill and a iced-out watch
With them Nike checks all on my shoes and socks
And my ear is like a alley 'cause it's full of rocks
I'm a key to the game, man, I got it on lock

Fire as that thang (You know I'm fire as that thang)
Fire as that thang (You know she fire as that thang)
Fire as that thang (What's that thang, what's that thang, boy?)
Fire as that thang (What's that thang, what's that thang, boy?)

See this my year, I'm 'bout to start a new thang
Fo' bottom white gold with the iced-out fangs
Make that Hemi holler, Charger almost sound like a train (Vroom)
Cruisin' to the hood on the highway and we switchin' lanes
I stay fresh, I stay fly in the best clothes (Fresh)
Rock the best bows, outfits get set low (No)
A funny guy, I'm all the girls' heartthrob
Smart, never rock a square's pants like SpongeBob
I'm sick with the flow, 'cause I'm the hottest
Get to my do' and I ain't speakin' when they knockin'
It's just about my time to shine so don't put your eyes
Where that time is, cause my shine'll blind (So hot, Young Jibbs)
I got everybody movin' this year
'Cause I own two planets, the sun and moon in my ear (Space)
Half yellow, half white, and it ain't no game
It's because your boy Jibbs is
