Yes nyah!
Cool nuh, Iyah
Hahaha
Who am I?
It's the girls dem sugar
Alright
Hear yah nuh

Sim-simma, who got the keys to my Bimmer?
Who am I, the girls dem sugar
How can I, make love to a fellow?
In a rush, pass mi the keys to my truck
Who am I, the girls dem luck
And I and I will make love to precious

You ever buck a gal weh deep like a bucket?
Draw fi your needle, and your needle can't stitch it
Draw fi your axe, and like a bough, you all a chop it
Draw fi your pick axe, and like a ground, you all a dig it
It's like a riverside, upon di banking you take it
It's like a bicycle, so you hold it, and dash it
Now you wash it, so you crash it, she a tell you say, "Your crabbit!"
Gyal, she a beg you and a bawl say fi, "stop it"
Badman plug in and mi a move off a electric
It's like a basketball, she take time-out fi vomit
Unuh listen to mi style, and unuh fi listen to mi lyrics
A Beenie Man deh yah, me a drop it (a say!)

But anything she wants, I will give it unto she
I can't believe the day my friend dem tell me that she flee
I don't believe it's angry, and I don't believe it's grief
I don't believe it's Susan, or the other girls I breed
The love for me she have, that is the only thing I need
I don't think den right now, just to lose my main squeeze
Oh Guantanamera, you a killer!
Gyal, the way you hot, you have mi body under pressure
Man see your body, all a kill mosquito
Woman your body right, just fi know you got di power
But..

I tell myself I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my guiding star, my shining light, I love you baby
But that day you leave and gone
I know that girls they're going crazy

No paper an a girl just watch
Yah a want unuh hear yah an listen weh di DJ seh
