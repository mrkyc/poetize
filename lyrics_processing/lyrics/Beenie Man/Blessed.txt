Blessed!
Preacher a query of what I am
Blessed be unto Thee, the holy trinity forever, King of kings and Lord of lords, conquering lion of the tribe of Judah
Blessed, seen
I sing

Who seek knowledge, get dem wisdom increase
Me no believe inna the devil or the mark of the beast
I rather dead, before me put the triple six inna mi head
I sing, I sing
Love Jah and live, or hate him and die
They teach us 'bout the Pope and not Selassie I
And we all know the whole of dem a Popus pie
That's why Beenie Man sing say...

Blessed be thy name
For certain wrongs I've done, who is to take the blame?
It's a shame
Blessed be thy name
I see Babylon a work, and dem a work in vain

I ask!
Who inoculate the ghetto youth dem brain?
Introduce the youth dem to the crack and cocaine?
Man a push needle inna dem main vein
Who make the backdoor deal down the lane?
Fi the big MAC-11, dem fly down pon plane
Presidents and prime ministers, none you can blame
Two of dem a play inna a rich man's game
Man blow the whistle, dem haffi find another lane
Babylon carry we come a Yaad under chains
Rape all the women, send the man fi chop canes
Dem always say we're mad when we shout Selassie's name
"Immanuel!" People say we're insane
Give dem a praise waan we do the same
Babylon release the chain and dem a use dem brain

So, blessed be thy name
For certain wrongs I've done, who is to take the blame?
It's a shame
Blessed be thy name
I see Babylon a work, and dem a work in vain

Hear this!
Inna Jam Down it's the land of profit
So why Pope Paul a get the benefit?
Why him never come yah when Gilbert deh yah?
Why him pick fi come when Beenie Man get hotter
True him know say me clever, have the world a shiver
Lace up mi shoes and all a buckle up mi collar
Nelson Mandela is a burning desire
Burning from when, from some great ancestors
Who deh pon the mic? Nuh Beenie man, the mobster
Oh God, He is my father

So, blessed be thy name
For certain wrongs I've done, who is to take the blame?
It's a shame
Blessed be thy name
I see Babylon a work, and dem a work in vain
Preacher man, life after death, don't bring that to I
'Bout, "Your body can dead and your spirit cannot die"
Through years of growing up dem a teach man pure lies
And teach we 'bout Combusus and not Selassie I
How Selassie blossomed, that's why the man died
Wha' me hear through the world, water fall from mi eyes
Fi see the world a bow down in front this white guy
With tall silky hair and this big blue eyes
'Bout, him a the son of the Almighty High
A Jah one me fear, and no other guy
Selassie I ever living and can't die

So, blessed be thy name
For certain wrongs I've done, who is to take the blame?
It's a shame
Blessed be thy name
I see Babylon a work, and dem a work in vain
From top!

Who seek knowledge, get dem wisdom increase
Me no believe inna the devil or no mark of the beast
I rather dead, before me put the triple six inna mi head
I sing, I sing
Love Jah and live, or hate him and die
They teach us 'bout the Pope and not Selassie I
And we all know the whole of dem a Popus pie
That's why Beenie Man sing again...
Blessed be thy name
For certain wrongs I've done, who is to take the blame?
It's a shame
Blessed be thy name
I see Babylon a work, and dem a work in vain

Beenie ask!
