Bwoy mi can tell a man somethin (Zo!)
A wait a man this, wait fi miss right (Zagga!)
But yuh nah go know who? Cau yuh seh nuh woman leave yuh
And this yuh realize too much woman outta road waan yuh (True word yute)
So soon yuh realize seh, day di whole a body deh a rome
All dat girl dem waan yuh
Well mi just put my hand pon my heart
And pick up my bible and sing a ting like this (Anyway)

Until di day I die more gal I waan my name mi hear di gal dem a chant
Inna di gal dem garden this hot tree haffi plant
And a drop soap caan stan a chance
Gal well black, gal well white, gal well slim
Gal well loose and gal well tight and gal we hype, and dem we like
We a di gyal dem paradise

Anyway!
Woman a send mi email from Iraq and Palestine
Seh right thru di air dem waan mi be dem valentine
See a mi dem waan and not Desmond Balentine
Lovin dem request but mek sure mi reach yours in time
Woman seh dem friend dem waan fi sample mi waistline
So mi punch in di treble, fling in di bassline
Girl line up pon mi door four six seven eight nine
See a mi dem waan fi wuk and dem nuh come fi waste time
