When slavery demolish 400 years ago
25 years ago an' it over it still going on

Emancipate yourself from mental slavery (Freedom Man)
None but ourselves can free our minds (Children of Soweto)
Have no fear for atomic energy (Somalia)
'Cause none of them can stop a' the time (How can it be the only refugees in di world)
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look? Ooh (Africa, it's for Africans)
Some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill Jah Book (Rasta say)

Do you know tell me what you really know
'Bout that great man Steve Biko
Do you know tell me what you really know
Of that great man, oh naw

I say seeing is believing but knowin' is best
I know he never deal with Rastafari concept
But I know he was a man of black people interest
So I say, black I am, my people must be strong
He gave me the confidence to sing this song
I hear they speak of Martin Luther
But as him get that dream dem shoot him after
I know, Steve Biko was a freedom fighter
A well educated South African lawyer
And one more
He was a hope for the people of Africa
'Cause in those time dey capture Mandela
Mount I

Oppression, suppression, depression cause debt
Dem take what dem want an' give man what left
Equal right and justice 
Di children of Soweto were gettin' upset
They were fighting for freedom and getting restless
Instead of freedom they got instant death

Like just, take over the street
Naked children, your glutchings too deep
Mother and father can't make two ends meet
Nuh turn way yuh face
'Cause I know yuh see it and I say

Do you know tell me what you really know
About that great man from Soweto
Do you know tell me what you really know

I know we don't rise and fall
He stand tall and tear down Babylon wall
He fought for freedom for Mandela
And people cry, and people cry eh yeah
He was a defender for all African slave
They gon' to jail and beat him and put him inna grave
They were so afraid of Steve Biko
He was so strong, he was too strong
He was a threat for Babylon
So I say eh eh

About that great man from Soweto

Emancipate yourself from mental slavery
