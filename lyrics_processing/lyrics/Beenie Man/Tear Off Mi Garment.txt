Well then!

Pick up mi pen, and mi a go write few letters
Invite some girl fi come down inna Jamaica
So, mi a go check and stand 'round di corner
The first foot mi put pon mi veranda

Gyal a tear off mi garments
And a bawl fi come inna mi apartment, woii
The gyal dem want the length and strength
Action speak louder than argument, well
Dem a tear off mi garment
And a bawl fi come inna mi apartment, woii
The gyal dem give me nuff compliment
Action speak louder than argument

Well!

Performance up to standards, 100 percent
And no "if" nor "suppose", you haffi well confident
She will torture your emotional experience
Remember that I am the doctor, treat all mi patients
And the gyal dem all a tell me, me a, "real statement"
True mi caress her down and make her body get tense
Well!
Mi nah go keep her inna no more suspense
