Reliving the past?
You lost! (Blessed, blessed)
You better walk on the right path
Big life! Livety!
Straight up
Mankind, unuh sing
Song!

Memories don't leave like people do
They always 'memba you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have
The Beenie Man a sing say, "Hey!"
Boy, stop live down inna di past
Stop from 'memba when man a ride horse
Now your dead, that means yuh soul lost
Crushed like a serpent snake under grass (Again!)
Boy, stop live down inna di past
Stop from 'memba when man a ride horse
Body between di board, your head a peep through the glass
Crushed like a serpent snake under grass

Meg, peg, diss a man yuh dead
Way back inna di west before dem lick D'Jango's head
"For a few more dollars"
'Nother one dead
High plains drifter man ah fled (I sing)
Too much wickedness
Down inna di west
Down inna di west
Wild Apache form
Dem nest
Dem nest
Outlaw Josey Wales
Get vexed (Get vexed)
All bounty hunter
Dem draw fi
Dem vest (Dem vest)
Gold an diamond
Wicked man intercept (Intercept)
Pack up mi saddle
And decide to make a flex
Way back inna di future
Where me haffi make a step (And sing along)
