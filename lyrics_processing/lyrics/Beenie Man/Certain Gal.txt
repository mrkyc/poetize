Ah, ah-ah-ah
Well, this is none other than
The mighty hit bouncer
Dedicated to all the girls who can't find a husband
Gyal

If a gyal a smell har arm
True she find out say nothing nah gwan
She a blow like a nowadays storm
But, tell her fi cool and calm
I sing
Sing along

Certain gyal a gwan nice, but she low
Me and mi friend dem done flop di show
(She get used like an old underwear)
(Now she a big, big, big poppy show)
That you fi know
Certain gyal a gwan nice, but she low
Me and mi friend dem done flop di show
(She get used like an old underwear)
(Now she a big, big, big poppy show)

She did a program the I from far
True she see me inna mi runaway car
But true mi hear how she stand
Mi just take a one slam
And nuh go back go check her

All a talk like she waan draw card
My girl just stay home, and hang up har phone
And mek she feel like dog
So

Certain gyal a gwan nice, but she low
Me and mi friend dem done flop di show
(She get used like an old underwear)
(Now she a big, big, big poppy show)
That you fi know
Certain gyal a gwan nice, but she low

Anytime she call you, tell her you nuh inna her
Laugh up, and a push up under we, the big stars
All a gwanie-gwanie, like a wi and her a par
Tell her fi stop before it reach too far
'Cause matey is a ting weh you nuh keep, no way
You a goody-goody, anytime of the day
Furthermore, you not even sure if she gay
'Cause she nuh stop flex, like sex a runaway
So, if a gyal a smell her arm
True she find out say nothing nah gwan
She a blow like a nowadays storm
But, tell her fi cool and keep calm
