Man fi have nuff gyal

The one burner business nah work again
Cah one man fi have all fifty gyalfriend
Yuh stop drink Roots, start drink it again
You haffi have the stamina fi service dem
When mi talk 'bout nuff gyal, just understand weh mi mean
Suppose yuh want fi line up all a netball team
One gyal can't make the team, neither
Two gyal can't fulfill mi dream
So mi haffi mek a walk over Portmore scheme
Gyal a gimme money, gyal a keep mi clothes clean
Gyal fi cook, gyal fi press, gyal a stitch mi gabardine
