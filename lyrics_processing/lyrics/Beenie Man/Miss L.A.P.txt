So mi go so
Miss World, mi a eyes you for a long time
It seems like everywhere you go that's where the sun shine
I wanna penetrate your mind with some strong rhyme
And entertain your thoughts with the right line
Baby cut the crap, I wanna make you mine
I can't take a nap until the deal is signed
Me want your body but it's like a new design

But that a when months upon months of searching
Still can't find the right blend
