Show me your unfailing love
There is no other
Have mercy on your wayward son
From grace I fell
Opened up my eyes in hell
Brimstone burning, I'm crying out in agony
Father, send someone
Quench the fire from my tongue
Where the worm's eternal and I'm crying out in agony, yeah
Sunburns out and it fades to black
There's no way I'm gonna make it back
Out of time and I'm running out of light
(X out, X out) Faith
(X out, X out) Hope
(X out, X out, X out) Love
(X out, X out) Faith
(X out, X out) Hope
(X out, X out, X out) Love
Behold a flower
Flourishing, then falls away
Know not the hour
Number of, or length of days
You might also likeSave your breath
On a stage a strutter frets
Just another tale being told by an idiot
Vanity
Full of sound and fury
Whistling past your weathered epitaph
I'm never coming back
I'm never coming back
Sunburns out and it fades to black
There's no way I'm gonna make it back
Out of time and I'm running out of light
(X out, X out) Faith
(X out, X out) Hope
(X out, X out, X out) Love
(X out, X out) Faith
(X out, X out) Hope
(X out, X out, X out) Love
(X out, X out) Faith
(X out, X out) Hope
(X out, X out, X out) Love
(X out, X out) Faith
(X out, X out) Hope
(X out, X out, X out) Love
Rich man blessed in purple thread
Poor man begging for a crust of bread
Like the poor the rich are born to die
One man suffering forever damned
The other in the bosom of Abraham
Looking on beyond the great divide
Darkness drapes both sun and moon
After the rain, storm clouds return
Strong men bow and the housekeeper's quake
Severed is the silver chord
Broken like the golden gourd
Dust returns to death from whence it came
Love
(X out, X out) Faith
(X out, X out) Hope
(X out, X out, X out) Love
(X out, X out) Faith
(X out, X out) Hope
