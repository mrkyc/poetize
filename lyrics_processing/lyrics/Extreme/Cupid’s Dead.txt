I read the news today oh boy
About a tragic comedy
Newspaper hinted suicide
The letterhead read dear Johnny
The tainted truth was all it said
Sleep tight now that you've made your bed
An arrow that once pierced my heart
Points to the apple on your head
Three sides to
Every story
Yours, mine and Monday morning's
Cupid's dead, headlines read
Cupid's dead, oh no no
Cupid's dead, headlines read
Cupid's dead, oh no no
Papers here! Get your papers here! Extra! Cupid's dead!
Oh, Romeo, oh, Romeo
Where did our love go, Romeo?
If you read between the headlines
You wouldn't be the last to know
No mystery yet to unfold
A paperboy left in the cold
A love was said to never die
Withered away and just got old

Yours, mine and Monday morning's
Cupid's dead, headlines read
Cupid's dead, oh no no
Cupid's dead, headlines read
Cupid's dead, oh no no no no
Our top story tonight, is a crime of passion
The victim, an unidentified man
Is found in bed, wearing only a diaper
Holding a bow an arrow in one hand
And clutching a letter in the other
The letter simply read, Cupid's dead

Cupid is dead, deceased, I got peace of mind
Still it's hard to forget, what it leaves behind
A lot of love lost, your feelings are wasted
Tasted the sweetness, but now you're faced with
The thought, of being alone, no more companionship
You can handle it, just abandon it
Leave it behind, and look for the brighter day
Give it some time, 'cause it won't come right away}
You gotta be standing strong, hold on to your dignity
Don't sit around, saying look what ya did to me
It's time to move on, you gotta continue
To look for a love, of a life that's within you
Cupid is dead now, it's time to rely on, yourself to cope
You got no shoulder to cry on dead
