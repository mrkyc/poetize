Look around, look around, look around you
Little town, lost and found where we find you
If you stay, your decay will define you, oh
Come along, come along, come and join us
Take a little walk in the middle of the madness
Get your mind and your rhyme and your reason blown

You can feel it, can you taste it?
Take a bite of your life, don't you waste it
Ride the lightning, roll the thunder
You're the chosen one

I'm gonna lift you up, up, up, up
Straight to the top
I'm gonna raise you up, up, up, up
Then rip you apart
I'm gonna lift you up, up, up, up
Watch you rise, watch you fall
Gonna raise you up, up, up, up
Rise
Up, up, up, up
Rise

Take a bow, take a bow to the new king
Ever cool is the fool never lasting
Wanted dead or alive, every king must die
Tick tock, tick tock, you're a time bomb
World is gonna watch while you have your final meltdown
What you were, what you want, what you are no more

They can feel it, they can taste it
Eat you up, spit you out, defecated
Boy wonder, trampled under
You're the chosen one

Gonna lift you up, up, up, up
Straight to the top
I'm gonna raise you up, up, up, up
Then rip you apart
I'm gonna lift you up, up, up, up
Watch you rise, watch you fall
Gonna raise you up, up, up, up
Up, up, up, up

Want it, got it
Bought it, sold it
Bag it, tag it
Take it, leave it

I'm gonna lift you up, up, up, up
Straight to the top
I'm gonna raise you up, up, up, up
Then rip you apart
I'm gonna lift you up, up, up, up
Watch you rise, watch you fall
Gonna raise you up, up, up, up
Rise
Up, up, up, up
Gonna lift you up, up, up, up
Straight to the top
Gonna lift you up, up, up, up
Then rip you apart
I'm gonna lift you up, up, up, up
Watch you rise, watch you fall
Gonna lift you up, up, up, up
Up, up, up, up

You got what you want
You got what you want, oh yeah
You got what you want
