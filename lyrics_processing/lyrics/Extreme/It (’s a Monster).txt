Everybody was born in it
Sure as hell gonna die in it
Some people don't give a shit
No, no, whether or not they're full of it

It's on my mind
Most of the time
That's when you find
We all go blind
Then it will start
To get in our hearts
It's gone too far
That's who we are

It's a monster
(We all have within us)
It's a monster
(It's a monster)
It's a, it's a monster
It's a monster
(Turns us into sinners)
It's a monster
(It's a monster)

Started when I played with it
It turned into a habit
And after that, once you've been bit
Oh, you can't seem to get rid of it

It's on my mind
(On my mind)
Most of the time
(Most of the time)
That's when I find
(When you find)
We all go blind
