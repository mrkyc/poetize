We're all the people we say we ain't
We're all winners and we're all cheats
We're all the things that we wanna defeat
We're all innocent and we're all pure
We're all diseased and we're all the cure
We're all living and we're already dead
We're everything that we need to pretend
Rip off your mask and show me who you are
Show me who you are, show me who you are
Rip off my mask, show you who I am
Show you who I am, show you who I am
Rip off your mask and show me who you are
Show me who you are, show me who you are
Rip off my mask, I'll show you who I am
Show you who I am, show you who I am
We're all secrets and we're all told
We're all the things that we wish to behold
We're all rich and we're all poor
We're all searching for what it's all for
We're all doubters and we're all faith
We're all the things that we want to replace
We're all fiction and we're all fact
We're all the good and we're all the bad

Show me who you are, show me who you are
Rip of your mask and show me who you are
Show me who you are, show me who you are
Rip off my mask, I'll show you who I am
Show you who I am, show you who I am
Rip off my mask, I'll show you who I am
Show you who I am, show you who I am
I'll take the blame for all my sins
But I won't take the hate for what you imagine
What you imagine
What you imagine, ooh
We're all innocent and we're all pure
We're all diseased and we're all the cure
We're all living but we're already dead
We're everything that we need to pretend
Show me who you are, show me who you are, show me who you are
Show me who you are, show me who you are
I need it all
Rip off my mask, I'll show you who I am
Show you who I am, show you who I am
I need it all
Rip off my mask, I'll show you who I am
