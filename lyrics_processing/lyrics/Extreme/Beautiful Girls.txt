There are so many beautiful girls, yeah
All around the world
There are so many beautiful, beautiful girls
Packed my bags hit the road, gonna search the world
On a mission I gotta find the perfect girl
Might end up in Rome
Or she could be in Tokyo
Touching down, hit the ground, gonna hit the beach
Surf and sand had no chance to really burn my feet
My goddess in the sun
Could she really be the one?
All around the world, all around the world
There are so many beautiful girls, yeah
All around the world, all around the world
There are so many beautiful, beautiful girls
Hey, hey, hey
California girls, I wish they all could be
Maybe New York City when she first kissed me
A million miles I'll run
Over the moon, under the sun

How do I know which one to make mine?
Small town beautiful butterfly
Couple girls out there will make a man cry
Porcelain, Nubian queens
And all the pretty pigments in-between
Kittens, cougars, southern belles
Femme fatales, you got the looks that kill
Beautiful girls rock my world
Shapes, sizes, drop dead curves
Brunettes, redheads, strawberry blondes
Know what I'd do if I had a magic wand
I'd wave it, have a wish come true
Wake up every day me next to you
You and I soaking up the sunshine
Baby, in no time, maybe you can be mine
