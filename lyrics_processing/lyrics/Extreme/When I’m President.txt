My dad said, "Son, what do you want to be?"
It didn't ring no bells, but I said
"Daddy, I'm a bit too young, what do you want from me?"
I'm much older now, I'm almost a man
I can do anything, you bet I can
Raise a family, now wouldn't that be grand
So sorry, but I got bigger plans
Yeah!
You can be anything in the world today
Something like a preacher, a teacher, a baseball player
Those kind of things I just don't care
