"I have a dream this afternoon
That the brotherhood of man
Will become a reality in this day
With this faith
I will go out and carve the tunnel of hope
Through the mountain of despair
With this faith
I will go up with you and
Transform dark yesterdays into bright tomorrows
With this faith
We will be able to achieve this new day
When all of the God's children
Black men and bright men
Jews and gentiles
Protestants and Catholics
Will be able to join hands
And sing with the Negroes
In the spiritual head
'Free at last, free at last
Thank God Almighty
We're free at last'"
