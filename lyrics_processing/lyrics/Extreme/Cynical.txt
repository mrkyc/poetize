Compared to tomorrow
If time is all we have
Then we're living on borrowed
Yesterday's for fools
Who try to, try to remember
Try to remember
The good ol' days
Weren't always that much better
'Coz I'm a cynical fuck
Well, I ain't nothing but a cynical fuck
It don't take much to be a cynical
All you need is love
All you need is what to be
A cynical fuck
Well, I ain't nothing but a cynical fuck
It don't take much to be a cynical
All you need is love
All you need is what?
And whatever you do
Someone's done it first
Though it's sad but true
This is just another verse
If you can't take it with you
Then what's the use?
What's the use, what's the use?
I never saw a U Haul
Being pulled behind a
Pulled behind a hearse
'Coz I'm a cynical fuck
Well, I ain't nothing but a cynical fuck
It don't take much to be a cynical
All you need is love
Yeah, all you need is what to be
A cynical fuck
Well, I ain't nothing but a cynical fuck
It don't take much to be a cynical
All you need is love
All you need is love
It looks like my brighter side
Has gotten a bit darker
I must have stepped over
My four leaf clover
'Coz someone drank my
Half-filled cup of water
Cynical fuck
Well, I ain't nothing but a cynical fuck
It don't take much to be a cynical
All you need is love
Yeah, all you need is love to be
A cynical fuck
Well, I ain't nothing but a cynical fuck
It don't take much to be a cynical
All you need is love
Cynical fuck, cynical fuck
All you need is love
Cynical fuck, cynical fuck
