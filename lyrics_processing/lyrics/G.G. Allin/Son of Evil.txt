My demons lay beside me as I kiss them one by one
Then on that day I met a force that nothing will compare
I was born the son of evil when I fucked the Devil there
My daddy was a powerful soul back in '56
My mother was a virgin when she first felt his prick
Then on August 29th, baby Jesus Christ was born
An alien to the world, he was set out to destroy
I'm the son of evil, the God of Fire in Hell
I'm the son of evil, the one you'll never know
As I look into your eyes, you'll only cry for help
I want to paralyze you 'cause I only love myself
But when I was reborn from the day I fucked the Devil
Nothing will come close to me because I am immortal
Many lives I've lived, and many times I've died
But my soul cannot be stopped, as it's on an endless ride
As I look into your eyes, you see an icy stare
I want to bring you to your knees, destroy your life right there
Put your hand in mine as I take you for a ride
You'll see your life be stripped away, 'cause today you're gonna die
I'm the son of evil, the God of Fire in Hell
I'm the son of evil, the one you'll never know
As I look into your eyes, you'll only cry for help
I want to paralyze you 'cause I only love myself
You might also likeLaying on the floor in a pool of blood and cum
My demons lay beside as I kiss them one by one
For on that night I met a force that nothing will compare
I was born the son of evil when I fucked the Devil there
My daddy was a powerful soul back in '56
My mother was a virgin when she first felt his prick
Then on August 29th, baby Jesus Christ was born
An alien to the world, he was set out to destroy
