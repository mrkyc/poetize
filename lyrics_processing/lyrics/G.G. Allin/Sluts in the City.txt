And we don't ever need anybody
We might stink, but we're strong
And we don't give a fuck about anyone
Oh sluts in the city, walk like me
Oh sluts in the city, talk like me
We're the sluts in the city, I'm a bitch I'm a sleazy whore
Well, uptown, downtown, all around
You see, on Cedar Street, where sluts and I will be
We're all out there, looking for a thrill
We got money, but we don't care
We get in trouble for the things we wear
We don't fit in, they're always closing doors
We get kicked around by everyone, outsiders looking in
We're the Cedar Street sluts, and we hate everyone
Oh sluts in the city, walk like me
Oh sluts in the city, talk like me
Oh sluts in the city, I'm a bitch and I'm a sleazy whore
Oh sluts in the city, walk like me
Oh sluts in the city, talk like me
Oh sluts in the city, I'm a bitch I'm a sleazy whore
You might also likeEast side, west side, suicide
I beat my dick for kicks, I wanna get so high
A cheap bottle of brandy, a joint, or a bottle of wine
Hey what's the matter? Well I'm fucking pissed
I'm all fucked up, but it's such a blast
Because I'm drunk in generation x
Got a barbed wire fence wrapped around my neck
Outsiders looking in, we're the sluts, and we hate everyone
Oh sluts in the city, walk like me
Oh sluts in the city, talk like me
Oh sluts in the city, I'm a bitch I'm a sleazy whore
Oh sluts in the city, walk like me
Oh sluts in the city, talk like me
Oh sluts in the city, I'm a bitch I'm a sleazy whore
Yea, we're gonna die young, 'cause we're tough
And we don't really need
We might stink, but we're strong enough
And we don't give a fuck about anyone
Oh sluts in the city, walk like me
Oh sluts in the city, talk like me
I'm a slut in the city, I'm a bitch I'm a sleazy whore
I'm an animal creeping in the night
A sick perverted thing in the sewer pipe
In the concrete jungle, when walls cave in
'Cause sluts in the city rule, OK, outsiders looking in
Well, we're the sluts, and we hate everyone
Oh sluts in the city, walk like me
Oh sluts in the city, talk like me
Oh sluts in the city, I'm a bitch I'm a sleazy whore
Oh sluts in the city, walk like me
Oh sluts in the city, talk like me
