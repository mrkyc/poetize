Scream and shout like a witch will do
Would you give a little bit, ahaha
Give a little bit of attention to me
If I dress on up in fancy clothes
With a come on smile in a real nice pose
Would you give a little bit, ahaha
Give a little bit of attention to me
Yeah, baby, baby
Mmm-mmm, I'm tired of getting it through to you
It ain't no good, 'cause I just can't do enough
I can't do enough
Mmm-mmm, I'm always here when you wanna play
But then you walk away when I need your love
I need your love
I don't wanna be a star attraction
Just need some action
So come on, baby, can't you see
All I'm asking for is a little attention to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
