Then just walk away
We don't have tomorrow
But we had yesterday
Wasn't it me who said that
Nothing good's gonna last forever?
And wasn't it me who said
Let's just be glad for the time together? (Together ooo)
Must have been hard to tell me
That you've given all you had to give
I can understand your feeling that way (Ooo)
Everybody's got their life to live
Well, I can say goodbye in the cold morning light (Ahh)
But I can't watch love die in the warmth of the night (Ahh)
If I'm gonna be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?
'Till you go I need to, lie here and think about (Ooo ahh)
The last time that you'll touch me in the morning
Then just close the door
Leave me as you found me, empty like before
Hey, wasn't it yesterday
We used to laugh at the wind behind us?
And didn't we run away and hope
That time wouldn't try to find us (Didn't we love)
Didn't we take each other
To a place where no-one's ever been?
Yeah, I really need you near me tonight (Ooo)
'Cause you'll never take me there again
Let me watch you go (Ahh)
With the sun in my eyes
We've seen how love can grow (Ahh)
Now we'll see how it dies
You might also likeOh, if I'm gonna be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?
'Till you go I need to (Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo)
Touch me in the morning (Morning's were good and gold and we could feel one another baby)
Then just walk away (We're left with a dream to hold and we could take what the world was giving)
We don't have tomorrow (There's no tomorrow here, there's only love and the time to chase it)
But we had yesterday (Yesterday's gone my love, there's only now and the time to face it)
Touch me in the morning (Morning's were good and gold and we could feel one another baby)
Then just walk away (We're left with a dream to hold and we could take what the world was giving)
We don't have tomorrow (There's no tomorrow here, there's only love and the time to chase it)
