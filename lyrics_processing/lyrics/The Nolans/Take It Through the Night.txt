And it looks like I'm having fun
Don't you worry, don't be sad now
Cause you know you're the only one
Who means this much to me
(Who means this much to me)
Who means this much to me
(Who means this much to me)
You see I'm waiting, for the moment
When you can be next to me
Why don't we take it through the night?
Make sure we got the feeling right
Then you can do the things you do
And see how love will follow through
Every moment, I'm without you
Seems like more than my heart can stand
But you're here now, and we're dancing
And I hope that you understand
How much you mean to me
(How much you mean to me)
How much you mean to me
(How much you mean to me)
You might also likeThere's a moment, so let's take it
And forget what the others say
Why don't we take it through the night?
Make sure we got the feeling right
Then you can do the things you do
And see how love will follow through
That smile, for me
Is all you need
I know, you're here
Now we're complete
Let's dance, let's move
It's getting late
Just think, what we could generate
If you
Hide behind a dream
You get hurt
Baby can't you see
Just what I mean
Why don't we
Why don't we take it through the night?
Make sure we got the feeling right
Then you can do the things you do
And see how love will follow through
Why don't we take it through the night?
Make sure we got the feeling right
Then you can do the things you do
And see how love will follow through
I wanna rock
I wanna groove
I wanna show you all the love, I have for you
I wanna rock
I wanna groove
I wanna show you all the love, I have for you
Why don't we take it through the night?
Make sure we got the feeling right
Then you can do the things you do
And see how love will follow through
Why don't we, take it through the night?
Make sure we got the feeling right
Then you can do the things you do
