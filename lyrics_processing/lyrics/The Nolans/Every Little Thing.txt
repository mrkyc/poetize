And my head ruled out my heart
I've wasted so much time
Now I'm planning to make a new start
But I fell in love, that's true (Fell in love with you)
Maybe that was my mistake
But I tried to fight the feelings
Feelings for you
Fight those feelings, for you
Because every little thing
That you do, that you say
Makes me love you
Oh, just a little more
Every day, anyway
And I know that it's right
So let it be, harmony I can see
Here by your side
If you answer to me (Answer to me)
I will answer to you
And we're living in the name of love
Living in the name of love
Living in the name of love
