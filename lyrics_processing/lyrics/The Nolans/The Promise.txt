Everything he does, better than anything ordinary
Everything he wants he gets
'Cause everything he does is kinda necessary
Well I believe in love
Tell me can anything last forever
If life can live up to love
Then a hand on my heart, I'm never saying never
You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all, nothing that I do
Promise I made, promise I made
Started to fade, started to fade (fade)
You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all that I cannot do
Promise I made, promise I made
Started to fade, started to fade
You might also like
Maybe next time I'll take a ride on by
I wanna feel you near
'Cause I can't play this like I'm meant to now
My Aladdin's lamp is down
And I got a fear
Oh baby right here

Giving up just looking into windows, yeah
And I've had enough of wishing I found you
Baby don't you know
I've had as much as I can take of falling
Got a lot to learn about riding through

You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all, nothing that I do
Promise I made, promise I made
Started to fade, started to fade (fade)
You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all that I cannot do
Promise I made, promise I made
Started to fade, started to fade
Here I am, walking Primrose
Wondering when I'm gonna see you again
So here I am, walking Primrose
Wondering when I'm gonna see you again

I got my hands all ready to touch your soul
I'm gonna get the energy to wire me close to you
Got my eyes on the prize I see
Are you watching me baby?
'Cause my heart is turning to solid gold
And my

Head is saying, "Honey, too good to be true."
But one look in your glittered eyes
Power's failing me every time

You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all, nothing that I do
Promise I made, promise I made
Started to fade, started to fade (fade)
You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all, that I cannot do
Promise I made, promise I made
Started to fade, started to fade

Maybe it's not that hard to know you
Maybe we'll make it up and go
Maybe we'll work things out
There's only one way up and one way down I know
If you wanna convince me start again
If you wanna be with me in my arms

You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all, nothing that I do
Promise I made, promise I made
Started to fade, started to fade (fade)
You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all, that I cannot do
Promise I made, promise I made
Started to fade, started to fade
You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all, nothing that I do
Promise I made, promise I made
Started to fade, started to fade (fade)
You're gonna make me, make me love you
Nothing at all, that I cannot do
Promise I made, promise I made
