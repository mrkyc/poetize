I can't see
I can't see

Got no scars cut on my skin, only my truth is wearing thin
And it hollows me, it hollows me
I hate the darkness of my past, the cold rebelling, it drives me mad
And it follows me, it's carving the heart out of me
I've gotta bleed it out, all my thought intoxicated
'Cause the weight on me, it buries me alive

It pulls me down right into the darkness
It pulls me down, and I can't resist

Let me feel it 'cause I don't know, I can't see
All I feel's I'm breaking up
Oh, can't you see it's taking over, over me?
Can't you see?
Yeah, you want me to fight it, and you want me to let go
Yeah, you tell me to fight it, and you damn me if I don't
So let me bleed it out and purge me, I can't see
No, I can't see, no, I can't see

My defiance made me strong, but now I'm doubting what I've done
And it's killing me, it's killing me
I hate to see what I've become, I find no peace, no justice done
This gravity, it's carving the heart out of me
I've gotta bleed it out, all my thoughts intoxicated
'Cause the weight on me, it buries me alive

It pulls me down right into the darkness
It pulls me down, and I can't resist

Let me feel it 'cause I don't know, I can't see
All I feel's I'm breaking up
Oh, can't you see it's taking over, over me?

Yeah, you tell me to fight it, and you damn me if I don't

No, I can't see, no, I can't see
'Cause I can't see
