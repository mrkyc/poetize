It burns into your heart the darkness that you fear
You were never free, and you never realized
And love is a word you've never heard
Your heart ain't cold 'cause it burns a desire to leave the mire

Take your breath till nothing's left
Scars of life upon your chest
And I know wherever it goes

And we run with a lonely heart
And we run for this killing love
And we run till the heavens above
Yeah, we run, running in the dark
And we run till we fall apart
And we run till the heavens above

Don't blink, you'll miss it, lift up your head
We gotta get gone, yeah, we outta here
Don't blink, you'll miss it, lift up your head
Too late, we're gone, yeah, we outta here
And we run with a lonely heart
And we run for this killing love
And we run for a heavenly heart

I'mma break these chains, ran through the rain
Never look back, never quit, work through the pain
This blood in my veins run cold when I think
It'll never be the same, but I never lose hope
This is my time now, no time for tears, celebrate
Put it in the air right now, never back down
You could never wear my crown 'cause it weigh too much
And I crush every motherfucking thing I touch
This is love, I've never loved so much
Get involved, make the world stand up
Give my life before I ever give up
"Name in lights", you lost all my trust
Now it's time to face all of us
Get in line 'cause they're calling us
And it feels so marvelous
Just take my hand and run

And we run with a lonely heart
And we run for this killing love
And we run till the heavens above
Yeah, we run, running in the dark
And we run till we fall apart
And we run till the heavens above
Don't blink, you'll miss it, lift up your head
We gotta get gone, yeah, we outta here
Don't blink, you'll miss it, lift up your head
Too late, we're gone, yeah, we outta here
And we run with a lonely heart
And we run for this killing love
And we run for a heavenly heart
Don't blink, you'll miss it, lift up your head
We gotta get gone, yeah, we outta here
Don't blink, you'll miss it, lift up your head
