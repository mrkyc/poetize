It's been a while since I told ya that I hate ya
You've turned the truth inside out
Don't turn your back when I face ya, or I'll make ya
You turned my world upside down

You got inside my head, I want you out
'Cause I've been betrayed on holy ground

Burying the truth with lies, fed up how you justify
And I hate it, and I hate it
You're so despicable when you're acting reasonable
And I hate it, and I hate it
Your words like firing guns, bullets raining
The way you hurt me 'cause you never wanna face it
Your words like firing guns, bullets raining
Bullets raining, you never wanna face it

What does it take now to break ya, to wake ya
To make you bow and spit it out?
Doesn't matter if I hate ya or embrace ya?
Nothing makes you turn around
