Now darkness has come to the roses
The fire is reaching the end
The colours that I have created
Are suddenly flying away
I'm not fighting myself, will not follow
'Cause my choices are mine, it's my fate
And I'll never bow down from the sorrow
I'll face all that is coming my way

Denying the devil of silence
Embracing the world on the edge

Let us burn, let us burn
And light up the skies here tonight
Let us burn, let us burn
In this fire that makes us yearn
Whoa, we're fighting our fear of the silence
We're running through walls where they stand
Let us burn, let us burn, let us burn

I'm searching no more for tomorrow
I reach for the skies while I can
The unknown will always be waiting
My last day, I'll jump in its hands
I'm not fighting myself, will not follow
'Cause my choices are mine, it's my fate
And I'll never bow down from the sorrow
I'll face all that is coming my way

Whoa, we're fighting our fear of the silence

Why, why don't you let me burn?
Why don't you count down and break out and let us burn?
Oh why, why don't you let me burn?
Why don't you let me burn?
Why don't you let me burn?
Oh why?
Erasing the demons in my mind
Oh why am I
Waiting for change, throwing me to the ground?
