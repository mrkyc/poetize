There's no sense, the fire burns
When wisdom fails, it changes all
The wheel embodies all that keeps on turning
Blood red skies, I feel so cold
No innocence, we play our roll
The wheel embodies all, where are we going?

All in all, you'd expect the wise to be wiser, fallen from grace and
All and all I guess we should've known better 'cause

What about us? Isn't it enough?
No, we're not in paradise
This is who we are, this is what we've got
No, it's not our paradise
But it's all we want, and it's all that we're fighting for
Though it's not paradise

You and us, or I and them
There comes a time to take a stand
The wheel is watching all, it keeps on burning
The venom works, it's like a curse
A Trojan horse, when will we learn?
The wheel embodies all that keeps returning
