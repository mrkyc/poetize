Beautify all I know, keep on dancing
Let it all turn to gold
When the dream touches ground, the demons walk in
And I know what awaits

A priceless glory
Memento mori
All for nothing now
I know

Nothing of the heart remains
Even if we could've stayed
We've been here long enough
Long enough to know it's all in vain
Everything we tried to say
Up until the final day
I guess we said enough
Said enough to know it's all in vain

All in vain
All in vain
All in vain
All in vain

See the world through a tear, keep on breathing
Salt has dried, you're not here
Just a heartbeat away, the demons walk in
Now I know it's too late

A priceless glory
Memento mori
All for nothing now
I know

Nothing of the heart remains
Even if we could've stayed
We've been here long enough
Long enough to know it's all in vain
Everything we tried to say
Up until the final day
I guess we said enough
Said enough to know it's all in vain

All in vain
All in vain
All in vain
All in vain
Took the memories, but I can feel them fading
All our vanities, there's nothing left to save me now
I can take 'em 'cross the border
I can take 'em 'cross the border
Leaving everything we have for you to find it
Every time I walk away, I wanna turn around
I wanna turn around

But nothing of the heart remains
Even if we could've stayed
We've been here long enough
Long enough to know it's all in vain
Everything we tried to say
Up until the final day
I guess we said enough
We said enough to know it's all in vain
I guess we said enough
We said enough to know it's all in vain

All in vain
All in vain
All in vain
