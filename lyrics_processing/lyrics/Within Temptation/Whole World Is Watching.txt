You live your life, you go day by day
Like nothing can go wrong
Then scars are made, they're changing the game
You learn to play it hard

And I know you wish for more
And I know you try
And now you realise
You know the time is right

The whole world is watching when you rise
The whole world is beating for you right now
Your whole life is flashing for your eyes
It's all in this moment that changes all
What are you waiting for? What are you fighting for?
'Cause time's always slipping away
The whole world is watching
Yeah, the whole world is watching you when you rise

You build your walls, then break them away
'Cause that is what it takes
You saved yourself, you found who you are
That never goes away

Your sacrifice goes through your mind
But nothing is wasted, you've made it now
You rise again, breaking out

The whole world is watching
