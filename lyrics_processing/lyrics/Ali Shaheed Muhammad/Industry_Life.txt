It's been a minute (Uh-huh)
And since then, a lot of weight is on my plate
I vacate my mind state
You still doubt but my beats bang out
Your  not selling ya out
Age and time made better than wine
My whole lifeline, living in my prime (Whatchu talking about?)
Sorry, uh, it's not radio material
Record execs, you're Helen Keller catching your check
That's okay boss, just know that what we deal is going to cost (Word)
Have to break the bank, pawn us off
Another club jam, (Bam!) what's the deal man?
A brother Shaheed for feeling ya needs (Hey)
You wanted hardcore?
Straight from the veins with no chase
You're slow boy, pick up ya pace
It's laced with knowledge, I'll revelate (They ain't ready)
Life ain't a game kid, don't hesitate (Why ya hesitatin'?)

'Cause you ain't (You're not ready, don't waste time)
Can't catch the groove when you hesitate (You're not ready)
You ain't really ready (You ain't ready)
Mm, mm-mm (You're not ready, don't waste time)
Ooh, you're gonna lose when you hesitate (You're not ready)
You ain't really ready (You ain't ready)
You might also like
Yo wake it up, it's not the place for nappin'
You play into the hands, staying high and slackin' (Word)
Too concerned with ass and fashion
Not too concerned when buildings burn (Baby learn)
They legislate, strike you out to a cell upstate
Assassinate and bomb, raid then you contemplate
(Nah, life is great, I'm riding on 20s)
Real life is getting money, acknowledge that! (Back up off me)
I got you papi, you keep that head Rocky
Get left behind with that frozen mind
I'm movin' with real soldiers in line
I beat-break the dawnin', you play the pawnin'
My position is precision like a gifted premonition
I fade into what you're missin'
Who's got control with a lot of weight? (Uh)
Life is not a game kid, don't hesitate

(You're not ready, don't waste time)
Blow ya mind effin' with this industry life! (You're not ready)
You think you ready? (You ain't ready)
Mm, mm-mm (You're not ready, don't waste time)
Wasting time worshipping this industry life (You're not ready)
You ain't ready (You ain't ready)
And can't keep it steady (You're not ready, don't waste time)
I'm on-point, I don't waste mine (You ain't ready)
You ain't ready now
(You ain't ready) Nah, you ain't ready
(You're not ready, don't waste time)
By the token of time, mankind ain't really ready (You're not ready)
(You ain't ready) And verily, verily and loss, loss
Verily, verily and loss, loss
