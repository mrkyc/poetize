Fannie

Down in Sunflower County where I was born
There used to be a crazy woman
Used to walk bare footed down a gravel road
Singin' in an unknown tongue
One day I asked her papa why she was crazy
And the tears welled up in his eyes
He said, "The Devil's inside my poor baby
She'll be crazy 'til the day she dies

Don't you know she's been hoodooed
By the power of the voodoo?
And you know she's been hoodooed
By the power of the voodoo

Said Fannie always was a peculiar child
And never could make her mind
She used to slip out and go walkin' in the woods late at night
And she always came home cryin'
But then one night she came home laughin'
Talkin' outta her head
She said, "Now I ain't got to worry 'bout dyin', Papa
I been sleepin' in a devil's bed"

Said Fanny's mama was a Voodoo Queen
Died when ol' Fanny was born
He remembered her very last words to him
She said, "I'm goin', honey, take care of Fanny 'til the Devil comes"
So if you see her buried down in a graveyard
Diggin' in a grave for foofoo
You know she's gonna hoodoo somebody
And if you cross her, she might hoodoo you

'Cause you know she's been hoodooed
By the power of the voodoo?
You know she's been hoodooed
By the power of the voodoo
