I saw you tonight
In the room where love had started once before
And we open up the skies with your loving eyes
You take me back where you belong in my heart

(One love frozen in time)
(Never be a bad love, yours and mine)
But I still remain
And I will never change

I will always love you
I will always take your part
And all the years of losing you and then
Being close to you again
The very chance that I could take your heart
Your hand in mine
(You are inside of me)
One more time
(Don't you remember me?)

And the days that lie ahead, they all go wrong
You might also like
But tonight, my love
There's no question in my mind where we should be
And it's clear that you're alone and I'm alone
And all the fools have gone
You open up so tears can fall from your eyes

(True love can never die)
(We can make it one day if we try)
Be there sunshine or rain
And I will never change

I will always love you
I will always take your part
And all the years of losing you and then
Making love to you again
The very chance that I could take your heart
Your hand in mine
(I got a memory)
For all time
(Don't you remember me?)

Now my dream will come true if you love me
I will always love you
And I will always take your part
And all the years of losing you and then
Making love to you again
The very chance that I could take your heart
Your hand in mine

I will always love you
And I will always take your part
And all the years of losing you and then
Making love to you again
The very chance that I could take your heart
