And all I have left now are words you said to me
Sing me a song sweet music man
'Cause I won't be there to hold your hand like I used to
I'm through with you
You're a hell of a singer and a powerful man
But you surround yourself
With people who demand so little of you
You touched my soul with your beautiful song
You even had me singing along right with you
You said "I need you"
Then you changed the words and that harmony
And you sang that song you'd written for me
To someone new
But nobody sings a love song quite like you do
And nobody else can make me sing along
And nobody else can make me feel
That things are right when you know they're wrong
Nobody sings a love song quite like you
Sing me a song sweet music man
Your making a living doing one night stands
That do for you what you need them to
You're still a hell of a singer but a broken man
And you surround yourself with people who demand
So little of you
You might also likeBut nobody sings a love song quite like you do
You travel the world with a six piece band
That does for you what you ask 'em to
And you try to stay up with the songs you sung
To so many people that all begun to come
Back on you
Sing me a song sad music man
You're making your living doing one night
Stands that's do with you they
Don't need you, you're still a helluva singer
But a broken man but you keep on looking for
One last band to sing with you
But nobody sings a love song quite like you do
And nobody else can make me sing along
And nobody else can make me feel
That things are right when you're wrong with a song
Nobody sings a love song quite like you
So sing me a song sweet music man
