Well, I broke the law and I used a gun
I broke the Ten Commandments one by one
Always wished that I'd had a son
Just to teach him not to

I lived in the valley and I hid in the hills
I stole moonshine from illegal stills
Folks said, "Don't rile him 'cause he may kill"
But only if I got to

All I want is a Tennessee bottle
All I need is an Arkansas bride
All I can see is an Ozark mountain sunrise
And five hundred miles to hide my life, life, life, to hide my life
To hide my life

I tried to farm and I tried to mine
I tried cuttin' on the timberline
But pain and sweat was all I'd find
Rewarding all my labor

So I robbed banks and I robbed trains
I lost one eye in a poker game
I gave up gambling 'cause it's such a shame
To cheat your friends and neighbors
You might also like
And all I want is a Tennessee bottle
All I need is an Arkansas bride
All I can see is an Ozark mountain sunrise
And five hundred miles to hide my life, life, life, to hide my life
To hide my life

I think I'm gonna quit and change my ways
Settle down, live an honest day
Someone said that crime don't pay
But I got enough to live on

I think I'm gonna move to Little Rock
Leave my doors without a lock
I might be a foot without a sock
But I got cash to stand on

All I want is a Tennessee bottle
All I need is an Arkansas bride
And all I can see is an Ozark mountain sunrise
Five hundred miles to hide my life, life, life, to hide my life
To hide my life
To hide my life
