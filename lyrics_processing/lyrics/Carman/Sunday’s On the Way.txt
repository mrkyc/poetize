They had beer, Jack Daniels, and pretzels
There was red wine, some white
They were celebrating how they crucified Christ on that tree
But Satan, the snake himself, wasn't so at ease
Well, he took his crooked finger
And he dialed the phone by his bed
To call an old faithful, to see if he was dead
"Hey grave, what's going on, did my plan fail?"
Grave just laughed and said, "The dude's dead as nails."
*chorus*
On Friday night, they crucified the Lord at calvary
But he said, "Don't dread, three days' later I'll live again, you'll see!"
When problems try to bury you, make it hard to pray
It may seem like Friday night, but Sunday's on the way!
A tranquilizer and a horror filck, couldn't calm Satan's fears
So Saturday night, he calls up the grave, scared of what he'd hear
"Hey, grave, what's going on?"
Grave said, "Man, you done called me twice
And I'll tell you one-more-'gin, boss, the Jew's on ice."
Satan said, " Man grave, you remember when
Ol' Lazarus, was in his grave
Everything was cool then four days later...BOOM
Ol' Lazarus, he was raised
Now, this Jesus, he is much more trouble
Than anyone has ever been to me
And this man said he only gonna be dead, for three days."

Sunday morning Satan woke with a jump
Ready to blow a fuse
He was shaking from the tips of his pointy ears
To the toes of his pointy shoes
"Hey grave, is he alive, I don't wanna lose my neck?"
Grave said , "Satan, you are a wreck
Cool your jets Big D, my sting is still intact
Jesus is dead forever, he ain't
Never coming back
So mellow out man, just go drink up or shoot up
Just leave old grave alone
And I'll catch you la...la...
Oh no! Oh no! OH NO! OH NO!
Somebody's messing with the stone!"
Well, the stone was rolled away
And it ounced a time or two
And an angel stepped inside
And said, "I'm Gabriel, who are you?
If you're wondering where the Lord is
At this very hour
I tell you he's alive and well
With resurection power!"
