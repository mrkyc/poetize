Violently they grabbed his arms
As they tightly strapped each wrist
With a hellish look stood a strong armed soldier
Whip clenched in his fist
Laced with chips of bone they beat him hard
From his shoulders to his feet
And it sliced right through his olive skin
Just like razors through a sheet
Countless times the blood splattered
As each in-human lash was given
Several times his knees gave way
As his flesh just hung like rivets
And surprisingly he turned his head
Though the words he used were few
The soldiers face turned pale
When he said "This blood is for you"
Uncaringly they tossed a garment
Across his weakened form
And his blood pressure fell deathly low
As the crowds began to swarm
They forced him to carry his cross up-hill
As his face they punched and smacked
All the splinters from the criss crossed beam dug deep into his back
Through lack of sleep and dehydration
His tongue began to swell
And weakened by his loss of blood
This prophet-teacher fell
When he did some blood splattered
On a man named Simons shoe
As he bent to wipe it off
The prophet looked and said
"Simon this blood is for you"

Heal the sick, mend the heart
This blood can give you access
To the very throne of God
And it still can go the distance
From the pain to where you are
This blood is for you
The blood of the lamb
Then they pounded a spike
Through the bones in his wrists
Bursting arteries, and veins
And as they dropped the cross in the hole they dug
His body convulsed with pain
Through the agony and torment
That never a soul shall find
He tilts his face towards heaven
With full control of his mind
With more love then any human heard
Before that time or since
He made a statement that to this day
Makes the strongest skeptic wince
He cried "Father, God forgive them for they not what they do."
And as he gave his life for those lost in sin
He was saying
"This blood is for you!"
This blood can save the soul
Heal the sick, mend the heart
This blood can give you access
To the very throne of God
And it still can go the distance
From the pain to where you are
This blood is for you
(If you're lost and alone, and your mind is confused)
This blood is for you
(If you feel like you have been hurt and abused)
This blood is for you
The Atoning cleansing blood of the Lamb
This blood can save the soul
Heal the sick, mend the heart
This blood can give you access
To the very throne of God
And it still can go the distance
From the pain to where you are
This blood is for you
The blood of the lamb
This Blood is for you
