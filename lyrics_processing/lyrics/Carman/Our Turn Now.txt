Upon thee, and beg for thy blessings upon us
Our parents, our teachers and our country"
"Good evening. This is Charlene Lewis for the 6:00 news. Today, June 25, 1962, the Supreme Court has ruled that school prayer and Bible reading shall cease in all public school systems. It is now official; God has been removed from the classroom in the United States of America."

The ball got dropped in '62
They wouldn't let children pray in school
Violent crime began to rise
The grades went down and the kids got high
Free love, gay rights
No absolutes, abortion on demand
Brought VD, AIDS, and no morality
Today no one knows right from wrong
There's blood on people's hands
World, you had your turn at bat
Now stand back and see
That it's our turn now
Something's gonna change
We're gonna bind the devil
At every hand by the power of Jesus' name
Well, it's our turn now, think it no surprise
When the gates of hell come crashing down
And you begin to see the church arise

With the Ten Commandments on their wall
God's Word in the library won't appear
(no no nowhere)
We have a religious apartheid here
Humanism, atheism, no Bible
Our consciences have died
We need to seek our God and call His name
The church triumphant's still alive and
We're gonna turn the tide
'Cause with boldness and conviction
We proclaim
That it's our turn now
Something's gonna change
We're gonna bind the devil
At every hand by the power of Jesus' name
Well, it's our turn now, think it no surprise
When the gates of hell come crashing down
And you begin to see the church arise
Arise and shine, for the Light has come
It's time to lift the name of Jesus high x4
Yes, it's our turn now
Something's gonna change
We're gonna bind that devil
At every hand by the power of Jesus' name
It's our turn now, think it no surprise
When the gates of hell come crashing down
You begin to see the church arise
It's our turn - now
It's no surprise
To See those gates of hell crash down
