He that believeth in me
Though he were dead
Yet shall he live
A certain man had died
In the town of Bethany
And Lazarus was his name
The Bible says he was
A man that Jesus loved
And his sisters thought
It was a shame
Mary and Martha longed
For Jesus healing touch
To come and raise their brother
Cause they loved that boy so much
But Jesus had a plan not known to any man
That would soon take away their pain
They was waiting for Jesus
To come and say
Chorus:
Lazarus, Lazarus, Lazarus Come Forth
When he died he went to where
The saints of God did stay
In the holding place
They lived beyond the tomb
And there he saw Elijah, Moses, Samuel, even Ruth
And all the others jammed up in a room
He turned around and saw
Ol' Gideon standin' by the door
He walked up and said hey brother
What's this group here for
Well Giddie said
Well alright this is testimony night
Have a seat man cause
The meeting is starting soon
While Mary and Martha
Just wanted to see

Lazarus, Lazarus, Lazarus Come Forth
Moses shook his stick
Said now this meeting come to order
Can I get a witness
For the Lord tonight
Abraham kicked it off
Said I want y'all know
That I knew him
He gave a child to my barren wife
Isaac waived his hand said
Hey daddy I knew him too
Jacob jumped up says
Amen Grandpa, preach it
Old dignified Solomon
Adjusted his robe and said
I knew him, He made me so smart
I started to teach it
Ezekiel said I knew him
As a wheel within a wheel
Job said man he healed me
When I was almost dead
Sampson said I knew him
When some Philistines tried to jump me
I took a donkey jawbone and busted a few heads
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego said
We knew him in the fiery furnace
Jonah said man he gave me a second chance
Daniel cried out I knew him
In a hungry den of lions
The Holy Ghost hit King David
He just started to dance
Lazarus got so excited
He shouted Hey I knew him too
Moses put down his stick
Said hey who's the new kid
Needless to say the room got real quiet
When Lazarus said But I knew him
In a way you all never did
You see man I walked with him and talked with him
I saw how his teachings awed the crowds
Those famous tears of compassion I could actually see
He used to come over to my house after church
And my sisters would make him dinner
And every month I even supported his ministry
You see man I watched him confront the Pharisees
I was there when he fed the five thousand
I heard the people gasp when he healed the lame
You see man I even remember the littlest things
The things that most folks would forget
Like the simple, loving way He'd just call my name
Up at the grave stone rolled away
With a loud voice Jesus started to say, Lazarus
You see it just seems like yesterday
I could hear that man saying my name
Lazarus
As a matter of a fact it seemed like today
Lazarus
Excuse me brothers I think I hear him calling me now
Lazarus
Jesus
Lazarus....Jesus
Lazarus....Jesus
Lazarus....Jesus
Lazarus....Hey Jesus
Lazarus, Come Forth
Come Forth, I command you, Come Forth
Jesus said, Lazarus, Lazarus, Lazarus Come Forth
Like he was saying sickness be healed
Mountains be moved
When he said, Lazarus Come Forth
Mary don't weep Martha don't moan
Here come your boy Comin' Forth
He that believeth in me
Though he were dead
