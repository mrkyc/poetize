I'm huntin' for someone y'all
He's a lyin' thievin'rattlesnake
And he's broken every law
He's terrorized the lives
Of men and he's under arrest
Because I've been sent
With a warrant from the body of Christ
-Well, tell me what it says then! -
"Satan, bite the dust!"
Every one of you unclean spirits
I'm runnin' you outta town
Depression, strife
Disease and fear, your posse's goin' down
-Boy, last tenderfoot who
Talked that big we sent him home in a box -
But I know who I am
Through Jesus Christ so I talk to you demons like dogs
Satan you coward, you molester of souls
I command you to appear
You're hidin' from the presence of God but
I can feel your fear from here
-You rattled my chain, boy, long enough, you
Got something in your craw? -
A praying church wants you to know
- Know what? -
Your kingdom's gonna fall
-There's gonna be
Trouble here tonight -

'Cause I represent a
Whole new breed of Christian of today
And I'm authorized and
Deputized to blow you clean away
I've got a message to
Deliver from One who's true and just
We'll spit in your eye
You father of lies
Satan, bite the dust!
-Boy, you gonna take me on and my unholy herd?-
Not only take you on, but
Take you out by the Spirit and the Word
One by one you'll drop
Like flies under foot and in the ground
Because greater is He who is in me
Than the snake I'm starin' down
You demon of alcoholism
You'll be the first to go
There's deliverance from you
Through Jesus Christ, so, hit the road!
You spirit of infirmity
You ain't welcome here no more
We lay hands on the sick
And they recover so, out the door!
You demon of false religion
You've preyed on minds so simple
I bind the spirit of your songs
So el kabong!
Play that in your temple!
Now Satan you're next in line
I'm gonna hit you where it hurts
'Cause I'm tired of you in
My family and I'm tired
Of you in my church
I'm not my own
I'm bought with a price
I'm a Holy Ghost filled man
And I'm tollin' the bell of
Your eternal destruction
'cross the land
CHORUS(2):
'Cause I represent a
Whole new breed of Christian of today
And I'm authorized and
Deputized to blow you clean away
I've got a weapon with
Two bullets that overcome all sin and crud
One bullet is called the word of my testimony
And the other one's called The Blood
Satan, bite the dust!
Bite the dust!
Well how do you feel about that, devil?
-I'm afeelin' mighty low-
