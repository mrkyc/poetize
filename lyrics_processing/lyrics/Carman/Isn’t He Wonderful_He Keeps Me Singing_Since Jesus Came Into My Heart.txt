Jesus, my Lord, he's wonderful
Jesus, my Lord
Isn't he wonderful, wonderful, wonderful
Isn't Jesus, my Lord, wonderful
Eyes have seen
Ears have heard
It's recorded in God's word
Isn't Jesus, my Lord, wonderful
Isn't he wonderful, wonderful, wonderful
Isn't Jesus, my Lord, wonderful
Eyes have seen
Ears have heard
It's recorded in God's word
Isn't Jesus, my Lord, wonderful

Play it, Dave
Isn't Jesus, my Lord, wonderful
You might also like
There's within my heart a melody
Jesus whispers sweet and low:
"Fear not; I am with thee
Peace; be still,"
In all of life's ebb and flow

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Sweetest name I know
Fills my every longing
Keeps me singing as I go

Soon he's coming back to welcome me
Far beyond the starry sky
I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown
I shall reign with him on high

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
The sweetest name I know
He fills my every longing
Keeps me singing as I go

Since Jesus came into, came into my heart
Since Jesus came into, came into my heart
Floods of joy o'er my soul
Like the sea billows roll
Since Jesus came into my heart
Since Jesus came into my heart
Came into my heart
Since Jesus came into my heart
Came into my heart
Floods of joy o'er my soul
Like the sea billows roll
Since Jesus came into my heart

Isn't he wonderful, wonderful, wonderful
Isn't Jesus, my Lord, wonderful
Eyes have seen
Ears have heard
It's recorded in God's word
Isn't Jesus, my Lord
Wonderful
So wonderful
Isn't Jesus, my Lord
Wonderful
Jesus, he's wonderful
Jesus, my Lord
Mmmmm, ohh
Jesus, my Lord, he's wonderful
Jesus, my Lord
Jesus
Jesus, he's wonderful
Jesus, my Lord
Ohh

He's wonderful
Jesus, my Lord
Isn't Jesus, my Lord
Wonderful
Jesus, Jesus, my Lord
