That we were taught that we could praise the Lord in seven ways
Seven great expressions, seven different flows
Seven ways to worship God and this is how it goes
Number one is towdah (towdah), it's the sacrifice
Praising God inspite the fact that your world is in a vice
It's praise that pushes through the wall of all adversity
An offering that flows to heaven in our time of need
Somebody say mind (mind)
Praise the Lord (e)
Say body (body)
Praise the Lord (e)
Say body (body)
Praise the Lord (e)
Spirit (spirit)
Praise the Lord (e)
Number two's yadah (yadah), that means to lift your hands (lift your hands)
In response to what the Lord has done through the land
An outward sign of what's inside for all the world to see
A demonstration of our love so come praise the Lord with me
Can you wave one hand and say praise the Lord (praise the Lord)
Can you wave both hands and say praise the Lord (praise the Lord)
Now can you clap those hands and say praise the Lord (praise the Lord)
You might also likeNumber three is barouch (barouch), that simply means to bow
In the awesome presence of the Lord and all His power
To just be overwhelmed 'cause you hardly can believe
That you've been given favor by His Holy Majesty
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
This fourth one is shabach (shabach), it is what we call the shout
It's praise that's given way before the answer comes about
A public testimony that drowns out all the noise
Of whiners and complainers as the saints all lift their voice
If you believe that God's alive today, shout yeah (yeah)
If you believe that He's worthy of our praise, shout yeah (yeah)
If you believe the answer's on the way, shout yeah (yeah)
Number five is zamar (zamar), this one you'll like fore sure
It's playing any instrument that glorifies the Lord
Instruments that blast, instruments that strum
Instruments that keep the beat, so I'll praise Him on my drum
Six we call halell (halell), that means to rave and boast
And praise the Lord in such a way that gets you on your toes
(Wait a minute, wait a minute) What (Hey now, what did you say)
It's beyond just clappin' hands
But best of all, this is the one that makes you wanna dance
Finally tehillah (tehillah), seven is the best
It's the one that is the combination of the rest
It's singing and it's shouting, it's dancing and it's more
It's wild, it's fun so everyone rejoice before the Lord
Praise the Lord (e)
Praise the Lord (e)
Praise the Lord (e)
Seven ways we can say
