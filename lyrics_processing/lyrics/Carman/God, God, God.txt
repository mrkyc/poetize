While I was fryin' eggs in my kitchen
They looked so sincere with their white shirts and ties
As they tried to sell me their religion
We talked for a while as my eggs got cold
About what their faith believes
And they said they were convinced by what they'd been taught
That God's an exalted man like you and me
Well, though the Book says He's spirit
Their hearts refused to hear it
They proceeded to tell me He's got hair
"Why, in Daniel, God's finger wrote on the wall
And His watchful eye is mentioned everywhere."
I said, "Take heed to your scriptures until you understand
Completely these verses you're pickin'
The Psalms say He'll protect us with His feathers and His wings
But that don't mean that God's a great big chicken!"
I said, "Don't you see, you have missed
Just who Jesus Christ says that he is
Well, he's the Lord, he's Jehovah
He's the I Am like he said
And he proved his own divinity
When he rose up from the dead
He's Messiah, Emmanuel
And if that don't pass the test
The book of John says he's The Word of God come in the flesh
And, well, he's the author of salvation
And he leaves no room to guess:
He's the alpha, omega, beginning and end
He's the first and he's the last
So if you're still confused, I've no words left to waste
He told us he was God, God, God;
Now I calmly rest my case."
You might also likeI went out to the airport, took a ride to LAX
I was flying out to Dallas to see my buddy Tex
I went up the escalator, my mind at total rest
When suddenly dis guy pins a flower to my chest
I asked him, "You a Christian?"; he said, "Oh yes, and more
But I believe there's many ways of truth we can explore."
I said, "Hold on a minute, I have to interrupt
If Jesus ain't the only way, this teaching is corrupt."
He said, "Now, we believe and teach that when you die
You come back in the form of a cow, a bird, or a fly
So if you kill an animal, what actually you're seeing
Is a murder equal to that of a human being."
Well, as anyone can see their "Christian" claims
Are totally, without a doubt, phony
You can't even go out and, uhhh, eat a Big Mac
'Cause you might be munching on your Uncle Tony!
I said, "Don't you see, you have missed

So he leaves no room to guess:
He's the alpha, omega, beginning and end
He's the first and he's the last
And if you're still confused, just so no one will miss
He told us he was God
He proved that he was God
He taught us he was God, God, God
