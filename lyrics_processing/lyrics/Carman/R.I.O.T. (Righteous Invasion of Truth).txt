Uproar in a public place, turbulent right in your face
With the facts we're gonna spread God's Word
And attack every lie you've heard
Like the doctrines of men that are still fallen prey
To the silvery sword of God's Word today
It's true, we look to heaven and our mansions in the sky
And it's true we've got the gaze of eternity in our eyes
But before this church is raptured
There's no way we're gonna leave here quiet
We want a righteous invasion of truth
We want a R.I.O.T
Jesus, we're callin' on Your name
Jesus, we're gonna see a change
Jesus, we're taking on Goliath
With a righteous invasion of truth
We're want a R.I.O.T
Righteous - to conform to the Bible
Invasion an armed attack
Of truth - the real state of affairs
Like a church on the move that will not double back
From the fight, 'cause we're salt and light
And we thrive on Jesus, the theme of our lives
And here's the spin
Love nothin' but God, hate nothin' but sin
It's true, now the time to win nations for the Lord
And it's true, now the hour, the saints must go to war
We'll preach it, we'll sing it
We'll shout it, we'll cry it
'Cause desperate times need desperate action and that means
We need a R.I.O.T
You might also likeSatan is a madman, a relentless entity
He's the source of every plague known to the human family
We understand the mortal conflict in which we are engaged
And the gates of hell come crashing down when the saints of God begin to praise
Jesus, we're callin' on Your name
Jesus, we're gonna see a change
Jesus, we're taking on Goliath
With a righteous invasion of truth
We want a R.I.O.T
Jesus, we're callin' on Your name
Jesus, we need to see a change
Jesus, we're taking on Goliath
With a righteous invasion of truth
We want a R.I.O.T
With a righteous invasion of truth
