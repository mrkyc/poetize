Into the valley of the war
To face the giant who threatened God's people
Clad in the armour of the LORD
Those around him doubted any kind of victory
Even before it all began
Then the giant looked down
And laughed in David's face
And said, "Do you know who I am?
Man, I'm Goliath, I'm your enemy
The power of Death is within my command
Man, I'm Goliath, open your eyes
I can bury you right where you stand
I'm your ultimate nightmare, the reality of Fear
My threats have been intimidating people now for years
You dumb religious fool, just get on out of here
'Cause I'm Goliath."
Then something hit old David, a revelation so it seemed
And a holy anger drilled him
And the boy got spittin' mean
And it shot right through the fibers of his spirit like a beam
And all across the countryside, everybody heard him scream
Prepare to Die
Prepare to Die
I've got a message from the God of whom you have defied
You come against me with your weapons from Hell
You come against me with your fearful evil spell
But I come against you in the name of the God of the armies of Israel
Prepare to Die
You might also likeSometimes we walk out, nervouce and excited
Into the valley of our war
To face the giant who threatens God's people
Clad in the armour of the LORD
Those around us doubt any kind of victory
Even before it all began
Then our giant looks down and laughs in our face
And says, " 'Ey, do you know who I am?
I'm Depression, I'm your enemy
The power of Death is within my command
Hey, I'm Leukemia, open your eyes
I can bury you right where you stand
I'm your ultimate nightmare, the reality of fear
My threats have been intimidating people now for years
You dumb religious fool, just get on out of here
'Cause I'm Cancer."
Then something will hit your soul, a revelation so it seems
And a holy anger will drill you
And boy, you get spittin' mean
And it will shoot right through the fibers of your spirit like a beam
And all across the countryside, everybody will hear you scream
Prepare to Die
Cancer, prepare to Die
I've got a message from the God of whom you have defied
You come against me with your weapons from Hell
You come against me with your fearful evil spell
But I come against you in the name of the God of the armies of Israel
Prepare to Die
Leukemia, prepare to Die
For the last time
You come against me with your weapons from Hell
You come against me with your fearful evil spell
But I come against you in the name of the God of the armies of Israel
