I've learned to let go
Come on

Here's a middle finger coming straight from OCA-L-A
I appreciate your judgement, it's proved I can't trust a word you say
Those must be some pair of binoculars that you see every move I make
So I'll never be a liar but you'll always be two-faced

You'll get what's coming to you
You're blinded by your instincts
I'm not your fucking game
I'm not so easily beat

I'm looking down at this mess that you've made
And I can't believe that I stayed
So unhappy for so long
Where did I go wrong?
I've got to get out of this
My hand is on the handle
And we're leaving everything behind
Goodbye for a lifetime

I'll rip that scandalous bitch in two
We'll bring the noise

Try to pretend that I never even knew your name
'Cause everything you are disgusts me
(Too bad I can't turn back time)
So I wouldn't be here
What I'd give for you to disappear
So tell me, girly, how's your edge?

You've got nothing better to do
I know why you can't see straight
I thought you were better than this
You're just like everyone else

I'm looking down at this mess that you've made
And I can't believe that I stayed
So unhappy for so long
Where did I go wrong?
I've got to get out of this
My hand is on the handle
And we're leaving everything behind
Goodbye for a lifetime
I'll make my stand
Right here with my friends
I'll make my stand
Right here with my friends
I'll make my stand
Right here with my friends
I'll make my stand
Right here with my friends
I'll make my stand
Right here with my friends
Get low

Now I know who my friends are
