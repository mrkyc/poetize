So, I say goodbye to a town that has ears and eyes
I can hear you whispering as I walk by (As I walk by)
Familiar faces smiling back at me
And I knew this would make them change (Make them change)

The only thing that's going to bother me
Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends
Why can't you look me in the eyes one last time?

The writing's on the wall, you've read that I'll be gone
But if you call my name, just know that I'll come running
For one more night to spare with you
This is where I'm meant to be, please, don't leave me

I've read these stories a thousand times and now I'll rewrite them all
You're meddling in an anger you can't control
She means the world to me, so hold your serpent tongue
Is a whore's lies worth dying for? Trust me, I'm done!

The only thing that's going to bother me
Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends
Why can't you look me in the eyes one last time?

But if you call my name, just know that I'll come running
For one more night to spare with you

I walked into your house this morning
I brought the gun from our end table
Your blood was strewn across the walls
They'll find you on your bathroom floor
I walked into your house this morning
I brought the gun from our end table
Your blood was strewn across the walls
They'll find you on your bathroom floor when I'm done!

But should I write it all off?
But should I write it all off?
(You should have killed me when you had the chance)
But should I write it all off?
(You should have killed me when you had the chance)
But should I?

You should have killed me when you had the chance
