It's Monday morning, and I would kill for a chance to drive
Get so far away from here, with you, my dear, that I'll never leave your side
Nobody knows the troubles I've seen
In a van, on a soapbox for the world to see

Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me
To be a monument for the rest of them
Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me
To be a monument for the rest of them

We're getting older, I've started to fear for my life
Is this the way that it should be? This whole thing's riding on me
It's been a long road so far with nowhere to turn
There's no looking back from here, no more dwelling on my fears

Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me
To be a monument for the rest of them
Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me
To be a monument for the rest of them

Let nothing stand in our way
