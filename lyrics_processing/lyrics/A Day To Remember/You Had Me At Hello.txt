I'm missing you so much, I'll say you died tonight
Just so I can get to you before the sun will rise
I know these times are hard, and I feel this too
None of that ever seems to matter when I'm holding you

And I'm wasting away, away from you
And I'm wasting away, away from you

What have I gotten into
This time around?
I know that I had sworn I'd never trust anyone again
But I didn't have to, you had me at hello

I've never seen a smile that can light the room like yours
It's simply radiant, I see it more with every day that goes by
I watch the clock to make my timing just right
Would it be okay? Would it be okay if I took your breath away?

And I'm wasting away, away from you
And I'm wasting away, away from you

You gave me butterflies at the mailbox
