Here we go again, another night of being bummed
I'll keep to myself, avoid the sun, and cancel plans with everyone I know
'Cause it's just how it always ends, our bond will break
'Cause you can't relate to anyone, to anything at all

You brought your worst, and I'm right here (Right here)
No, I've seen it all, and it's never been so clear

You're not the person that I knew back then (Back then)
It's all too late to set things right, 'cause everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then (Back then)
Let's try and act like this didn't happen
Follow your friends, like you ever had them

You still know me, still not cut out for this sort of thing
Never wanna be caught in between, I need constant reminders of everything
(So what?) It's who I am, I played it off so well
I just hold it in no matter how I've been, so nobody, nobody can tell

You brought your worst and I'm right here (Right here)
No, I've seen it all, and it's never been so clear

It's all too late to set things right, 'cause everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then (Back then)
Let's try and act like this didn't happen
Follow your friends, like you ever had them

I won't sleep 'til the break of dawn (Break of dawn)
Can't let our problems find me here
So everybody, come on!

You brought your worst, and I'm right here
I've seen it all, and it's never been so clear

You're not the person that I knew back then (Back then)
It's all too late to set things right, 'cause everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then (Back then)
