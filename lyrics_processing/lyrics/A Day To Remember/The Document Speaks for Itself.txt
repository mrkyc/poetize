Hey Drew, Tony from Victory, 12:30 in the morning in Chicago
Just saw the video, man, Victory proof, huh? I'm gonna sue you, boy!
Do ya hear me, son? I'm gonna sue you, you're gonna get sued, son!
Be careful, get your lawyers, 'cause you're gonna get sued!

You're all about you, and it's my fast track to
An early grave, just need to see this through
Do you even sleep at night?
Where does your conscience run to hide?

I gotta get out, I gotta get out
Why can't you just do what's right by me?
I gotta get out, I gotta get out
It can't get much harder, harder to breathe
The room keeps spinning faster, I'm drifting off to sleep
Hope it's seen beyond these walls you're suffocating me

Why can't you see what three little words have done to me?
I never knew I was alone, you turned your back, you broke this home
Took me so long to find the answers and your reasons why
I just wanted things to be alright, or at least for just tonight

How's living a lie? You never could face me
And you hide behind fake personalities
Because deep down you're scared
So weak beyond compare

I gotta get out, I gotta get out
Why can't we just go our separate ways?
I gotta get out, I gotta get out
It won't be much farther, I'm counting the days
The room keeps spinning faster, I'm drifting off to sleep
Hope it's seen beyond these walls you're suffocating me

Why can't you see what three little words have done to me?
I never knew I was alone, you turned your back, you broke this home
Took me so long to find the answers and your reasons why
I just wanted things to be alright, or at least for just tonight

My friends still stand behind me
We stuck together through all we lost
Even when your worst surrounds me
You'll never get the best of us, what?
My friends still stand behind me
We stuck together through all we lost
Even when your worst surrounds me
You'll never get the best of us
Why can't you see what three little words have done to me?
I never knew I was alone, you turned your back, you broke this home
Took me so long to find the answers, and your reasons why
I just wanted things to be alright, or at least for just tonight

No fucking respect
All hail the thief forever trying to separate you and me
All hail the thief forever trying to separate
No fucking respect

And...
It's taking forever
Oh, God
That's a fuckin' heavy email
Yeah!
We're fucked!
