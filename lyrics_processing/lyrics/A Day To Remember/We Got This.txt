To anyone who's alone in a crowded room
Put your hands up high, sing it out of tune
It's these late night hours we spend that help me up from down

You're just like me when I was your age
We all knew better, name it, we've been there
When I had a place that I couldn't call my own
We spent most days, counting the ways
We would get through it, but they said we're stupid
Now all those kids say they knew us so well
Come on, get real

To anyone who's alone in a crowded room
Put your hands up high, sing it out of tune
It's these late night hours we spend that help me up from down
We got this

I'm not afraid of anything
Here's to the future
It was nice that I knew you
Go find something that makes you feel complete
'Til the next time we meet
