I am fueled by all forms of failure
I paid the price, so I'll take what's mine

Oh, I bet ya didn't see that one coming
'Cause I do as I please, and apologize for nothing
My time is flying, but I'm still second to none
Always shining the brightest when I'm placed under the gun

Goddamn! So here I stand
The only son of a working-class man
I won't be held back
I can't be held down

Where were you when my walls came falling down?
They came falling down
You tried to hide, you stood close by
And didn't make a sound
Say something

Find you some paper, and I'll go grab you a pen
You can start taking notes on how this all started again
Been dead last, but found my way to the front
With my inspirational quotes on why I never gave up, what?

Where were you when my walls came falling down?
They came falling down
You tried to hide, you stood close by
And didn't make a sound
Where were you when it all came back around?
It goes back around
The reasons why you passed me by
Will always hold you down
Say something

If you can't stand the pressure
Stay the fuck out of my way, I know my place
This one goes out to everyone who's lied to my face
My heart is filled with hate

I'm making a difference
I'm taking a chance (a chance)
You can say what you want about me
But no one can tell me I can't

Where were you when my walls came falling down?
They came falling down
You tried to hide, you stood close by
And didn't make a sound
Where were you when it all came back around?
It goes back around
The reasons why you passed me by
Will always hold you down
