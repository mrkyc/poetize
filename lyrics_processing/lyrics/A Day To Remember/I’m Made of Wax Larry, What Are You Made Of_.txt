Don't blink, they won't even miss you at all
And don't think that I'll always be gone
You know, I've got you like a puppet in the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down!

So run like hell
Sleep with one eye open, I can't forgive or forget you
We'll tell everyone the damage done
Deep down, you can't stop me, you can't stop me now!

I'll be there just to watch you fall
So don't push me, I've got nothing to lose

Don't blink, they won't even miss you at all
And don't think that I'll always be gone
You know, I've got you like a puppet in the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down!

Here I go again
I made it so damn hard to come back from the mess that you're in
I need you to know, I told you so
You're a snake and I'm cautious, just use your head!

Everybody's out to get me, any moment could be my last
This is me, you can take it or leave

Just breathe
