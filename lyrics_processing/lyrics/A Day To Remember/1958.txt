And shepherds we shall be
For thee, my lord, for thee
Power hath descended forth from thy hand
That our feet may swiftly carry out thy command
So, we shall flow river forth to thee
And teeming with souls, shall it ever be
In nomine patris, et filli
Et spiritus sancti

You've sunk lower than I've ever seen
And even though you deserved this, I tried to catch your fall
I've grown so tired of your childish threats
Know that I'll never run from anything

And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure, and that you won't make it out alive
And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure, and that you won't make it out alive

Here's where we prove all your fairy tales wrong, this all stops
Tonight, swim in your sea of smoke, until your lungs lose the fight
It's over, this all stops tonight
Or prove me wrong

What have you become through your jealousy?
You've threatened my life, my friends, and family
This is your last wrong turn in your life
And this dead end leads to a blood bath, your blood bath

And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure, and that you won't make it out alive
And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure, and that you won't make it out alive

Here's where we prove all your fairy tales wrong, this all stops
Tonight, swim in your sea of smoke, until your lungs lose the fight
It's over, this all stops tonight

You'll never stop us with your one-man army
We would burn him alive!
You'll never stop us with your one-man army
If you're such a man, then bring the fight!
You'll never stop us with your one-man army
We would burn him alive!
You'll never stop us with your one-man army
If you're such a man, then bring the fight!
This is me calling you out, you want to talk like a man, then
Be a man, stop talking like you're something (We're paging 1958)
You always have so much to say, but it's never to our faces
I'm right here (We're paging 1958)
We're all one and the same
We're moving on, and living our dreams (We're paging 1958)
We're all one and the same
