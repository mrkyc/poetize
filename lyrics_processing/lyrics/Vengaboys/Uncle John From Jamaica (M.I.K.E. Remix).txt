8 o'clock get up get outta bed
I feel like a truck ran over my head
Another day of stress and sorrow
Skip breakfast cause I gotta go
Ain't got no time to take it slow
And I will do my hair tomorrow

I can't take it no more
Oh no no no

6 o'clock my job is still not done
The life I'm living ain't no fun
Too many days of stress and sorrow
My boss just won't give me a break
And this is more than I can take
Think I will quit this job tomorrow

I can't take it no more
Oh no no no
Is this what I'm living for
