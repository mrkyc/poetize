When he returned, little Delia had gone to rest
The angels laid her away
Louis said to Delia
"That's the sad thing with life
There's people always leavin' just as other folks arrive"
The angels laid her away
When the people heard Delia was dead
All of them gentlemen they dressed in red
The angels laid her away
Angels laid her away
Laid her six feet under the clay
The angels laid her away
Louis went downtown for a new suit of clothes
He's gonna dress up for Delia like a fine red rose
The angels laid him away
He brought a ten-gallon Stetson
It was ox blood red
Stacker Lee shot Louis in the back of the head
The angels laid him away
You might also likeOh Stacker Lee said to Louis
'Oh now don't you grieve. I'm sending you to Delia, you won't ever have to leave.'
The angels laid him away
Angels laid him away
They laid him six feet under the clay
The angels laid him away
Well the judge was a mean one
His name was Hangin' Billy Lyons
He said "You've always been a bad man, Stack, you gonna hang this time
The angels lay you away."
And the jailer said to Stacker Lee 'What's the problem with you?"
'Aw jailer, Louis Collins' ghost brought Delia's with him, too."
The angels laid them away
Angels laid him away
They laid him six feet under the clay
The angels laid him away
Well they buried little Delia
In the church yard deep
With Louis Collins at her head
Stacker Lee at her feet
The angels laid them away
And out of Delia's bed came briars
Out of Louis' bed a rose
Out of Stacker Lee's came Stacker Lee's cold lonely little ghost
Angels laid them away
And I'm looking over rooftops
And I'm hoping that it ain't true
That the same God looks out for them Looks out for me and you
Angels laid them away
Angels laid them away
