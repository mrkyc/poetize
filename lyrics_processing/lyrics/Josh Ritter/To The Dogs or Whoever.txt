Down with the deep blue jail around her
Running her hands through the ribs of the dark
Florence and Calamity and Joan of Arc
I love the way she looks in her underwear
I lose my page then the book then the plot then I swear
She makes the most of her time by loving me plenty
She knows there'll come a day when we won't be getting any
The stain of the sepia the butcher Crimea
Through the wreck of a brass band I thought I could see her
In a cakewalk she came through the dead and the lame
Just a little bird floating on a hurricane
I was flat on my back, my feet in the thorns
I was in between the apples and the chloroform
She came to me often, I was sure I was dying
It was always hard to tell if she was laughing or crying
I thought I heard somebody calling
In the dark I thought I heard somebody call
Joan never cared about the in-betweens
Combed her hair with a blade did the Maid of Orleans
Said Christ walked on water, we can wade through the war
You don't need to tell me who the fire is for
You might also likeOh bring me a love that can sweeten the sword
A boat that can love the rocks or the shore
The love of an iceberg reaching out for the wreck
Can you love me like the crosses love the nape of the neck?
Was it Casey Jones or Casey at the Bat
Who died out of pride and got famous for that?
Killed by a swerve, laid low by the curve
Do you ever think they ever thought they got what they deserved?
Don't pity the bullet, but pity the man
Who both find their place in the same sad plan
Who both are like the barrel going over the falls
Crying all the way down I never asked to be involved
I thought I heard somebody calling
In the dark I thought I heard somebody call
General George began the day by taking pink little pills
Sent his men to the top of some hell of a hill
Through the whisper of trees came artillery breeze
He said I love the way the wind comes a'tickling my knees
Jane shot the apple right between the eyes
I was thinking of her when you came outside
Lemonade on your breath, sun in your hair
Did I mention how I love you in your underwear?
Deep in the belly of a whale I found her
Down with the deep blue jail around her
Running her hands through the ribs of the dark
Florence and Calamity and Joan of Arc
I thought I heard somebody calling
