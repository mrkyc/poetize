Sometimes it's hard to carry this great weight
Either bound to burn or to the pearly gates
And I'm as aimless as can be
Often nameless though I'm free
Oh Lord, will You have a plan for me?

I've been kicked out of Texas
Stole an infamous necklace
Became a spiritual master
Got rejected by Vassar
A cool head in the game
Of whatever I'm playing
I'm the favorite of babies
Society mavens

Whoa Lord (Oh Lord)
Whoa Lord (Oh Lord)
Will You ever ever have a plan for me?

I have marveled at splendors
Upended the vendors
Been kidnapped and ransomed
Just a little too handsome
You might also likeAnd more than a few times
I've lived without sunshine
And yes I've wondered
Should a life be a lifetime

Whoa Lord (Oh Lord)
Whoa Lord (Oh Lord)
Will You ever ever have a plan for me?

I'm dedicated to freedom
The American Legion
I got invited to Paris
By a real Parisian
I've been the best and the worstest
Composed my own curses
Got my heart broke so bad
They had to call in the nurses

Whoa Lord (Oh Lord)
Whoa Lord (Oh Lord)
Will You ever ever have a plan for me?
I have had good intentions
Blue-blooded pretensions
I've been the subject of rumors
At the party conventions
My feature's harmonic
Wisdom Solomonic
If there's a board of directors
You can bet that I'm on it

Whoa Lord (Oh Lord)
Whoa Lord (Oh Lord)
Will You ever ever have a plan for me?
Whoa Lord (Oh Lord)
Whoa Lord (Oh Lord)
Will You ever ever have a plan for me?

I take my place with the ages
Belong to the sages
Give my clothes to the poor and
My love to the ladies
May all them wish me
Commandant of history
Write books all about how
Every one of them miss me

Whoa Lord (Oh Lord)
Whoa Lord (Oh Lord)
Will You ever ever have a plan for me?

And so for now I go aimless
Convicted though blameless
At times using nicknames
At times going nameless
Royalty unquestioned
A gentleman of discretion
Y'all sing Hallelujah
For here ends the lesson

Whoa Lord (Oh Lord)
Whoa Lord (Oh Lord)
Will You ever ever have a plan for me?
Whoa Lord (Oh Lord)
Whoa Lord (Oh Lord)
