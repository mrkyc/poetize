I feel a change in the weather
I feel a change in me
The days are getting shorter
And the birds begin to leave
Even me, yes, yes, y'all
Who's been so long alone
I'm headed home
Headed home
The nights are getting colder now
And the air is getting crisp
I first tasted the universe
On a night like this
A box of wine, an alibi
And the hunger in her eyes
In the place where the tree of good and evil
Still resides
Still resides

Homecoming
Homecoming, homecoming

She said "show me what you've got, babe
I'm not like other girls,"
Just give me your bad self
And a place for us to make a stand and I can move the world
Lift the valley from the floor, honey
Little town into the sky
They'll say that it's a miracle
And you'll know damn well they're right
Damn well they're right

Homecoming, (Don't go away now)
Homecoming, homecoming, (Don't go away now)
Homecoming, (Don't go away now)
Homecoming, homecoming, (Don't go away now)

(Hey now)
When the oracle spoke to me
She was like a roadside song, (Don't go away now)
Do unto others as you would have them do
Even if in turn they do you wrong, (Hey now)
This town right here's my everything
And though I be torn away, (Don't go away now)
It had my heart, it has my heart
Be still, my heart, my heart will stay, (Hey now)
My heart will stay
My heart will stay, (Don't go away now)

Get just a little bit higher
Get a little tongue-tied
Gonna try to find whatever ever made time
That kind of immemorial
That time before the fall, yeah
That time before the autumn
Really turned the corner
Drive east of Eden
Till we'd start to feel the west
We were never far from nowhere
You could see it from the edge of town
Honey, baby, wonder how it'd feel now
Somehow I can't believe
That it could feel like before, but
The air is getting colder now
The nights are getting crisp
I first tasted the universe
On a night like this
An alibi, a box of wine
And the hunger in your eyes
In the place where
The tree of good and evil still resides

Homecoming
Homecoming, homecoming, (Homecoming)
Homecoming, ooooh
Homecoming, homecoming, (Homecoming)
Homecoming, ooooh
Homecoming, homecoming, (Don't go away now)
Homecoming, (Don't go away now)
Homecoming, homecoming
Homecoming, homecoming, (Don't go away now)
Homecoming, (Don't go away now)
