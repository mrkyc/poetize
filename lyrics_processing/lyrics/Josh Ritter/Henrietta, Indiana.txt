Henrietta, Indiana mill town
Locked the factory down and shut it up tight
My daddy and my brother and sixteen-hundred others
Lost everything they had in the night
Daddy got a taste for the hard stuff
Henrietta, Indiana was dry
We'd ride out to Putney, he'd tell me he loved me
The drive home was always so quiet

He had a devil in his eye, eye
Like a thorn in the paw
Disregard for the law
Disappointment to the Lord on high

My brother practiced preaching in the basement
Perspiration on his face 'til I knew
That something was missing, his spirit was willing
He could not believe it was true
"Blessed be the poor," he said
"Your treasure is on high."
All of Henrietta, Indiana heard me "Hallelujah!"
When I finally saw the devil in his eyes
You might also like
Oh, the devil in his eye, eye
Like a thorn in the paw
Disregard for the law
Disappointment to the Lord on high

I was coming home late
From a midnight to eight
The radio said they'd ID'd the plates
Left three men dead
Made their escape
"By now," said the sheriff
"They'll be in the next state."
"Will we be able to catch them?"
"Can they bring the dogs in?"
"Can they call up the Bureau?"
"Do they have next-of-kin?"
Cameras came to my door
I opened it wide
They thought I was crying
It was something in my eye, eye, eye
Eye, eye, eye, oh

At night I leave a bottle on the table
The Bible open to the Sermon on the Mount
Blessed be the poor of Henrietta, Indiana
But happy are the ones that get out
I think I'll drive over to Putney
The store'll be open 'til twelve
The empty parking lot, the lights, the lonely kid, the register
I see it all clear as a bell
I got a devil in my eye, eye
Like a thorn in the paw
Disregard for the law
Disappointment to the Lord on high
Eye, eye
Like a thorn in the paw
Disregard for the law
