I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies (Maybach Music)
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams (May-may-may)
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair (May-may-may)

And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
You might also like
Silver Rolls Royce cigarette smokes in it
New fur rug now my dirty boots in 'em
Flowin' in the pocket like I'm enrollin' in a college (Woo)
Mean as a dean, triple beam well polished (Woo)
She wanna watch Scandal, I wanna count a handful
Dead Presidents sleep in the attic of the mansion (Hah)
All I heard was murder, think the house haunted
Super Bowl tickets they bitches and and Fed chargers
Label the racketeer, John Grisham with a pen (Woo)
Top three writer but number one at your event (Hah)
Mastermind unfolds like a true crime
Double M gold mind for the whole time (Woo)

My friends and I, we've cracked the code (Woo, Maybach Music)
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tiger's on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy (May-may-may)

(Oh, oh-oh)
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen
(Oh, oh-oh)
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
