Don't you think that it's boring how people talk?
Making smart with their words again, well I'm bored
(Well, I'm bored, well I'm bored, well I'm bored, well I'm bored)
Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasing a million things I want
(Things I want, things I want, things I want)
And I am only as young as the minute is, full of it
Getting pumped up from the little bright things I bought
(Things I bought, things I bought)
But I know they'll never own me (Yeah)

(Oh)
Yeah
(Oh)
Yeah

And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)

It looked alright in the pictures
Getting caught's half of the trip though, isn't it?
I fall apart, with all my heart
And you can watch from your window (Yeah)
You might also like
(Oh)
Yeah
(Oh)
Yeah

And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)

Pretty soon, I'll be getting on my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
But my head's filling up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again, when I'm known?
(When I'm known, when I'm known, when)
And my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them
Everything's cool when we're all in line, for the throne
But I know they'll never own me (Yeah)

Baby, be the class clown, I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (Yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)
(Oh)
Yeah
(Oh)
Yeah
(Oh)
Yeah
(Oh)
Yeah
