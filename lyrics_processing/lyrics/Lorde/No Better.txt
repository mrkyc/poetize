We roll in every summer when there's strength in our numbers
And your breath's hot and gross, but I kiss you like a lover
Legs stick to the seats of the car someone grew into
I forget the knowledge from the lessons that I went to
And Jamie picks fights, but they're weak and short-lived
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
And we roll in every summer like it's shameful to be underneath
The ceiling or a roof, try come out and steal our thunder

Now the days are getting cooler and the burning of our limbs
Doesn't happen quite as bad and the burn is just skin
Deep in the fantasies and dreams of the winter
Like the movies that we watched to pretend it wasn't winter
And everywhere we go, I can feel the subtle taste
Of the deeds outgrown and the welcome overstayed
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning
But you come over at night and we practise all the breathing

Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

I'll pull the trig if I want to
I'll pull the trick and it comes true
I'm chewing gum and it's killin' you
We're gettin' dead and it's the right way to do it
I see you happy in the front seat
I see you with all of your front teeth
You're allergic, but you never said
We're gettin' dead and it's the right way

Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
