A couple rebel Top Gun pilots
Flyin' with nowhere to be, ooh-ooh
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally

Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome, right?
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
See me rollin', showin' someone else love
Dancin' with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right?

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

I wanna feel the light
Pushing our limits, unbuckled for the ride, mm
We're way too far from home
Let's be honest with ourselves
We're way too high to drive
So let's take on the night (Mm)
Lift our lighters in the air, hopin'
Finally, we're growin' and we're free

I checked your girl at the door
I sent your friend to the store
It's only me and you, finally us two
And I don't regret drinkin' this liquor
Makin' you listen
Yeah, I know you don't know me well
My girl's at the door and I left my pretense at home
And it ain't no goin' back (Goin' back)

Walk, never fall, but we still run
So pour up, pour up another one
I know, I know we on to somethin'
We got, we got a loaded gun, yeah
Go and shoot me that look in your eyes
And you're here, I'm yours, you're mine
Find each other when we're losin' our minds
Then we take it all off
You're a runaway train, yeah
And you got me so faded
And I don't wanna chase it, no
You know I think you're awesome, right?
