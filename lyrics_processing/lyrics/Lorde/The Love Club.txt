I'm in a clique, but I want out
It's not the same as when I was punched
In the old days, there was enough
The card games and knees with the bitter salt of blood
I was in, but I want out
My mother's love is choking me
I'm sick of words that hang above my head:
"What about the kid?" It's time the kid got free

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

I joined the club and it's all on
There are fights for being my best friend
And the girls get their claws out
There's somethin' about hanging out with the wicked kids
Take the pill, make it too real
The other day I forgot my old address
I'm sittin' pretty on the throne
There's nothing more I want, except to be alone
You might also like
Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

(For the love club)
(For the love club)
(For the love club)

Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
So drop your chin and take yourself back home
And roll out your maps and papers
Find out your hiding places again
The only problem that I got with the club
Is how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up
When you're a member, go on your great adventure again
And we'll be waiting at the end

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club
(For the love club)
(For the love club)
(For the love club)
(For the love club)
