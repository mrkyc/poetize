I don't recall
But there were kids involved
With guns and sharpened little knives
A few lost their lives
The things I'll remember
When I'm trying to forget
Are the things I'll keep close to my chest

The bone sticking through skin
Back and forth and back again
Give me a sign that everything is alright
Or better yet I'll forget
And pretend this never happened
You keep me warm and you comfort me
And you tell me to breathe
And then you ask the question

"Close your eyes and count to three
Then tell me what you see
I'll tell you what I know
And all the right ways to go
You see, the first step is to breathe
Not just to scream and leave
It's something we all have
But at times I know it's so hard to see"
You might also like
"The bone sticking through skin
Back and forth and back again
Is not there, there is no tear in the skin
Just breathe, I swear it never happened
I'll keep you warm and I'll comfort you
I'll tell you everything to do
And then I'll ask the question"

You know what
I'm done
Do you want to know my name
Or the god I take
Or how I pace when I'm all alone
Or stare out the window when I'm on the phone
Why am I always laughing

The bone sticking through skin
Back and forth and back again
Give me a sign that everything is alright
Or better yet I'll forget
And pretend this never happened
You keep me warm and you comfort me
And you tell me to breathe
And then you'll ask the question
"Am I getting through to you?"
And then you'll ask the question
"What do these mountains mean to you?"
And then you'll ask the question
"Am I getting through to you?"
And then you'll ask the question
