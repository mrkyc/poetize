Just when you thought that things have changed
Just when you thought your demons have gone away
It starts to rain it starts to beat down
My dog's digging in my bathtub
He's trying to escape the sound

It's me and him
It's him and I
We couldn't escape this if we tried
It's me and him
It's him and I
We couldn't escape this if we tried
But oh god I know

St. John is in the bathroom crying
St. John is in the bathroom crying
He is your friend
He just doesn't want to see you dead yet
St. John is in the bathroom crying
St. John is in the bathroom crying
He is your friend
He just doesn't want to see you dead yet
You might also like
Now God this feels so serious
God this feels so permanent
Every star in the sky
Is another that loved you
And the sky is white
And the sky is bright

It's me and him
It's him and I
We couldn't escape this if we tried
It's me and him
It's him and I
We couldn't escape this if we tried

St. John is in the bathroom crying
St. John is in the bathroom crying
He is your friend
He just doesn't want to see you dead yet
St. John is in the bathroom crying
St. John is in the bathroom crying
He is your friend
He just doesn't want to see you dead yet
Because the moon never really liked you
And the stars they said the same
The one you love the most
Would be the first one to go away
But oh god I know
Oh god I know

St. John is in the bathroom crying
He is your friend
He just doesn't want to see you dead yet
St. John is in the bathroom crying
St. John is in the bathroom crying
He is your friend
He just doesn't want to see you dead yet
