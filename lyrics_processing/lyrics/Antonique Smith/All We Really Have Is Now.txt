Do I drive you crazy with my one word answers?
Do I test your patience with my stubborn silence?
Do you really wanna know what's on my mind?
Well here I go again, spoiling paradise
And I'm so caught up, making sure you stay forever
That I forgot to love the time we spent together

I just wanna breathe in, stop second guessing
Look at your smile and take it in
Try to relax and live in the moment
It's all that we've got to believe in
The future's just a promise that may change with the weather
The past is just a photo book, still I'm chasing forever
Why do I keep searching for something I've already found?
All we really have is now
All we really have is now

And it's overcast with a chance of sunshine
Try to make it last while I know you're still mine
And I'm scared to show this fragile feeling that we live on
With all my frustrations and high expectations, just take it as it comes
You might also likeWhat I've got with you is as good as it gets
And I don't wanna look back at missed chances and regrets

I just wanna breathe in, stop second guessing
Look at your smile and take it in
Try to relax and live in the moment
It's all that we've got to believe in
The future's just a promise that may change with the weather
The past is just a photo book, still I'm chasing forever
Why do I keep searching for something I've already found?
All we really have is now

And I don't wanna take this for granted
Treasure the seeds that we've planted
You're all that I ever wanted, baby
I'm gonna stop bringing rain clouds
Appreciate all that I have now
In the big picture all that counts is that I'm with you
Don't ever take it away

Just wanna breathe in, stop second guessing
Look at your smile and take it in
Try to relax and live in the moment
It's all that we can believe in
The future's is a promise, never mind the weather
'Cause through the storm and rain we will be together
There's not point in searching for something I've already found
All we really have is now
All we really have is now
