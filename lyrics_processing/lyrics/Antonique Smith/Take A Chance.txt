I'm not easy to fool
I'm not easy to fall
You can give me everything
Or give me nothing at all
There are many things
That are not accounted for
But I overlook those feelings
So that I can get to your...

True intentions with my heart
For the best is yet to come
And I'm unconventional, yeah
And the circumstances aren't clear
But I know what we have is rare
So let's explore 'cause I...

Wanna fall in love
Wanna fall in love, I do
Wanna know how it feels
To share my world with you
Wanna fall in love
Wanna fall in love, it's true
Let go of my fears
And take a chance with you
You might also like
I know so many things
And so many things, I don't
But with you I wanna be
In a state of shock and awe
There are many times
When I wanna risk it all
Throw my caution to the wind
And let my heart soar
Throw my caution to the wind
And let my heart soar
But I overlook those feelings
So that I can get to your...

True intentions with my heart
For the best is yet to come
And I'm unconventional, yeah
And the circumstances aren't clear
But I know what we got is rare
So let's explore 'cause I...
