High, high, high, high
High, high, high, higher
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, higher

Feeling like you're telling me you wanna stay
What is it that makes you wanna go
As we're getting close, I feel you hesitate
Say "yes," and then you tell me "no"
Is it that you think you're making a mistake?
Like you might be losing your freedom
Is that why you're steady pushing me away?
This is what I wanna let you know

Don't you worry
I'm not trying to change you
I won't chase you
I'm only trying to elevate you
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, higher
If you let your guard down
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, higher
So let your guard down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
You might also like
Listen to me telling you that I'm the one
Hear me saying this is right for us
I just wanna know where you're coming from
Can you tell me that this isn't love?
Is it that you think you're making a mistake?
Like you might be losing your freedom
Showed you, you don't ever have to be afraid
This is what I wanna let you know

Don't you worry
I'm not trying to change you
I won't chase you
I'm only trying to elevate you
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, higher
If you let your guard down
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, higher
So let your guard down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

I told you, you can trust me
You never have to doubt me
All you gotta do is let it down
Don't you worry
I'm not trying to change you
I won't chase you
I'm only trying to elevate you
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, higher
If you let your guard down
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, higher
So let your guard down, down, down, down
