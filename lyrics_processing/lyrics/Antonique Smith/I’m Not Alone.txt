Maybe I fall too fast
Maybe I dream too much
Maybe I gave my everything
When maybe I shouldn't have
Maybe I try too hard
Maybe I go too far
As long as I'm headed for the moon
I'll catch a ride on a shooting star

Not a moment too soon
Not a minute too late
Maybe I've made my mistakes
But it's perfectly okay

Cause I'm not alone
I'm not the only one who knows
You've gotta crash and burn
To live and learn
With arms open wide eyes closed
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
You've gotta crash and burn
To live and learn
With arms open wide eyes closed
You might also like
I know that I'm different
I know that I'm not too bad
I want to look back and be able to say
I gave it all I had
I know what I want to do
But I don't know if I'm able to
It's a chance that I'm willing to take
Cause nothing's certain anyway

Not a moment too soon
Not a minute too late
I'm gonna make my mistakes
But its perfectly okay

Cause I'm not alone
I'm not the only one who knows
You've gotta crash and burn
To live and learn
With arms open wide eyes closed
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
You've gotta crash and burn
To live and learn
With arms open wide eyes closed
Gonna live my life
With my arms open wide
Take a leap of faith
As I shut my eyes
I'm not alone alone
No I'm not alone alone

Cause I'm not alone
I'm not the only one who knows
You've gotta crash and burn
To live and learn
With arms open wide eyes closed
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
You've gotta crash and burn
To live and learn
With arms open wide eyes closed

Gonna live my life
With my arms open wide
Take a leap of faith
As I shut my eyes
I'm not alone alone
No I'm not alone
