Is consuming me
Since you waging war
Then the hell with peace
Hold up wait a minute (woo woo)
Wait a minute (woo woo)
Hold up wait a minute (woo woo)
Wait a minute (woo woo)
See this disrespect boy
Ain't for me
All you do is take
Honey, it ain't free
Hold up wait a minute (woo woo)
Hold up wait a minute (woo woo)
Wait a minute (woo woo)
I deserve so much more
Than what you're giving to me
I don't know how I let my feelings
Make a fool out of me
But as I open my eyes
I see that you must be blind
Because somebody else like me
Won't be so easy to find

My names on both receipts

Treat you like a king
I buy my own red bottoms
You still ain't bought my ring

Someone who breaks all his toys

But life ain't playschool of me
Time to go, time to go, yeah go
