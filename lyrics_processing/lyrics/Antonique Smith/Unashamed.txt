If I changed my mind
If I changed my faith
Every time a stop light signaled
Each time I made mistakes
I don't think that I
Would be where I am today
I live my life without regrets
What you see is
What you see is
What you see is what you get
And I'm

Unashamed of the life I lead
Unashamed of the strength on my knees
Of choices I've made
Of the love that I've saved
Of the things I've done
My belief in the One
Unashamed of the words of my friends
I know who they are
Make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star
On my sleeve I wear my heart
Unashamed

Adding up my life, it totals all my dreams
I'm counting all my blessings
And the gifts I have received
Still there's always someone
Something to overcome
Took all my life to understand
That I am what I am, who I am
Unashamed

Unashamed of the life I lead
Unashamed of the strength on my knees
Of choices I've made
Of the love that I've saved
Of the things I've done
My belief in the One
Unashamed of the words of my friends
I know who they are
Make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star
On my sleeve I wear my heart
Unashamed

Do you
Do you want to know how it goes?
Do you want to control how I feel?
Do you want to stay in my life?
Then listen here, and listen good
You gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it right
Unashamed
Unashamed of the life I lead
Unashamed of the strength on my knees
Of choices I've made
Of the love that I've saved
Of the things I've done
My belief in the One
Unashamed of the words of my friends
I know who they are
Make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star
On my sleeve, I wear my heart
Unashamed
Unashamed of the life I lead (Unashamed)
Unashamed of the strength on my knees (yeah)
Of choices I've made
Of the love that I've saved
Of the things I've done
My belief in the One
Unashamed of the words of my friends (I know who they are)
I know who they are
Make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star
On my sleeve, I wear my heart

Unashamed
