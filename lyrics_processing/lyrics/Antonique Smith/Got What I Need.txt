No stress 'cause you're soothing me
Don't even know what you do to me

Ain't about what you own
'Cause what you got it tops it all
I'm priceless, but you paid it all
And that's why, baby
Love you, need you, want you, yeah, yeah

'Cause you got what I need
Ain't got a lot of money
But you know what I believe
