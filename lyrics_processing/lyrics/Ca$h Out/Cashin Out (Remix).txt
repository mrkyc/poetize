Big diamonds, them bitches the size of golf balls

Ha, and my followers say, "Did you see what Rihanna tweet you?"
No, she say she riding with Keisha, smoking on Keisha

Damn, L.A. Reid signed me cause it's epic how I talk

Thirty-six Os so I'm ridin' 'round with that Nina
Ridin' with a ho named Keisha, smokin' on Keisha
My diamonds talk for me, they say, "Hi, can I met you?"

Got a condo around my neck girl, I'm cashing out

Foreign cars in my garage, all these bad bitches I beat
Oops, is that your girl? She said her name was Nina
Oops, ridin' 'round, gettin' head from a girl named Nina
Oops, I'm sorry, but I'm on my Ike and Tina (Ike and Tina!)

Got a indoor court, outdoor court, indoor pool, outdoor pool
