Now here I go, hope I don't break down
I won't take anythin', I don't need anythin'
Don't want to exist, I can't persist
Please stop before I do it again

Just talk about nothin'
Let's talk about nothin'
Let's talk about no one
Please talk about no one, someone, anyone

You and me have a disease
You affect me, you infect me
I'm afflicted, you're addicted
You and me, you and me

I'm on the edge, get against the wall
I'm so distracted, I love to strike you
Here's my confession, you learned your lesson
Stop me before I do it again

You and me have a disease
You affect me, you infect me
I'm afflicted, you're addicted
You and me, you and me

You're clear as a heavy lead curtain
Wanna drill you like an ocean
We can work it out, I've been runnin' out
Now I'm runnin' out, don't be mad about it, baby

You and me have a disease
I wanna untie you, crucify you
(You affect me, you infect me)
Kneel before you, revile your body
(I'm afflicted, you're addicted)
You and me were made in heaven
(You and me have a disease)
I wanna take you, I wanna break you
(You affect me, you infect me)
Supplicate you with thorny roses
(I'm afflicted, you're addicted)
You and me are incurable
(You and me have a disease)
I wanna bathe you in holy water
(You affect me, you infect me)
I wanna kill you upon the altar
(I'm afflicted, you're addicted)
