One of those th- the singer moved to Switzerland
To- to live with his girlfriend
You're really cool
I'd move to Switzerland for you, if you wanted
Oh! There's another song we could listen to
Okay, I love you

I'm gonna write you a song
About every little thing that I did wrong
And how you still love me
Regardless of what I've done
Don't you dare leave me
And break my hopeless heart
I won't ever let you fall apart

Let's take a short cut
To the castle in the clouds
I would love to kiss you
Only if I was allowed
Maybe this time next year
Everything will all work out
Let's take a short cut to the castle
You might also like
So I'm writing this song
'Cause you wrote one for me
That made me happy, baby
Haven't felt this happy in awhile
You're so wonderful and lilac
I hope I never fall in love
With anyone else

Let's take a short cut
To the castle in the clouds
I would love to kiss you
If I only was allowed
Maybe this time next year
Everything will all work out
Let's take a short cut to the castle

Oh, I love you so much
I'm walking back now
And I've been at the party for about three hours
I've had lots of vodka
I probably had a little bit too much, to be fair
I- I don't know how much, I can't remember
Uhm, but, what I know- What I can remember is that I love you
I can't remember to pay for your service
Your name is so sweet, hot
Let's take a short cut
To the castle in the clouds
I would love to kiss you
If I only was allowed
Maybe this time next year
Everything will all work out
