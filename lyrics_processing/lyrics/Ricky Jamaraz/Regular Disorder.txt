Are you ready? Woo

Rainy days turn into hazy nights
All sofa surfing and teenage frights (Oh-oh)
All parents backyards and unmarked cop cars tonight...
And every other night!

And there you lie
Dead in a lay-by
I got your texts
Said i should come by
Three in the morning
I hear you calling tonight...
And every other night!

And now you're crying in the corner
A case of regular disorder
Your parents getting what they ordered
A case of regular disorder
And now you're crying in the corner
A case of regular disorder
Your parents getting what they ordered
A case of regular disorder, woah-oh oh-oh-oh
You might also like
And there you are
How you lied to your mother
Your parents are worried
And you won't listen to your brother oh

And all the fall outs
And how we fall out
And all the fall outs
And how we fall out!
