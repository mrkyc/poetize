Yo, on the lowest of keys I think I'm french
Wait, what?
'Cause Eiffel for you
Ha ha
Bonjour, am I right?
Oh, Ricky Jamaraz, you're such a silly prankster gangster, aren't you?
Now tell me, how do you balance the loveableness with the relatability, y'know?
Like, constantly, you're so cool!

In my room I am happy, in my room I am sad
In my room I do good things, in my room I do bad
If you don't want me at all and you want me to go
I can go to my room and be all alone
In my room I get lonely, I get lonely pretty fast
And I think I need some new friends to forget about the past
I'll keep you here forever if I like you enough
Please do not escape, please don't touch my stuff

Wooh, i'm going a bit silly goofy
AAH!

In my room, in my room, in my room
(I can't stop, can't stop now)
In my room, in my room, in my ro-oom
(I can't stop, can't stop now)

Hey, you're pretty neat
Now listen, I know I've got this insanely attractive
Panic attack aesthetic I've got going on
But please, it's only 4am, the night is young
Keep your hands off me
Wow, yeah I'm really liking this-
Now listen mate, don't talk during the instrumentals, it ruins it
Oh, sorry my bad, I'm new to this, I'm new to this

AAH!!
In my room, in my room, in my room
(I can't stop, can't stop now)
In my room, in my room, in my ro-oom
(I can't stop, can't stop now)

Trying, trying, what's the point in trying?
Trying, trying, what's the point in trying?
Trying, trying, what's the point in trying?
Trying, I'm trying
I love you so much (in my room, in my room)
And I don't want you to go so alone (in my room)
I know that you're you're scared (in my room, in my room)
