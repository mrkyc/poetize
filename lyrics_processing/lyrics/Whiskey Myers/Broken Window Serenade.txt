That's what I brought to you
I saw you through a broken window
With a different point of view
You had signs of depression
From a long line of sin
And your face tells a story
'Bout the places you have been
I love you so
I thought you should know
And that muddy water's flowin'
As you take my hand
Past the creek down by the holler
Through your daddy's land
I could buy you a diamond
But I cannot change the world
'Cuz I ain't got no money
You'll never be my girl no no
I thought you should know
You was gonna be a singer
And a big movie star
But you can't catch no breaks baby
And Hollywood is hard
Now you work down at the Timeout
Off 155
And you're dancing for your dollar
Just tryin' to stay alive
It hurts me so
I thought you should kno
W
You feed your addiction
With your crystal meth
And I plead for your life
As it takes you to your death
You make your deal with the devil
As your looks begin to fade
I saw you laughin' through the tears
As you slowly slipped away
I watched you go
I thought you should know
Yeah I watched you go
I thought you should know

As they lay you in the grave
And I can barely recognize you
In your fragile state
No more signs of depression
From a long time ago
I throw in a pretty flower
As they slowly laid you low
It was a rose
I thought you should know
Yeah it was a rose
I thought you should know
A couple of pretty flowers
That's what I brought to you
I saw you through a broken window
