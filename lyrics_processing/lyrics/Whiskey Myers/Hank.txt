Ain't it funny how your life can change with a song
That's the first time I ever heard "A Country Boy Can Survive"
Now I got a guitar and a little band
I live hard, I live fast, just like a man
'Cause you can't just play it, boy it's got to be part of your life
Guess I'm finally whiskey bent now, and hell bound
I've been low but I ain't ever been this far down
I need a back road somewhere deep in the pines
Burning my wheels until the sun shines
'Cause I'm back at the bottom and I ain't got nothing to lose
Yeah I pray to the Lord, the struggle is strong
But I'll never get out this world alive
Oh, Hank, won't you help me 'cause I'm lowdown singing the blues
Almost OD'd in Denver just the other night
I was high in the Rockies on a 13 hour flight
Trying to get home to my country state of mind
Now these blues they come and go just like the rain
I need a little more help to ease the pain
Mr. Weatherman won't you please push these clouds away
Leave me alone 'cause I'm singing all damn night
There's a tear in my beer, I guess I finally know why
