Well, the world gon' turn, and the sun gon' rise
The river gonna flow, oh, but the creek gone dry
It's hell getting old, when it's hot in the shade
I hate to go to work, oh, but I gots to get paid

And when the day's done, I'ma bring it home
Pour up some wine and put an old-time record on
Workin' on love 'til the break of dawn
Daddy swings a hammer
To the rhythm of an old song
(Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah)

Well, my boat don't run and the fish don't bite
But, I'll be coming home, girl, to you Sunday night
Baby's in the kitchen, oh, in a black bandana
She said, "Some things need fixin'"
So, it's time to swing the hammer

There's a full moon in the woods tonight
And I'll be at home just puttin' in overtime
Workin' on love 'til the break of dawn
Daddy swings a hammer
To the rhythm of an old song (Oh, yeah)
Yeah, the rhythm of an old song (Yeah)

My little mama knows I'm a hardworking man
She lets me swing the hammer any time that I can (Oh, yeah)
She got me workin' 'round the clock on them sweet honey-do's
Just nailing down a beat to the rhythm and blues

And when it's all over, I'ma start again
Feelin' your rhythm, as an old-time vinyl spins
Working on love 'til the break of dawn
Daddy swings the hammer to the rhythm of an old song
Yeah, the rhythm of an old song
