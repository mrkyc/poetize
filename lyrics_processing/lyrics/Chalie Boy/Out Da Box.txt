Fuck it, if ya shoes laced up, I knock ya out ya socks (Down in Houston right now, ya know what I'm sayin'? It's southern hospitality, haha)
(Out the box) Knock 'em out the box
Fuck it, if ya shoes laced up, I knock ya out ya socks (Hey, hey, hey)

Ayo, I'm chillin' down in Houston, kinda tempted by the lean
One thing I learned 'bout life is it's never what it seems
I be clever any weather, givin' letters to you fiends, bitch
Tailored by my seamstress, she all up on my penis
Shouts to Chalie Boy, Killa Kyle, 
And to the promoters who brought  to fix my munchies
Mad I'm gettin' money now and livin' like a young G
My flow is wild though: Crocodile Dundee
See the way I'm killin' 'em, bitch from the Caribbean
They hear me spittin' like, "Mac is goin' in again"
Reach the world, different ends, travel round the globe
Every time I hit the stage, hoes be grabbin' on my clothes
He look just like me? Well, he has to be a clone
Rookies gettin' killed  now we're pro
Hands up, we about to rock
The flow hittin' though, knock ya ass out the box, like

Everybody got a vice, true, no discussin'
My addiction, I get a rush outta  concussions
I really get a kick outta slippin' haters in a coma
So, play if you wanna, I do more than lay the truth on ya
Need proof  shark tooth
I unloose 'til they for a truce
Ya bark, oof, bitch, I bite
The noose tighten like Zeus, zappin', poof, ya gone
 ain't nothin' left but shoes
What happened? Bit off more than you could chew?
Yeah, I thought so
Vanity, sittin'  things that you fought for
I got 'em, coach, underestimate me 'cause I talk slow
I threw him three  for good measure, he caught four
Spartacus, God of the arena, do not attack, son
Just sit quiet 'cause they don't want none of this action
If you see a character, then slap 'em
Bitch, I surprise you when I  your Marvel vs. Capcom
(Out the box) Knock 'em out the box
Fuck it, if ya shoes laced up, I knock ya out ya socks
(Out the box) Knock 'em out the box
Fuck it, if ya shoes laced up, I knock ya out ya socks

(Out the box) Knock 'em out the box (Uh)
Fuck it, if ya shoes laced up, I knock ya out ya socks (Yeah, uh)

Catch me if you can, I'm at a different pace
I'm always ten steps ahead in a different race
Forget the radio, Ryno's a big-timer
I'm underground, call me a Chilean miner
No sunshine, no oxygen
I knock ya out ya socks if you try to box me in
Ain't no boxin' him, it's the One Hitter Quitter
I hit you once, then you sittin' on your shitter
Big nasty, the head honcho
I'm the Lone Star Ranger to you Tontos
Y'all some sidekicks, get your waves right
I got more swag than these niggas on they date night, haha
You know I'm crazy though
6'5", big and black with a crazy flow
H-Town made him, yeah, I'm so amazin'
I knock ya out ya socks, you chillin' on the pavement
Yes (Out the box), knock 'em out the box
