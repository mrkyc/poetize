This For Them Fords, Oldsmobiles, Buicks, and them Chevys
Cadillacs 24 Inches High Slidin On Pirellis
Candy coated gloss hair bands low, It scrape tha belly
Beat In tha trunk turnin buildins Into Confetti
Country grammer like Nelly
We speak with a drawl
But slower something like in our slabs we creep and we crawl
Hit a button and you know the roof and screens fall
Jammin Screwed Up Tela, Though We Ain't Too Tired To Ball Roof be candy-coated Caprice be flippin' like I'm the law
See that shirt On that bop got enough knock to pop It off
Old head cats tellin me, "Chalie you need to knock it off!"
I just did, look again see i'm bout to pop the bra
Im from them dirty third coast where we keepin' it raw
Yo slab's up against ours, you think that you beatin Us? Naw
Re-pimp yo ride cause slabs down in da south be nasty y'all Think that its sumthin just wait till we pull out them classic cars Candy paint drip like it was fresh out of molasses jars
Futuristic, got Customization, Its way past the stars, mayne!

Ain't no need in askin' boy, yes I'm a winner
Bourbon on 24s wit VVS in the spinner
Leather seats and my name in diamonds rest in the center

Neva a beginner, I'm an iced-out champ
Lift the bracelet on my wrist and catch an iced-out cramp

Cause its powered by an iced-out amp

Platinum princess cuts, or invisible sets
