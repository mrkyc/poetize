Eh, Eh, Ehh
Ouu, Yeahh
Hope you understand 
Take me out 'em but I still remain
24/7 I'm about my grind, Hit it tik-tik-tik and I'm about my time
Try to play and do away with it, I'mma make a motherfucka pop
At the drop of a dime, and it sound like, "Bow!"
Steppin' in the room for the cash, Try to Box
Sweep a nigga like a broom 'n I dash, Street fighta'
Please understand, use an underhand 
And I'mma make it feel like a Sonic Boom on ya ass
Baboon on a mans, I pounce on dough 
Crackin' up the Vo's or the bines on fo' 
Crang' in the bang , In the 9's  I'm cold
'Cause the candy paint hurtin', if he ounce on the hoe 
Talk down to my fo's , Fuck it matto' 
If it ain't on  my bread, Why the fuck do it matter?
Not of a chump, if he get close to bump 
But other than that, I keep climbin' the ladda'
Pockets stay fatta', Outta my grind
And givin' a damn about a hata', Wanna talk down
I'mma make me a while, can't grind two times 
Just to whine, so a hata' ass can't walk 'round
Come to my block, Be where I be
Never know what I know if you don't see what I see
I'm the King, Never think you can overthrow me
Put it down, I'mma hard worker
Less Ob, yeahh

I was born a G, that's what I'mma be 'til I'm dead
Take me out 'em, But I keep them streets in my head

Sometimes you win, Sometimes you lose
Sometimes you take shots that'll leave you bruised
Sometimes you just think, Sometimes you just do
Sometimes you need to stop, Sometimes you need to move
Time to be hot, Time to be cool
Time to get gangsta', time to groove
Time to speed shit up, Finna turn the screw
Turn the play, and the time to make a point to be proved
From  sundown to sun-up, I'm on the grind
Finna come up, I don't play around with stunnas
Get back or get plaqued if you run up, I smoke lightweights like ganja
And my strap clappin' like thunda', The impact
Hit just like a 2-ton truck, Leavin' ya body froze up like a tundra
Toppin' , I don't need to wonder
If you fuck around with my funds, bruh, I'll make ya ass roll like a 24" fo' sho'
No, this tip drill ain't no fun so',  What the hood created in me
Please believe, I'll let it know
Hater sent a sender, It'll get ate 
This skrap'll get skraight, Try to cross my weight
Guess we'll thunda' , The codes of the G
Kept one hunid with me, Catch ya bumpin' ya beak
And I'm reconstructin' with yead , Predators prey upon the weak
Which one of you it  confronted on the street?, Tell me
From my toes to my shoulders, Knees to my head
I was born a G, that's what I'mma be 'til I'm dead
Take me out 'em, But I keep them streets in my head
I was born a G, that's what I'mma be 'til I'm dead
From my toes to my shoulders, Knees to my head
I was born a G, that's what I'mma be until I'm dead
Take me out 'em, But I keep them streets in my head
I was born a G, that's what I'mma be 'til I'm dead
Get a dolla', Now double the dolla'
When I say a dolla', I mean 5 figures
That ain't shit for ni--as in my clique, 'Cuh we hustle hard and survive ni--as
Haters fall off, But they changin' seasons 
While we stay fresh and thrive ni--a, Just come to a show
See how a ni--a blow, When those lipsingin' bitches go live ni--a
Move to the side, When I be glidin' by
'Cause I be all about my bi'dness hoe, Hollow tips'll make a ni--a lose weight
And I ain't talkin' bout physical fitness hoe, Make a note to murder 'Ero 
That's the man above as my witness hoe, What the clique'll  smoke
If you ass get left broke, Go tell them ni--as that I did this hoe
Bleed the blocks, Not with the rocks
I'mma bleed what the candy paints , Said that's a quote from Z-ro
Take it from me tho' , Fuck around get hit by a damn torpedo outta my submarine
Or the summer scene, With the double beam
Colored Tangerine, No discuss
See I'm about to bust, in every callin'  girl
Like an Evangeline, Watch how you be handling me
Because I'm known for dismantling, My conflict is crucial When I'm agin'   piss
So it's best for you, "Beware the scene"
I only knew the Tia on the screen, DOA is such a shameful thing
Bang with me and I'mma swang and swing
Chalie Boy, That name is still claimin' King
From my toes to my shoulders, Knees to my head
I was born a G, that's what I'mma be 'til I'm dead
Take me out 'em, But I keep them streets in my head
I was born a G, that's what I'mma be 'til I'm dead
From my toes to my shoulders, Knees to my head
I was born a G, that's what I'mma be until I'm dead
Take me out 'em, But I keep them streets in my head
