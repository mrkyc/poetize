I'll be waiting in the car
Don't forget the camera
If you wouldn't mind
Could you find my yellow shoes?
I think they're under the stairs
Fa la la la la fa la

Through the hills and country side
Waving at the passers-by
There's old Tom in a coat and tie
Looking every ounce the prince
His bike up against the fence
Fa la la la la fa la
Fa la la la la fa la

We drove to the sea
Where the water was green
And the clouds and the blue
Threw shadows on me and you
The shells that we found in the sand
The moment we held in our hands
You were making me laugh
It was easier then, when...
But then again

I'll be dozing over there
Cozy in my folding chair
Watching seabirds in the air
As they circle the sun
Sleepers they suffer no one
Fa la la la la fa la
Fa la la la la fa la

We drove to the sea
Where the water is green
And the clouds and the blue
Threw shadows on me and you
The shells that we found in the sand
The moment we held in our hands
You were making me smile
It was easier then, when...
But then again

All of the questions in my head
I'll make them read, put them to bed
All of the voices in my mind
Hart and unkind, leave them behind
Leave them behind
As we drove to the sea
Where the water was green
And the clouds and the blue
Threw shadows on me and you
The shells that we found in the sand
The moment we held in our hands
You were making me laugh
It was easier then, when...
But, but then again

I'll be waiting in the car
Don't forget the camera
If you wouldn't mind
Could you find my yellow shoes
I think they're under the stairs
