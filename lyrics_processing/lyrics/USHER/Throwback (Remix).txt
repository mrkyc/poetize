Real talk, Usher
Just Blaze, you know
Oh, oh ohh
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here with me
(You're gonna need me, need me one day)
And now that day's here, your man gotta shed tears, right?!
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)

You never miss a good thing 'til it leaves ya
And finally, I realize that I need ya
I want you back
Baby girl, I need you back
Gotta have you back, babe
Heartbroken when you left my world
Man, I wish I would've kept my girl
I love you
I don't know what I'm gon' do without my baby

It's drivin' me crazy (It's drivin' me crazy)
'Cause I'm missin' my baby (Missin' my baby)
I'm goin' out of my mind and I'm runnin' out of time
Oh, I just wish I could find you, girl, oh-oh
Said, I'm 'bout to go crazy ('Bout to go crazy)
'Cause I've been needin' you lately (Needin' you lately)
I'm goin' out of my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said 'em now

I would take back all my words

I didn't see it
I couldn't see what I was doin', babe (Oh)
See, baby girl, I was blind and I wish I could try
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)

But I need her and she told me I was gon' want her back
Should've believed her, now I'm wishin' I could throw me back
To that exact spot where we found L-O-V-E at
Lose some, then I lose again, when am I gonna win some?
(Gonna need me, need me one day)
I said a lot of things out of anger, but I meant some
(You're gonna want me back)
I brought a lot of things to the table besides income (Oh)
I just want things to go back to how they used to be
I was used to you and I thought you were used to me
Time is against me
You never miss something till it's gone
That's my word, ma, you convinced me
It might not happen, but I'm still hopin'
And my heart is broken, but the door is still open
Pillow still soakin', your boy still locing (Oh)
Dutch still lit and a bottle still open
And if I don't get another chance, it'll be hard to get focused
It's drivin' me crazy (It's drivin' me crazy)
'Cause I'm missin' my baby (I'm missin' my baby, yeah)
I'm goin' out of my mind, runnin' out of time
I just wish I could find you, girl, oh baby
Said, I'm 'bout to go crazy ('Bout to go crazy)
'Cause I've been needin' you lately (Needin' you lately)
The love of my life
But I wasn't lovin' you right, baby, yeah, yeah
