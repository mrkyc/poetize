I know you think I'm afraid
To take a chance
And go to the deep end
(Usher, baby)
Turn the lights on

These waters can get a little busy
But I got experience (Yeah)
Don't mind trekking through the storm
Long as I know that you're here with me, babe
Shedding all your innocence

I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my waist
But I promise, girl, I ain't afraid

It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Loving makes you so wet
Your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met, I knew that I
And I knew I was ready, baby, uh
To take that dive

Can't help it, no
I want you to feel me
Every little bit of me, baby
I don't need a life saver (Baby)
Baby, going deeper ain't gon' kill me
And I love the rush I get from it

I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my waist
But I promise, girl, I ain't afraid, oh no

It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Loving makes you so wet
Your legs, your thighs, uh
And ever since we first met, I knew that I
And I knew I was ready, baby, uh
To take that dive

I'll be inside when the tides are rolling, baby
You'll be my place to hide, all night
All night, babe
I'm not afraid to try
And ooh, I don't mind playing in the rain
And I was hoping that I get to take that dive
It's raining inside your bed
(It's raining and I don't mind if I get wet, baby, yeah)
No parts are dry (Oh)
Loving makes you so wet (So wet)
