I just wanna
I just wanna take my time, my time, my time with you
Oooh, oooh

We're here alone while the thunder is roaring
And the windows are blowing
'Cause it's storming and pouring tonight
I put my hand on your chest
I can feel your heart
And it's beating kinda fast, so is mine
In this moment of silence, you look me in the eyes
Nothing is verbalized, but so much is said
I need you so much
The more I'm away from you, the more of you I want
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
(I need you)

I want to hold you till I can't feel again
Until your soul lets me in

Tell me that you wanna make love
Tell me that you wanna really make love
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah
Baby, I'm a man that believes in what it is

We're going to a whole 'nother level
When we do it, it's so true
And it's so much more than sexual tonight
When we're connected, every touch, every kiss is perfected
It's like when we finally found what we been looking for
It gets better and better with time
This is deeper than love
The more of you I have, the more of you I want
Oooh, oooh
(Oh, I need you, baby)
Oooh, oooh

I want to hold you till I can't feel again
Until your soul lets me in

Tell me that you wanna make love
Tell me that you wanna really make love
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah

Oh baby, can we go deeper?
Deeper than the surface
Further than that
I want to hold you till I can't feel again
Until your soul lets me in

Tell me that you wanna make love
Tell me that you wanna really make love
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah
