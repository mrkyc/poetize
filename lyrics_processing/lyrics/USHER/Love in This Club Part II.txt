Queen B, yeah
I'm the king, y'all know that
She the queen, came right back
Listen to me
Yeah, yeah
Oh, remix

Now, baby girl, there ain't nothin' more that I can say
You know by now, I want it more than anything
If I walk away and just let you leave
You'll be stuck in my head like a melody
I know you want it (Yeah)
But I'm hesitatin' (Why?)
You must be crazy, I got a man, you got a lady
I know, we here together, so this must be somethin' special
'Cause you could be anywhere you wanted

But you decided to be here with me
No coincidence, it was meant to be
Don't be shy, come let your boy get in
So you can tell all of your friends
You was on the remix, like...

Ladies, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watchin', I ain't stoppin'
Baby, I don't give up
In this club, in this club
Ladies, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watchin'
Baby, I don't give up in this club

Baby, you know I'd be down
But we can't have all these people starin', standin' around
This right here is only for your eyes to see
But you gettin' carried away, sayin' we can do it wherever
The way you touchin' me like no other
I'ma make you feel insane
Tryin' your hardest to make me give in
But I'ma be down to give you whatchu wantin' if you keep it up
I strongly doubt this velvet rope would hold me up
And I don't want security rollin' up on us (I got you)
I'm not hesitatin', I just don't wanna rush
You could be anywhere you wanted
But you decided to be here with me
No coincidence, it was meant to be
I guess if I mess around and let you get in
You gon' tell all of your friends
You was on this remix, like...

In this club, in this club
Fellas, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up

They can keep watchin', I'm stoppin'
Baby, I don't give up
In this club, in this club
Ladies, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watchin'
Baby, I don't give up in this club

Ahem, shawty want a thug
It started with a hug
And the rest went like this
I gave her neck, a kissy-kiss
She gave my neck a kiss back
I said, we could do it like a stack
I mean, we could do it like a G
On the couch in V.I.P
Shawty, we could get it on
I'm like, "Shout out to the DJ for playin' this song"
Girl, we could act like two damn fools
And everybody think we doin' a dance move
Call me, so I can make it juicy for ya
Meet me in the bathroom and you could be my secret lover, girl
Haha, and it started with a hug
But now we makin' love in this club
And we not gonna stop just because
The people in the crowd are watchin' us
But we don't give a damn what they say
And this is the, the remix, baby
Come a little closer to Daddy, put it on you
Need you to know what happens here, stays here
And I'm ready and willin', almost got to go
Got you standin' at attention, keep it on the low
Ain't nobody watchin', don't worry, they can't see us
I know I got you hot, now let me in
You in the club or the car, wherever you are
Run and tell the DJ, run it back on replay

In this club, in this club
Fellas (Ladies), can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watchin', I ain't stoppin'
Baby, I don't give up
Now, run and tell all of your friends
You gotta hear this remix, like...

King and queen, y'all know

If we make love in this club
What would music be without Soundz?
