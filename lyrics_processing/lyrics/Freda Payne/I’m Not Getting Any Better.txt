I lost my sunshine in a cloudy sky
I threw forever away when I said goodbye
I went away hoping to find someone
Someone to give me peace of mind
But still, ever constant, ever true
Is the love and memory I have for you
Here it comes again...those memories...
Pounding and pounding inside my mind
Like a shadow, you dance through my mind
And disappear into lost time
I'm not getting any better
Time has hurt me more
Oh no
I'm not getting any better
My love is greater than before
I'm cursed with this need for you
Can't get over making plans for two
The pain your memory brings, I can't endure
I thought tomorrow would bring a cure
Can't live without you, you are my life
(You are my life, you are my life, can't live without you)
I'm not getting any better
Time has hurt me more (time has hurt me more)
You might also likeOh no (no no)
I'm not getting any better
My love is greater than before (greater than before)
I'm like a child who's lost from home
With no experience to face this world alone
I fall and stumble trying to regain
Those pleasures that once spoke your name
Can't live without you, you are my life
(You are my life, you are my life, can't live without you)
I'm lost in a sea of despair
I'm on a downhill journey going nowhere
I'm not strong enough to accept this change
Life seems so unreal, so different, so strange

I still need you...I still love you...
Can't live without you, you are my life
(You are my life, you are my life, can't live without you)
I'm not getting any better
Time has hurt me more
Oh no
I'm not getting any better
My love is greater than before
Your memory is all around me
You're in every passing face I see
I'm like a poet without rhyme
Like a clock that's run out of time
Can't live without you, you are my life
(You are my life, you are my life, can't live without you)
(I'm not getting any better
Oh no, no no no no no no
I'm not getting any better
Oh no, no no no no no no)
