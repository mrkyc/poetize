Hold up
Ho-hold up
Feel like everyday is my birthday
So show up

Everybody's blowing up my phone
(Up my phone)
But you already know I'm not at home
(I'm not at home)
I'm in the club in the worst way
So show up
Watch me go-go up

And every time the DJ play this song
I get hype, I get happy
And everybody snap me on their phone
Tag, just tag me
I'ma switch the play like an audible
Haters taking notes like an article
Quick to cut the bull like a matador
My whole crew lit
That's why you mad though

Play my birthday song

They all wanna buy me drinks for my birthday
Show love
Sh-show love
And I don't even drink but it's my birthday
Pour up
I'ma just pour up
Going OT we never quit
(Never Quit)
They don't hold a candle I'm too lit
(I'm too lit)
And if you feel like it's your birthday
Hands up
Let me see your hands up

And every time the DJ play this song
I get hype, I get happy
And everybody try to snap me on their phone
Tag, tag just me

Haters taking notes like an article
Quick to cut the bull like a matador
My whole crew lit
