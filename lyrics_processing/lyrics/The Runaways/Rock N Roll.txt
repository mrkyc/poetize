It's all right (woh!)
It's all right
It's all right
Jenny said when she was five years old
There's nothin' goin' down at all
Every time I turn on the radio
There's nothin' happenin' at all
Then one day she turned on that New York station
And couldn't believe what she heard at all
She started dancin' to that fine, fine music
Her life was saved by rock 'n' roll
Despite all the imputations
You could dance to that rock 'n' roll station
It was all right (it's all right)
It was all right (it's all right)
You know (it's all right)
It was all right (it's all right)
Jenny said when she was five years old
My parents will be the death of us all
Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars
Well, they just don't mean nothin' at all
Then one day she turned on that New York station
She couldn't believe what she heard at all
She started dancin' to that fine, fine music
Her life was saved by rock 'n' roll
Despite all the computations
You could dance to that rock 'n' roll station
