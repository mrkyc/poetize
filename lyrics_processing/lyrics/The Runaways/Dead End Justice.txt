I'm a blonde bombshell, and I wear it well
Your momma says you're goin' straight to hell
I'm sweet sixteen and a rebel queen
And I look real hot in my tight, blue jeans

Dead-end kids in the danger zone
All of you are drunk and stoned
Dead-end kids, you're not alone
You sleep on the streets when you're not at home

Long hot summers make you wanna fight
The roar of the city lasts all night
You like drugs, you like brew
You won't believe what I can do to you

Dead-end kids in the danger zone
All of you are drunk and stoned
Dead-end kids, you're not alone
You sleep in the streets when you're not at home

Got away clean with my fake ID
No more school or mommy for me
Stealin' cars, and breakin' hearts
Pills and thrills and actin' smart
You might also like
Dead-end kids in the danger zone
All of you are drunk and stoned
Dead-end kids, you're not alone
You sleep in the streets when you're not at home

In the naked city
Spaces ain't that pretty
As I was getting dusted
I happened to get busted
Oh, yes, I was arrested
Oh God, how I protested
They beat me with a board
It hurt just like a sword
They kicked me in the eye
My brain began to fry
This is like a movie
I know I'm gonna scream
All the pain that I feel
Makes me feel mean
It's so sad and crazy here
I think I'm gonna cry
If I don't wake up from this dream
I think I'm gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, ah!
Where am I?
You're in a cheap, run-down teenage jail, that's where
Oh my God!
Yeah, blondie, you're gonna be here 'til you're 18, so get used to it
Behind the bars, there's a superstar
Who never had a chance
She could sing, she could dance
You don't sing and dance in juvie, honey
Behind the walls, they've seen it all
Gotta have, gotta have

Justice, justice
Don't want your law and order
Justice, justice
Or worldwide disorder

What you in for?
Wouldn't you like to know, ooh
Behind the fence, there's no defense
There's murder, rape and bribery
In and out, burglary
You don't look so tough
Ah, I been around
On the planet sorrow, there's no tomorrow
Gonna get, gonna get
Justice, justice
Don't want your law and order
Justice, justice
Or worldwide disorder

You can't turn off the tears
They crawl in juvenile hall
Cruel reform schools
They don't smile
They got no bail or jury trial
Joan, let's break out tonight
Okay, Cherie, what's the plan?
You grab the guard, in the prison yard
Get his keys and gun, we'll run
My old man's waiting outside in a van
Is he handsome?
You'll see, you'll see
'Cause you know we gotta be free

Justice, justice
Don't want your law and order
Justice, justice
Or worldwide disorder

We'll go far through the prison yard
You and me, we will be free
Just be safe, don't be late
If you see the guard don't hesitate
But Joan, I'm getting tired
I've run out of fire
I can't go any farther
But Cherie, you must try harder
Joan, I'm down, my ankle
I can't go on, but I can't leave you
What do I do?
Save yourself, you gotta save yourself
You know what you gotta do
