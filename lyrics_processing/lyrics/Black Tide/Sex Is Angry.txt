I know no one else can make you scream like me
Our love is just like a war
But when it hurts I know
That you just want me more
You can make me miserable
Bring out the worst in me
But you're so fucking beautiful
So go on and hate me, disrespect me
I love it when the sex is angry
This is almost suicidal
Might be the death of me
But you're so irresistible
So go on and hate me, berate me
I love it when the sex is angry
Now we only speak when we're arguing
You got me scratched and bruised
But I don't feel a thing
Shoulda walked out that door long ago
But when it hurts I find myself wanting you more
You can make me miserable
Bring out the worst in me
But you're so fucking beautiful
So go on and hate me, disrespect me
I love it when the sex is angry
You might also likeThis is almost suicidal
Might be the death of me
But you're so irresistible
So go on and hate me, berate me
I love it when the sex is angry
Our love is just like a war
No retreat, no remorse
Baby I love the way you scream
Yeah I'm that fire and you're kerosene
Baby I love it when we fight
Cause when it ends, we're both satisfied
This love is just like a war
So when it hurts I find myself wanting it more
I love it..I love it..I love it when the sex is angry
You can make me miserable
Bring out the worst in me
But you're so fucking beautiful
So go on and hate me, disrespect me
I love it when the sex is angry
This is almost suicidal
Might be the death of me
But you're so irresistible
So go on and hate me, berate me
