Hey ey!
Ye ah ah!
Let it out!
Hey!
Hey ey!
Yea ah ah!
Let it out!
You like to bite your own tongue
Shouldn't keep your mind closed
Gotta let them all know
What your capable of
Don't second guess your heart
Go with what feels right
Gotta let them all know
What you locked up inside
Shouldn't hold on to things
That won't let you move on
Shouldn't hold yourself
Let yourself go
Let it out, say what you have to say
Cause it's not worth the wait, let it out
And don't back down, don't turn away
No it's not worth the wait and not worth the pain
So let it out, let it out
You might also likeDon't wanna look back and think
You could have made things alright
With just one simple line
You chose to keep in your mind
You wanna look back and say
I did the best that I could
Maybe my best wasn't enough
(But it's the thought that counts)
Shouldn't hold on to the things
That won't let you move on
Shouldn't hold yourself back
Let yourself go and...
Let it out say what you have to say
Cause it's not worth the wait let it out
And don't back down don't turn away
No it's not worth the wait and it's not worth the pain
So let it out, let it out
You wanna look back and say
You wanna look back and feel
I did the best that I could
I did the best that I could
You wanna look back and say
You wanna look back and feel
I am proud of
All that I have done!
Shouldn't hold on to the things
That won't let you move on
Shouldn't hold yourself back
Let yourself (go)
Let it out say what you have to say
Cause it's not worth the wait let it out
Let it out say what you have to say
Cause it's not worth the wait let it out
And don't back down don't turn away
No it's not worth the wait and it's not worth the pain
So let it out, let it out!
Let it out say what you have to say
Cause it's not worth the wait (just) let it out (let it out)
And don't back down don't turn away
No it's not worth the wait and it's not worth the pain
