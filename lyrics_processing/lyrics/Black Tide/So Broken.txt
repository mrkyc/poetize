Life's mischief's have left me hollow
Things aren't as perfect as they seem
Trapped inside of a poisoned temple
Forced onto a path that's crumbled
I've lost the better part's of me
(Have you ever felt so lost)
(Like familiar roads are far away)
(Have you ever felt so broken, so broken)
Yeah - my part is happening
With a little faith, we'll make it out
Yeah - this inner part of me, inspired
Make our way towards a paradise
So broken - so broken
Don't understand why I'm still here standing?
Come to think I'm the one there hanging
Don't care if I'm left here all alone
Forcing me to become the hunter
Dreams break they're lost in the gutter
I'll gather the pieces on my own
(Have you ever felt so lost)
(Like familiar faces are estranged)
(Have you ever felt so broken, so broken)

With a little faith, we'll make it out
Yeah - this inner part of me, inspired
Make our way towards a paradise
So broken - so broken
Trapped in this corner with a dream
Hell set to make reality
It's not over. (not over)
Seems so simple - I'll do what it takes
Stay strong as the flames burn higher
Bet you're ready to toss your reminder
I'll never forget where I've gone wrong
Feels like we live in a nightmare
Time to wake and shake off the fear
I'll never look back on what I've done
(Have you ever felt so lost)
(Like familiar roads are far away)
(Have you ever felt so broken, so broken)
Yeah - my part is happening
With a little pain, we'll make it out
Yeah - this inner part of me, inspired
Make our way towards a paradise
Have you ever felt so lost
Like familiar faces are estranged
Have you ever felt so broken
