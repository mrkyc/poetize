You roam the streets so proud
I wonder what goes on in your head
Wonder if you've ever thought about
The things that matter most
Not just bout who you know
Or about who you think you are
You should just end this now
Before you get taken out
I'll let you be my shadow
I'll let you go the distance
So the world can see your a fuckin joke
Should've never been so damn vain
You'll never make it with a fake dream
So run your mouth with a death wish
Walking dead man
Should've never said a damn word
Drove yourself into the gutter
So run your mouth a death wish
Walking dead man
The stage was just a show
Get the fuck back down to earth now
I'm beginning to think you really believed
You were something worthy of fame
The only thing you've got is a crew
Of friends that pity you
I've got no pity for a fuckin coward
You might also likeI'll let you be my shadow
I'll let you go the distance
So the world can see your a fuckin joke
Should've never been so damn vain
You'll never make it with a fake dream
So run your mouth with a death wish
Walking dead man
Should've never said a damn word
Drove yourself into the gutter
So run your mouth a death wish
Walking dead man
You are nothing. you have no one
You have no heart, no mind of your own
You have no mind of your own
I'll let you be my shadow
I'll let you go the distance
Let you travel the world
So you can see what your missing
I'll let you be my shadow
Should've never been so damn vain
You'll never make it with a fake dream
So run your mouth with a death wish
Walking dead man
Should've never said a damn word
Drove yourself into the gutter
So run your mouth a death wish
