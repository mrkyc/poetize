Hey, boy, stop pacing 'round the room
Using other people's faces as a mirror for you
I know your lungs need filling
Since your gums have lost their feeling
But don't say that you're givin' it up again
"Do you have a card?
My irregular heart beat is starting to correct itself"
It's just a simple diarrhetic that prevents the empathetic
From being just and givin' it up (Givin' it up)

And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fuckin'
You're meant to be helpin' me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize that I, I'm not givin' it up again

This conversation's not about reciprocation no more
But I'm gon' wait until you finish so I can talk some more
About me and my things, my car, my living
And how I'm givin' it up, givin' it up again

And you're the only thing that's goin' on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fuckin'
You're meant to be helpin' me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize that I, I'm not givin' it up again

Oh, the kick won't last for long, but the song only lasts three minutes
I think I've lost my phone, so won't you call it up for me?
Oh, the kick won't last for long, but the song only lasts three minutes
And I know it's wrong, but give me one

And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fuckin'
You're meant to be helpin' me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize that I, I'm not givin' it up again

I'm not givin' it up, I'm not givin' it up
I'm not givin' it up, I'm not givin' it up
I'm not givin' it up, givin' it up
