Danny ran into some complications
He falls asleep during conversations
He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation
The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation

And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you

And Danny says we're living in a simulation
But he works in a petrol station (Selling petrol)
He says it all began with his operation
And I know you think you're sly, but you need some imagination

And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose, then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you
You might also like
I can't stop sweating or control my feet
Got a twenty-stone monkey that I just can't beat
I can stage a situation, but I just can't eat
And there's a feeling, you're replacing embrace

It's true that all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose, then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you

Oh, and Johnny got a job in a bank, I think
And he spent the time trying to pack in the drinks for me
I feel sick and I know that I'll lose, but
It's not living if it's not with you
(It's not, it's not)
It's not living if it's not with you
(It's not, it's not)
(It's not, it's not)
It's not living if it's not with you
(It's not living if it's not with you)
(It's not, it's not)
(It's not, it's not)
(It's not, it's not)
