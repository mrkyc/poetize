A soft sound
Into the way that she wears her hair down
Covering up her face
And oh, what a letdown
And I don't seem to be having any effect now
Falling all over the place

But you're losing your words
We're speaking in bodies
Avoiding me and talking 'bout you
And you're losing your turn
I guess I'll never learn
'Cause I stay another hour or two

For crying out loud, settle down
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you

A small town
Dictating all the people we get around
What a familiar face
Do you get what I mean now?
I'm so fixated on the girl with the soft sound
And hair all over the place
You might also like
And you're sure that I'd learn
I'm pushing through bodies
Avoiding me and walking 'round you
And you're cold and I burn
I guess I'll never learn
'Cause I stay another hour or two

For crying out loud, settle down
You know I can't be found with you, you
And we get back to my house
Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you
(Hey)


A soft sound
Into the way that she wears her hair down
Covering up her face
And oh, what a letdown, down
I don't seem to be having any effect now
Falling all over the place
And you're losing your words
We're speaking in bodies
Avoiding me and talking 'bout you
And you're losing your turn
I guess I'll never learn
'Cause I stay another hour or two

For crying out loud, settle down
You know I can't be found with you, you
We get back to my house
Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you, 'round you
