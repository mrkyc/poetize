And you're a liar
At least all of your friends are
And so am I
Just typically drowned in my car
It's my party
And I'll cry to the end
You must try harder
Than kissing all of my friends, you

Yeah, it takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you

And you're alive
At least as far as I can tell you are
And so am I
You beat me down and then we're back to my car
And it's so ironic
How it's only been a year
And it's not my fault
That I fucked everybody here

Straight lines, they unwind you
She does a little thing with her eyes that says, "We're off soon"
She says the bleeding's incidental 'cause she's so cool
She said, "I'm no fun if I've only a bottle of wine"

And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time

Slow down, yeah, I want you
She does a little bit on the sly that shows what she's up to
She started talking about missing him, she was glistening
It won't mend your heart if it's only a couple of lines

And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
