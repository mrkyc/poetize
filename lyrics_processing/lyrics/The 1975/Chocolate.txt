Hey now, call it a split because I know that you will
Oh-oh, you bite your friend like chocolate
You said we go where nobody know
With guns hidden under our petticoat
No, we're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no
Now we run, run away from the boys in the blue
Oh, my car smells like chocolate
Hey now, I think about what to do
I think about what to say, I think about how to think
Pause it, play it, pause it, play it, pause it

Oh, we go where nobody know
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe
We got guns hidden under our petticoat
No, we're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no

Now you're never gonna quit it, now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it if you don't stop smoking it
That's what she said
She said we're dressed in black, head to toe
With guns hidden under our petticoat
Mm, we're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no

And play it cool

Guns hidden under our petticoat
