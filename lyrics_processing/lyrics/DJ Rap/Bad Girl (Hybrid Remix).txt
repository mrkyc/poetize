And you've got to make waves
Gonna be a bad girl, to be heard
Assen your wicked ways
Gone be a bad girl, in this world
And you've got to make waves
Gonna be a bad girl, to be heard
And that's what I say
Gotta be a bad girl

A silent conversation passes through the world
A million voices who are never really heard
A thousand reasons why our self-esteem can't stand
A million women let it slip right through their hands
Don't show me anger 'cos your anitudes could change
That glass ceiling should be radically erased
I'm trying to show you that as friends we'd get along
Respect my body 'cos that's where you came from
