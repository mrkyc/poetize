"You, you, you
Do you know that bad girls go to hell?"
A silent conversation passes through the world
A million voices who are never really heard
A thousand reasons why our self-esteem can't stand
A million women let it slip right through their hands
Don't show me anger 'cause your attitudes could change
That glass ceiling should be radically erased
I'm trying to show you that as friends we'd get along
Respect my body 'cause that's where you came from
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
Oh, you gotta be a bad girl in this world
And you've got to make waves
Gotta be a bad girl to be heard
Aside your wicked ways
Gotta be a bad girl in this world
And you've got to make waves
Gotta be a bad girl to be heard
And that's what I say
You might also likeIt's just on loan to you, it's my identity
I'd love to love you if you give it back to me
Don't criticize me 'cause I know it's overdue
I've learned my lessons well by following your moves
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
Oh, you gotta be a bad girl in this world
And you've got to make waves
Oh, you gotta be a bad girl in this world
And that's what I say
That's what I say
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
