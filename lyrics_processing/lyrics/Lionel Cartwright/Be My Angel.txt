I can't forget the first time that I saw you
I watched your every move out on the floor
All my friends said go ahead and ask her
But me I've never done this dance before

You took my hand, led me away
I could hear the caller say

Bow to your partner, your corner too (Be my angel)
Send the girls to the middle, watch 'em start through
Flutter the wheel as you reel (Be my angel tonight)
The more that you're dancing, the better you feel
So, alaman left, do a right left grand (Be my angel)
When you meet your partner, give her your hand
Then you all promenade (Be my angel tonight)
Heading home with your angel tonight

Since that night, we've held on to each other
And every step we took was side by side
With each move I made, you were right with me
You stayed by me through all the turns in life
You might also like
And I'd have never made it through
This dance without you

Bow to your partner, your corner too (Be my angel)
Send the girls to the middle, watch 'em start through
Flutter the wheel as you reel (Be my angel tonight)
The more that you're dancing, the better you feel
So, alaman left, do a right left grand (Be my angel)
When you meet your partner, give her your hand
Then you all promenade (Be my angel tonight)
Heading home with your angel tonight

And I need you now like I did back then
Be my guiding angel once again


Bow to your partner, your corner too (Be my angel)
Send the girls to the middle, watch 'em start through
Flutter the wheel as you reel (Be my angel tonight)
The more that you're dancing, the better you feel
So, alaman left, do a right left grand (Be my angel)
When you meet your partner, give her your hand
Then you all promenade (Be my angel tonight)
Heading home with your angel tonight
Be my angel
