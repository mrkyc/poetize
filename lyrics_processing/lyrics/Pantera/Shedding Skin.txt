I don't want you to look at me while I'm shedding skin
I can't afford for you to see what's in
I'd rather shoot myself than have you watch me
I feel you'd steal my skin to try and wear me

I was betrayed one more day
Of my short life
You were carried away, had no shame
To suffocate my being
I was me, but you weren't you
You were sticking to me like a scab
So I peeled you away, bled for days
Then stepped out of myself

I'm shedding skin
Changing within, falling in
Through swollen eyes
I'd dreamed you died, caught inside
I'm shedding skin
Spreading thin, severed stem
I created the end, killing a friend
I'm shedding my skin
You might also like
I don't think you belong in here, I feel I'm sick
Don't ask, because you know damn well where I've been
I've kept a simple woman through the thick and thin
But I've found the guts to sever from my Siamese twin

I throw you away every day
A dead part of life
Strangling back, seething black
In between my longing for torture
Blood on my face that came from your face
A mix of kissing and bleeding
I put you away, I shut you away
I pissed you away, I threw you away

I'm shedding skin
Changing within, falling in
Through swollen eyes
I'd dreamed you died, caught inside
I'm shedding skin
Spreading thin, severed stem
I created the end, killing a friend
I'm shedding my skin
You're fucking and sucking
You're friendless, it's endless
Your flower has soured
It's endless, you're friendless
It's harder and stronger
But no one's been inside you longer and harder and deeper
To get you off, you need the fear, the fear, the fear, the fear, the fear

It's never love, bloody touch
Broken wrist, needle rust
Choking throat, swallowed teeth
Headfuck, no peace

I'm shedding my skin
To peel you off of me
You've got to love me


Ornament, shrunken head
Playtoy, snake strike
Poisonous, syphilis
Drenched me, soaked me
I'm shedding my skin
To drain you out of me
