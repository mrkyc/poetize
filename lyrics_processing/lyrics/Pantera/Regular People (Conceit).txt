I've trampled on that road
That you think you own
You have that "smart-ass" attitude
It's time to stop the fiction
I live it every day
While your mind's far away
I'm out here putting pride on the line
And you case on me with pure respect
One chance at one thing
Hard time is coming
My time, your pain, I reign on you

You, you think you own
I take away, take it with me
I see you, you think you own
I took away, make it my own

Most regular people would say
It's hard
And any streetwise son of a bitch knows
Don't fuck with this
Most regular people would say
It's hard
And any streetwise son of a bitch knows
Don't fuck with this
You might also like
Then so many times
You practice in your mirror
To be just like me, but you just can't see
That you ain't got the balls, son
I fight for love of brother
Your friends fight one another
You can't see because your head's up your ass
And just in case you think you're bad
I crush your rush; I rule, you fool
Immovable stone in your world of weak, I speak

You, you think you own
I take away, take it with me
I see you, you think you own
I took away, make it my own

Most regular people would say
It's hard
And any streetwise son of a bitch knows
Don't fuck with this
Most regular people would say
It's hard
And any streetwise son of a bitch knows
Don't fuck with this

Most regular people would say
It's hard
And any streetwise son of a bitch knows
Don't fuck with this
Most regular people would say
It's hard
And any streetwise son of a bitch knows
Don't fuck with this
