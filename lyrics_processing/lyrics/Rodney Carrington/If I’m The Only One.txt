And people said you had a rocky past; it never mattered to me
You say I'm the only one but there's pictures on our wall
Of you and your ex-boyfriend kissing at the mall
If I'm the only one you ever loved
How come you still talk to him?
If I'm the only one you ever loved
How come our baby looks just like Tim?
Just asking questions I don't mean to pry
You got all the answers so baby just tell me why
If I'm the only one you ever loved
Who's underwear are these?
If I'm the only one you ever loved
How come you got so many Mardi Gras beads?
You say that I'm the only one you loved
You didn't come home the other night you said you had to work late
I came by your office with some cookies I baked
I walked in and I saw him and his hands were in your hair
And both your feet were pointed in the air
If I'm the only one you ever loved
How come your boss is all over you?
If I'm the only one you ever loved
How come his pants are down around his shoes?
Just asking questions I don't mean to pry
You got all the answers so baby just tell me why
You might also likeI just need an explanation so I can understand
Why when I came home last night there was a naked man
Running across our land with his clothes in his hand
He ran...
If I'm the only one you ever loved
How come your name's on the bathroom wall?
If I'm the only one you ever loved
How come it says "for a good time, call"?
You say that I'm the only one you loved
But you spent the night on 50 Cent's tour bus
