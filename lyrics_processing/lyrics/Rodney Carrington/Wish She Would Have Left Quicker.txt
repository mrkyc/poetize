The car in the driveway was gone
A note on the table said I wasn't able
To give her the things that she wants
I didn't see it comin' my mind started runnin'
How could she have left me this way
Now I'm just wishin' someday she'll listen
'Cause I know just what I would say
I wish she would have left quicker
I woulda had lots more fun
There coulda been shots of tequila
With Sherry and Sheila
Bikinis with bottoms no tops
Someone's happy man
With no ring on my hand
I wish she would of left quicker
Bartender pour me some liquor
She's finally gone now the party is on
I wish she would of left quicker
I had my chances passed up advances
Tryin' to be a good guy
I worked hard till sundown
I always felt rundown
Tryin' to do what was right
Had no way of knowin' where this thing was goin'
You might also likeNow it's clear it went on way too long
Maybe someday baby I'll get my way
When she hears the words to this song
I wish she would of left quicker
I woulda had lots more fun
I know a bartender hottie
She's workin' Friday
Boys I'd love to give it a try
And I think you know why
'Cause I'm a single guy
I wish she would of left quicker
Bartender pour me some liquor
She's finally gone now the party's on
I wish she would of left quicker
All my friends now they keep tellin' me
I need some time to heal
But the only thing that I'm thinkin' 'bout
Is how good I feel
I wish she would of left quicker
Bartender pour me some liquor
She's finally gone now the party's on
I wish she would of left quicker
She's finally gone now the party is on
I wish she would of left quicker
I feel good boys
