You say love is messed up
You say that it don't work
You don't wanna try, no, no
(You don't wanna try, no, no)
And baby, I'm no stranger
To heartbreak and the pain of
Always being let go (Always being let go)

And I know there's no makin' this right, this right (This right)
And I know there's no changing your mind, your mind (Your mind)
But we both found each other tonight, tonight (Oh yeah)
So if love is nothing more than just a waste of your time

Waste it on me, waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Baby, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)

So we don't gotta go there
Past lovers and warfare
It's just you and me now (Yeah, yeah)
I don't know your secrets
But I'll pick up the pieces
Pull you close to me now (Yeah, yeah)

Yeah, don't you think there must be a reason?
Yeah, like we had our names
Don't you think we got another season
That come after spring?
I wanna be your summer
I wanna be your wave
Treat me like a comma
I'll take you to a new phrase
Yeah, come just eat me and throw me away
If I'm not your taste, babe, waste
Waste it on me
