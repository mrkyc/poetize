I'm a good pretender
Won't you come see my show?
Won't you come see my show?
I've got lots of problems
Well, good thing nobody knows

Oh, I'm insecure, I'm insecure
I think I lack what I'm supposed to
Lack what I'm supposed to
I don't even mess with drugs
I do that 'cause you say it's dope to
You say it is dope to

I'm a good pretender
I'm not really cool
I'm a good pretender
'Cause I'm just like you
I do not belong here
You all clearly do
But I'm a good pretender

Steve Aoki, Lil Boat
I look happy in every picture
Just so you'd think I am
I never say no to pictures
'Cause that's just the person I am
In high school, I was tryna figure myself out
I was tryna be just like him (Okay)
I'm tryna do things I don't usually do (Why?)
I'm pretending to be too cool (Ha)
I wish my mother had more sons
I wish my friends were my brothers
I wish my ex-girlfriend didn't cheat, she pretended to be my lover
In front of the camera screen
I make it look just like a movie scene (Yah)
Diamonds on my hand, call me Lord of The Rings ('Kay)
Still insecure behind the scenes, though

Oh, I'm insecure, I'm insecure
I think I lack what I'm supposed to
Lack what I'm supposed to
I don't even mess with drugs
I do that 'cause you say it's dope to
