Lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie

You used to like me touching you
You used to feel the sparks
I used to make you love with madness
I used to have your heart (Mmm)
You used to keep your hand in the small of my back
I used to make you glow
We used to become one like magnets
And now you wanna go, oh

And I don't wanna know, ah
Baby, can we turn back the time?
Turn the clocks to when you were mine
If you don't wanna stay
If there's no other way
Then baby, lie to me

Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Then baby, lie to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie

I don't know what you want from me
But you can have it all
I promise to be all you're after
Just don't walk out the door
So look me in the eyes, let me show you my truth
I promise not to cry
No, don't get down to tie your laces
Don't say what's on your mind, oh no

'Cause I don't wanna know, oh
Baby, can we turn back the time?
Turn the clock to when you were mine
If you don't wanna stay
If there's no other way
But baby, lie to me

Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Then baby, lie to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Then baby, lie to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Then baby, lie to me, oh no
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Maybe we can just re-align
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
I'll be good, I promise this time
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
If you don't wanna stay
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
If there's no other way
Lie, lie, lie
