Ayy, if I (Steve Aoki), if I
If I told you that I love you (Wale)
Ayy, if I told you that I love you
Would you think I'm lyin'?
Tell you that I love you

Niggas that been through it all
Catch me a body on many a song
I like a bitch with a body and mind
I climb in her eyes to get to them draws
Hot as July on a Wimbledon court
Hop out the ride, the windows go up
Holler or holla?
Then call the promoter
Pull up and I go and then turn that bitch up
Caught me a body in many a club
Want a Bugatti, I'm spending too much
Wanna do Molly, then holla at Bari
But trust me you want it, you gonna be up
Handle my business get rid of these boys
Ask all my haters come gimme some more
Never was trapping, but I got that crack and
That Bando was jumping like instrument stores
See Steve Aoki LiveGet tickets as low as $59You might also like

If I told you that I love you, love you
If I tell you that I love you, love you, love you

Catch me somewhere with that positive vibe
The moon and the sky, I'm stunnin' 'em all
Trust me lil youngin' the summer is odd
Fucking with the pop in plug and record
Stunting, stunting, stunting, stunting so hard
Think I'm finna get my body insured, yeah, ooh
Stop being jealous, no, I'm not a killer, but I got me a gun, yeah, ooh
I'm shining forever the prodigal son of the diamond I'm from
I'm just a chip from the diamond I'm from
Got popular young when rapping was fun
Show off my nigga, go show off my nigga
You show out enough, they clap and applaud
Perform
