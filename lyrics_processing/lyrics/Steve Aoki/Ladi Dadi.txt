Dim the lights
So you can't see me
Close your mouth
Don't speak, just feel me
Closer we become
Together we will fall, than we're one
This night, this night
We give ourselves one night

The mood is set
The food is eatin'
The time is right
For love, it's beating

A little bit of talk, a little bit of pleasure
A little bit of makin' out and than we work it out
A little smokey-smoke, tell me a dirty joke
Up on your roof, up on your roof
And we don't need nobody to have a little party
It's just us two, just us two
And we don't need nobody cause we go ladi dadi
Just us two, me and you, me and you
Two, two, two, two (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Feel the kiss
And smile so softly
We're just friends
But I like you slightly
We won't cross the line
We'll go on proper, takes some time
Just a boy and a girl
Just us two in a world

The mood is set
The food is eatin'
The time is right
For love, it's beating

A little bit of talk, a little bit of pleasure
A little bit of makin' out and than we work it out
A little smokey-smoke, tell me a dirty joke
Up on your roof, up on your roof
And we don't need nobody to have a little party
It's just us two, just us two
And we don't need nobody cause we go ladi dadi
Just us two, me and you, me and you
Take a walk with me
And we'll go dancing in the rain
And, baby, we'll run under a tree
I'll look at you, you'll look at me

A little bit of talk, a little bit of pleasure
A little bit of makin' out and than we work it out
A little smokey-smoke, tell me a dirty joke
Up on your roof, up on your roof
And we don't need nobody to have a little party
It's just us two, just us two
And we don't need nobody cause we go ladi dadi
