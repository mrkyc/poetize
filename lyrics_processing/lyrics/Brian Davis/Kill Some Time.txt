Bossman done got his forty
That field done got it's round-round
Washed off a week's worth of dirty
That truck's shined up and wrecks the town
Whole time I've been sweatin' like this
Girl I've been thinkin' 'bout your next kiss
Now you're looking like that climbin' up in the cab
Girl all I wanna do

I wanna hit that party with you
Wanna throw some drinks back with you
Wanna watch you do what you do
'Cause you know what I like
Wanna get to kicking back on that hearth
Wanna get to gettin' back to feelin' good
All I wanna do tonight
Is kill some time with you

You sure know how to work it
Way you slide, my, the way you smile like that
And it makes the whole grind worth it
Just knowing I'm gonna be out wherever you're at
Around seven on Friday night
You're that fine up in the dashboard lights
You might also like
Girl you got me like
I wanna hit that party with you
Wanna throw some drinks back with you
Wanna watch you do what you do
'Cause you know what I like
Wanna get to kicking back on that hearth
Want get to gettin' back to feelin' good
All I wanna do tonight
Is kill some time with you girl
C'mon!

Well I'm just gonna stop and show you off
A little while you can lay 'em on
Step off baby all alone
Just like you want

I wanna hit that party with you
Wanna throw some drinks back with you
Wanna watch you do what you do
'Cause you know what I like
Wanna get to kicking back on that hearth
Want get to gettin' back to feelin' good
All I wanna do tonight
Is kill some time with you
Girl all I wanna do tonight
Is kill some time with you babe
I wanna kill some time with you babe
I wanna kill some time with you babe
