If you like the sound of a diesel runnin' in the driveway
If your boots go to church with you on Sunday
If your hat goes over your heart when that anthem plays
If you're damn proud of the ones fightin' for the good ol' USA

Then I could drink a beer with ya
Drink a beer with ya
Do a little tailgate sittin
I could chill with ya
Rock a grill with ya
Do a little moonshine sippin' with ya
It's my party
It's my throwdown
I get to say who's in and out
So if you're straight up country
You know what I'm talkin' about
I could drink a beer with ya
Drink a beer with ya, yeah
Oh, I could drink a beer with ya
Drink a beer with ya

If you like the sight of a mud hole sittin' in the high beams
If you know Jesus got your back, John 3: 16
If you load that chest when you get that check at the end of the week
If a blue collar workin' man blood is all you bleed
You might also like
Then I could drink a beer with ya
Drink a beer with ya
Do a little tailgate sittin
I could chill with ya
Rock a grill with ya
Do a little moonshine sippin' with ya
It's my party
