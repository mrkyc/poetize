Oh, the lights of my hometown
They come alive when the sun goes down
You know the lights of my hometown
They come alive when the sun goes down

Yeah, I'm talking 'bout the 50-yard line on a Friday night
Mainstreet drag lined up with red tail lights
Yeah, the dashboard glow from the radio
Get the console back, pull your girl real close
Got the summer stars out in the backwoods
Got the windows down yeah, you feel so good
To lock your high beams in on a mud hole
If you're where I'm from, then you damn sure know

About the lights of my hometown
Yeah, they come alive when the sun goes down
Oh yeah, you know the lights of my hometown
Oh yeah, they come alive when the sun goes down

Oh yeah, we hold our lighters up if it's a good song
Little Lynyrd Skynyrd getcha singin' along
Now buy some gasoline on a pile of wood
A little too much will make it burn real good
We got the moonshine, I'm talkin' both kinds
Getcha seein' double lookin' at them tanlines
Yeah, we're throwin' down 'til the cops come
See the blue lights flash, boys it's time to run

And the lights of my hometown
Oh yeah, they come alive when the sun goes down
Oh yeah, you know the lights of my hometown
Oh yeah, they come alive when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down, sun goes down

How 'bout a flashlight on a gravestone
Let your best friend know that he ain't alone
Go on and pop a top, pour a little out
Just to let him know we're still thinkin' about him

And lights of our hometown
He almost comes alive when the sun goes down
Oh yeah, you know the lights of our hometown
Oh yeah, they come alive when the sun goes down
Oh yeah, you know the lights of my hometown
Oh yeah, they come alive when the sun goes down
Oh yeah, you know the lights of my hometown
Oh yeah, they come alive when the sun goes down
Yeah

Oh yeah, we come alive when the sun goes down
Oh yeah, you know the lights of my hometown
