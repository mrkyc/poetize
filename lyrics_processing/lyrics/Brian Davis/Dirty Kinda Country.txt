She's got a Baptist background, raised in a small town
Sunflower queened crown two years in a row
She's got that Cindy Crawford beauty mark
The classic southern bell charm
The kind you take home that momma that momma doesn't know
All she wants to do when she gets in my ol' truck
Is crank up some Haggard and put it in the mud

She's a lady, when she needs to be
The country club girl, the country boys' dream
She's the best of both worlds, if you know what I mean
She's a lady when she needs to be
But she can be down right, turn me on
Dirty kinda country

I watched her grow up at the fair grounds
Showin' off her daddy's cows
Never thought she'd come around, but there she goes
In that Bocephus tshirt, high heels and mini skirt
Kickin' up the dirt down a red dirt road
When the sun hits the tree line, there's one thing on her mind
Long necks and pool sticks and havin' a good time
You might also like
She's a lady, when she needs to be
The country club girl, oh the country boys' dream
She's the best of both worlds, if you know what I mean
She's a lady when she needs to be
But she can be down right, turn me on
Dirty kinda country
Oh yeah

She ain't much on chewin' snuff
But she don't mind my Skoal ring
Get down in the bed of my truck
We do our own thing
She ain't much on chewin' snuff
But she don't mind my Skoal ring
Get down in the bed of my truck
We do our own thing

She's a lady, when she needs to be
The country club girl, oh the country boys' dream
She's the best of both worlds, if you know what I mean
She's a lady when she needs to be
But she can be down right, turn me on
Dirty, a lady when she needs to be
But she can be down right, turn me on
Dirty kinda country
Dirty kinda country
Oh that dirty kinda country
