Right now, it's coolers iced
Good ol' boys, good ol' girls
Lookin' to burn down this night
Tailgates dropped, radios up
Little jack, little crown spillin down, fillin' up those cups

They're probably starin' down that muddy field
Waitin' on my high beams, my KCs
They know I wouldn't miss a party like that for anything
But they can't see what I see

I'm layin', layin' you down on the other side of town
Nobody around, but you and me baby
The high that you got me on is some kinda strong
Your whiskey kiss is all that I need
So give me one more
Just like the first four
And I'll hold you all night long girl
Come lay your head down
Down on my chest
It's a party for two in this truck bed

Right now, the whiskey's chilled
Radio low, you and me, kickin' it up on this hill
The moon's shinin', the stars are bright
But I've never seen 'em, like I see 'em, when I see 'em in your eyes
You might also like
They're probably starin' down that muddy field
Waitin' on my high beams, my KCs
That's why I picked this spot where only my truck can make it
Girl, in case they came lookin' for me

I'm layin', layin' you down on the other side of town
Nobody around, but you and me baby
The high that you got me on is some kinda strong
Your whiskey kiss is all that I need
So give me one more
Just like the first four
And I'll hold you all night long girl
Come lay your head down
Down on my chest
It's a party for two in this truck bed

They're probably starin' down that muddy field
Waitin' on my high beams, my KCs
I'm wrapped up in Heaven with you right now
I ain't goin' nowhere baby

I'm layin', layin' you down on the other side of town
Nobody around, but you and me baby
The high that you got me on is some kinda strong
Your whiskey kiss is all that I need
So give me one more
Just like the first four
And I'll hold you all night long girl
Come lay your head down
Down on my chest
It's a party for two in this truck bed
