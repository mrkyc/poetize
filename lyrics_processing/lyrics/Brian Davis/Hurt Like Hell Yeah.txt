We was pre-gamin' in the parkin' lot
Tailgates dropped, tops popped
Pretty little things shakin' their thing
Hank on the radio
Well everything was cool 'til my boy Hoss
Broke out the 'shine and the lid got lost
I said Hoss, I hate you 'cause, I can't say no
Yeah I know myself well enough to know

This is gonna hurt like hell, gonna leave a scar
Gonna wish I didn't do this tonight tomorrow
Mornin' when I wake up, slap tore up
In the bed of my pickup truck
With a what's my name and where am I at
What train hit me and where's my hat
Yeah I can already tell, this is gonna hurt like hell yeah

Well next thing I knew, the preacher's daughter
Walked up to me, sat down her bottle
Hit that 'shine like it was water, and she flashed me a smile
Her pretty little hand took my hand
She whispered "Trouble, where you been"
I said "Girl I thought we was just friends"
She said "Not tonight"
Yeah I know myself well enough to know

This is gonna hurt like hell, gonna leave a scar
Gonna wish I didn't do this tonight tomorrow
Mornin' when I wake up, slap tore up
In the bed of my pickup truck
With a what's your name and where we at
What train hit me and where's my hat
Girl I can already tell, this is gonna hurt like hell yeah, ye-eah

We was just kickin' it up on my tailgate
Me and that girl just doin' our thing
And next thing I know this old boy walked up
With his chest stuck out
He started talkin' 'bout how she was his girl
She said "I used to be but I ain't no more"
So I stood up and said "Boy you oughtta roll right now"
But he kept runnin' that mouth

This is gonna hurt like hell, gonna leave a scar
You're gonna wish you hadn't done this tonight tomorrow
Mornin' when ya wake up, slap fucked up
In the bed of your pickup truck
With a what's your name and where you at
What train hit ya and where's your hat
Boy I can already tell, this is gonna hurt like hell yeah, ye-eah
