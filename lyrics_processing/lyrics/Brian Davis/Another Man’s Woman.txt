That old grapevine sure comes alive
In a small town when someone's runnin' 'round
When they shouldn't be
And that motel Ain't a no tell no more
That old gossip wheel keeps turning 'til
It finally hits the wrong ears
And the tears spill and the heart breaks
And that's more than I could take

And the front page showed it in black and white
The bed of my truck hangin' out the side
Of that dirty run down room off of highway 22
Drove my bumper slam up to the bed
Put my 45 against his head
And before I dropped that hammer down, I said
"You don't lay another man's woman down"

Now I'm sittin' in this 6 by 9 and they
They talkin' about takin' my life
But i don't care if it's wrong or right
I did what I had to do
Lovin' that girl is all I had
It's the reason why I'm where I'm at
The 6th commandment was my sin
But the 7th one did him in
You might also like
And the front page showed it in black and white
The bed of my truck hangin' out the side
Of that dirty run down room off of highway 22
Drove my bumper slam up to the bed
Put my 45 against his head
And before I dropped that hammer down, I said
"You don't lay another man's woman down"
And the front page showed it in black and white
The bed of my truck hangin' out the side
Of that dirty run down room off of highway 22
Drove my bumper slam up to the bed
Put my 45 against his head
And before I dropped that hammer down, I said
"You don't lay another man's no boy
You don't lay another man's woman down
You don't lay another man's woman down
