We said our last goodbyes in the Carolina rain
Sang him home with Ill Fly Away
They say you can't take it with ya when you go
Damn I'm glad
'Cause they was reachin' for his land and the money in his Bible
While I was reachin' for his last

Bottle of Jack, it makes me laugh
And cry at the same time
It takes me back, to the times we had
He'd say, "A little bit will get you right"
And so tonight, I'm gettin' right
Just sippin' from his ol' square glass
Takin' me a little ride back through our past
With Grandpa's last bottle of Jack

Still remember that first time yeah that first sip
Tastes as good right here tonight as it did back then
Yeah we was back porch sittin', laughin' and sippin'
Oh Grandma never asked
It was goin' to my head now it's hittin' my heart
Pullin' from his last
You might also like
Bottle of Jack, it makes me laugh
And cry at the same time
It takes me back, to the times we had
He'd say, "A little bit will get you right"
And so tonight, I'm gettin' right
Just sippin' from his ol' square glass
Takin' me a little ride back through our past
With Grandpa's last bottle of Jack
Yes I am

You see this handle ain't just a handle
And this Jack ain't just Daniels
It's more than just whiskey
It's a straight shot back to his memory
Grandpa's last

Bottle of Jack, it makes me laugh
And cry at the same time
It takes me back, to the times we had
He'd say, "A little bit will get you right"
And so tonight, I'm gettin' right
Just sippin' from his ol' square glass
Takin' me a little ride back through our past
Yeah I'm takin' me a little ride back through our past
With Grandpa's last bottle of Jack
Bottle of Jack
We said our last goodbyes in the Carolina rain
