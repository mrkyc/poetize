Hey y'all it's been a while
Since we all been back here
Circled up round the same fire
Talkin' shit and drinkin' beers
Feels like yesterday
The way ain't nothin' changed
Except these old trucks got a few more miles
And they did back in the day
So tonight

Let's raise 'em up to right now
A little too high, going long way down
Memory lane, remember the days
We was kings of this town
Back when cold beer and girls
Made our worlds go round and round
Crazy how a little time turned things upside down
So tonight
Let's raise 'em up to right now

Break out two more stories
We've told a thousand times
About the days we was really livin'
And all them nights we almost died
Save us a little bit
There in the bottom of these cups
So we can pour some out for the ones
Who can't be here with us
You might also like
Raise 'em up to right now
A little too high, going long way down
Memory lane, remember the days
We was kings of this town
Back when cold beer and girls
Made our worlds go round and round
Crazy how a little time turned things upside down
So tonight
Let's raise 'em up to right now
'Cause we don't know when the next time's gonna come around
We're all here right now
Raise 'em up to right now
A little too high, going long way down
Memory lane, remember the days
We was kings of this town
Back when cold beer and girls
Made our worlds go round and round
Crazy how a little time turned things upside down
So tonight, sit right here
'Til that Sun comes back around
Raise 'em up to right now
Raise 'em up to right now
Oh raise 'em up
Oh, Oh
