Well I usually roll into work ten minutes early
Coffee on my breath and clear eyes
And I usually save my drinking for the weekend
And I ain't smoked a joint in a long damn time

Oh but here lately
The Devil been givin' a good old
Run for his money, oh yeah
Oh here lately
The Devil been givin' a good old
Run for his money, oh yeah

And I normally don't wish bad on anybody
I'm pretty good 'bout turnin' the other cheek
And I only let pretty girls in bars whisper dirty things in my ear
When the one at home ain't runnin' around on me

Oh so here lately
The Devil been givin' a good old
Run for his money, oh yeah
Oh here lately
The Devil been givin' a good old
Run for his money, for his money

Think I'll sit back down
Open up another cold one
Find me a new girl
Call up an old one
Tell her my heart's beat, black and blue
And I need her to get me over you
Get me over you, oh yeah

Say lately
The Devil been givin' a good old
