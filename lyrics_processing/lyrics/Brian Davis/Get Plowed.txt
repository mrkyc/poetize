Dig through the ash tray
Find a little loose change
Wash down the truck
From a weeks worth of farm mud
Tree on the rear view
Bouncing with a new tune
Seat leaned back
Pullin for a 12 pack
Grab my cell phone
Bocephus ring tone
'Cause all my rowdy friends
Wanna know what's goin' on

We gonna get a little buzz
Get a little loud
Get a little crazy with the honky tonk crowd
Crank that country music
It's time to tear it up
Like a field full of good times that's never been touched
Set 'em up row by row watch us knock 'em down
Tonight we gonna get plowed

Pull in the parkin' lot
Barely got a spot
People pushin' there way
Like it's front row George Strait
Pull out my ID
Get a shot of whiskey
Gotta play catch up
'Cause beer won't hold me quick enough
Right now everybody's right where I wanna be
Jumpin', leanin', dancin', screamin'

We gonna get a little buzz
Get a little loud
Get a little crazy with the honky tonk crowd
Crank that country music
It's time to tear it up
Like a field full of good times that's never been touched
Set 'em up row by row watch us knock 'em down
Tonight we gonna get plowed

Tomorrow we'll be sweatin' beer
Sittin' on the John Deere
Head hangin' low
'Cause we didn't wanna go home
Race back to the barn
Grab my second wind
'Cause "All My Rowdy Friends" is ringin' again

We gonna get a little buzz
Get a little loud
Get a little crazy with the honky tonk crowd
Crank that country music
It's time to tear it up
Like a field full of good times that's never been touched
Set 'em up row by row watch us knock 'em down
Tonight we gonna get plowed
Oh yeah
We gonna get plowed go ahead and set 'em up like corn rows Bob Tanner
