Tell me something I don't know
Give me warning signs
It's a lie I already know
Yeah yeah yeah
Tell me stories of old
About the kings and queens so bold
Teach me lullabies
And the tales that's never told
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Turn the pages
There's someone else to get you
Change the channel
There's someone left behind
And watch your words
'Cause there's someone else behind you
Let's turn our backs
It's a crime, it's a crime, a crime
A crime
It's a half-full glass
And the bell's already tolled
It's a warning sign
Is my blood really this cold?
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

'Cause there's someone else behind you
Let's turn our backs
It's a crime, it's a crime, a crime
A crime
Spin a web to pass the time
Perhaps a call to friends of mine
And if it's all the same to you
We'll skip the fables of the past
All the pieces left behind
Begin to tease the peace of mind
Is this how this is meant to be?
Broken bones belong to
You don't know me
You don't know me
You don't know me
You don't know me
You don't know me
You don't know me
You don't know me

You don't know me
You don't know me
You don't know me
This old disguise, this broken back
It's no surprise they all look back
You may suppose it brings to you
The chance to see through all the sides
A thousand laughs, a thousand smiles
A thousand tears lost in the files
And where's the sense in holding on?
For yesterday's already gone
I tried
Already gone
