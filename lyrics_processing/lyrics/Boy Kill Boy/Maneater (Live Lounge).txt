Everybody look at me me
I walk in the door you start screaming
C'mon everybody what you here for
Move your body around like a nympho
Everybody get your neck to crack around
All you crazy people c'mon jump around
I wanna see you all on your knees knees
You either wanna be with me or be me (C'mon now)

Make you buy cars make you cut cards
Make you fall real hard in love

Because she says she love you, love you long time (C'mon now)
