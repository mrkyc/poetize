I won't stay here too long
Just wanna say, wanna say, wanna say
I never meant no harm
Wait for it, wait for it
I don't mind, I don't mind
If you really need to hate me so
If you need to believe that it never
Even meant that much
Just wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for
I know it's no good for me
I know this ain't family
It's all in the way we move
It's all in the way
I'm trying to make you see, you see
When the time comes I'm ready to go
And then it's always so good to know
There's always a home sometimes
There's always a home sometimes
And when the time comes
I am ready to leave
And then it's always so good to believe
There's always a home sometimes
There's always a home
I'm trying to make you see
You might also likeLook away, look away, look away
There's nothing to see here
I'm trying to stay, trying to stay
This is only gonna bring you fear
Wait for it, wait for it
I don't mind, I don't mind
If you really need to let me go
If you need to believe that there
Is really something you should know
Wait for me, wait for me, wait for me
Wait for I know it's no good for me
I know this ain't family
It's all in the way we move
It's all in the way
I'm trying to make you see, you see
When the time comes I'm ready to go
And then it's always so good to know
There's always a home sometimes
There's always a home sometimes
And when the time comes
I am ready to leave
And then it's always so good to believe
There's always a home sometimes
There's always a home
I'm trying to make you see
Oh the lips don't lie
When the time comes I'm ready to go
And then it's always so good to know
There's always a home sometimes
There's always a home sometimes
And when the time comes
I am ready to leave
And then it's always so good to believe
There's always a home sometimes
There's always a home
