A cute one, a shy one
A slim one, a sly one
A big one, a small one
A real off-the-wall one
All I want in this world is to find that girl
A long one, a lean one
A just-in-between one
A short one, a tall one
An any-at-all one
All I want in this world is to find that girl
Oh yeah

I've searched this wide world over
Tryin' to find someone
From New York to California
On a journey that's only begun
I've been from Maine to Memphis
The Motor City to LA
And you might think I get discouraged
But I know that I'll find her some day

A cute one, a shy one
A slim one, a sly one
A big one, a small one
A real off-the-wall one
All I want in this world is to find that girl
A long one, a lean one
A just-in-between one
A short one, a tall one
An any-at-all one
All I want in this world is to find that girl
Oh yeah baby

Girl, I know you're out there somewhere
And there's one thing I want you to know
I believe that for every man there's a girl
And you're the girl for me
And I know it may take a long, long time
But I'm gonna keep right on tryin'
Because you just never ever really know
You may be half-way 'round the world
Or you may, you may be right here, right here tonight

A cute one, a shy one
A slim one, a sly one
A big one, a small one
A real off-the-wall one
All I want in this world is to find that girl
A long one, a lean one
A just-in-between one
A short one, a tall one
An any-at-all one
All I want in this world is to find that girl

That girl
That girl
