Hey y'all it's summertime
Things are going my way, hey
C'mon let's have some fun
Rock it to the break of day, hey
Hey y'all it's summertime
Things are going my way, hey
Don't you want some sunshine?
Summertime in the city

It's the season that I like best
When the guys get fly and the girls look fresh
The time of year when the atmosphere
Sets the trend with the warmth of air
The skies are bright, the temperature's right
I play basketball and I watch the fights
I step out my house, take a breath and stare
Can't you feel it baby-doll, summertime is in the air!

Hey y'all it's summertime
Things are going my way, hey
C'mon let's have some fun
Rock it to the break of day, hey
Hey y'all it's summertime
Things are going my way, hey
Don't you want some sunshine?
Summertime in the city
You might also like
School is out, it's time to rock
Turn on your stereo, turn up your beat-box
 the parks, the beach, city streets
Everywhere you go you can hear the beat
Of me Kurtis Blow in the summer's glow
Now I'm fully equipped with my MC show
So if you get bored, don't know what to do
Turn your radio on and I'll tell you
To get into the groove no time to waste
'Cause out of a year there's only a taste
You see, life in the city can even be pretty
But for those who sleep, well ain't that a pity
You gotta wake up 'cause you're missing the fun
And if you know what I know you got to have some
Get it while it's hot, get it while it's here
Summertime in the city comes once a year!

Hey y'all it's summertime
Things are going my way, hey
C'mon let's have some fun
Rock it to the break of day, hey
Hey y'all it's summertime
Things are going my way, hey
Don't you want some sunshine?
Summertime in the city
Rock baby!
Summertime!
Get funky!
Ooh!
Uh!

Night by night and day by day
Summertime in the city seems to fade away
I look into the sky, when Mother Nature called
She said dress a little warmer 'cause here comes the fall
One day you'll wake up when it comes to an end
Summertime in the city, goodbye my friends
But don't be sad and don't have no fear
'Cause summertime will be back next year!
