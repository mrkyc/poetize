Uh!
Uh!
You know, there a lot of females out there
But I, uh, I saw this one female, this one lady, she was so fine
So, so bad!
You know, if I ever, ever get a chance to get next to her
That would be a dream come true
All jokes in the corner though y'all
If I ever see her again, I'm gonna ask her just one question
Something like this
Hello baby, I want to know
Are you good to go?

'Cause what I feel I don't want to hide
'Cause what I feel is real 'cause it comes from inside
And everytime I see you 
And everytime I see you dance I just wanna rock ya
'Cause you're bad, like the  had
So fine, you should be mine
So sweet, like a flower in June
Oooh, to my room
No, no, I know you're not ready
But the way I feel I want to rock you steady
So continue to dance but then I might have a chance
Hold you tight in arms 'cause I'm talkin' romance
And I know a place where we can be alone
At my house, I want to take you home
