'Cause every time they see me they ask for dough
They think I'm rich 'cause my name is Kurtis Blow
I can't stand it, I can't take it no more
I can't stand it, I can't take it no more
I can't stand it, I can't take it no more
I can't stand it, I can't take it no more
I can't stand it, I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
Lookin' out my window, five stories up
I see a wino with a bottle, he don't need a cup
And there's a hooker in the alley way
Takin' a chance, tryin' to make a day's pay
But the rats in the alley are takin' a stand
Chewin' up on somethin' that used to be a man
I can't stand it, I can't take it no more
I can't stand it, I can't take it no more
You might also likeI can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
Gun shots just up the block
By a kid whose head is hard as a rock
A lady with a baby who was crossing the street
Gets hit by a bullet and falls off her feet
The people gather round, the baby is crying
The ambulance is late and the lady is dying
The trigger happy kid did not step off that day
But the lady with the baby was a D-O-A
I can't stand it, I can't take it no more
I can't stand it, I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more
