When the guys get fly and the girls look fresh
The time of year when the atmosphere
Sets the trend with the warmth of air
The skies are bright, the temperature's right
I play basketball and I watch the fights
I step out my house, take a breath, and stare
Can't you feel it, baby doll, summertime's in the air?
Since school is out, it's time to rock
Turn on your stereo, turn up your beatbox
But the parks, the beach, the city streets
Everywhere you go, you can hear the beat
Of me, Kurtis Blow, in the summer glow
And I'm fully equipped with my MC show
So if you get bored, don't know what to do
Turn your radio on and I'll tell you
To get into the groove, no time to waste
You see, all of the year, there's only a taste
You see, life in the city can even be pretty
But those who sleep, ain't that a pity?
You gotta wake up 'cause you're missing the fun
If you know what I know, you've got to have some
So get it while it's hot, get it while it's here
Summertime comes once a year
You might also likeZip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay
My oh my what a wonderful day
Plenty of sunshine heading my way
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay
You know what I'm saying? Chill out
Get funky with the music
Hit it!
Oh yea, if you meet any fly girls this summer
Tell 'em like...
She'll be coming around the mountain
When she comes, when she comes
She'll be coming around the mountain
When she comes, when she comes
She'll be coming around the mountain
When she comes, when she comes
She'll be coming around the mountain
She'll be coming around the mountain
When she comes, when she comes
She'll be riding one black horsy
When she comes, when she comes
She'll be riding one black horsy
When she comes, when she comes
She'll be riding one black horsy
When she comes, when she comes
She'll be riding one black horsy
She'll be riding one black horsy
