Yo, my brother, I ain't really got it like that
What we got here is hard times
I hear you, brother, but what's up with that?

Hard times spreading just like the flu
You know I caught it just like you
The prices going up, the dollar's down
You got me fallin' to the ground
Turn around, get ready, check out the time
Get ready all people for the future shock
Hard times (Hard times)
Hard times (Hard times)
To the bridge

Get funky!

Hard times, people of the planet
Times are tough, tough is granted
Hard times coming to your town
Get ready 'cause you know we're gonna throw down
I'm gonna go out there and get a skill
My life's been down and I need a thrill
Hard times (Hard times)
Hard times (Hard times)
To the bridge

Sucka! Better watch that!

Hard times's got my pockets all in change
I tell ya what, it don't have my brains
Will I ever-ever-ever reach my peak
We need that dollar every day of the week
Hard times you know, it's a natural trip
I'm gonna keep about it, so we'll not slip
Hard times (Hard times)
Hard times (Hard times)
To the bridge

Hold now!

Hard times is nothing new or mean
I'm gonna use my strong mentality
Like the cream of the crop and the crop of the cream
Beating hard times, that is my dream
Hard times in life, hard times in death
I'm gonna keep on fighting till my very last breath
Hard times (Hard times)
Hard times (Hard times)
To the bridge
Get down!

Hard times is nothing new or mean
I'm gonna use my strong mentality
Like the cream of the crop and the crop of the cream
Beating hard times, that is my dream
Hard times in life, hard times in death
I'm gonna keep on fighting till my very last breath
Hard times (Hard times)
Hard times (Hard times)
To the bridge
