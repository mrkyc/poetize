What did you say your name was?

I see, that it's not clear
For you, good buddy, so clean out your ears
Listen very closely while I pop more game
'Cause my name's in the Hall of Fame
The K-U-R, the T-I-S
The first is the best, I must confess
The B-L-O and the W
I make you wanna catch the boogaloo flu
Now, if your name is Annie
Get up off your fanny
If your name is Clyde
Get off your backside
If your name is Pete
You don't need a seat
'Cause I'm Kurtis Blow and I'm on the go
I'm rocking to the rhythms in stere-ere-o

Now, just throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
If you're ready, like Freddy, to rock real steady
Somebody say, oh yeah! (Oh yeah!)
Young ladies, all the ladies in the house, say, oww! (Oww!)
And you don't stop
Come on, come on, come on, let me see you rock
A get down! Stop messing around
When Kurtis Blow is in your town
I'm Kurtis Blow on the microphone
A place called Harlem was my home
I was rocking one day, it started to shake
It sounded to me a-like a earthquake
I packed my bags, I said goodbye
I kissed my woman, and I started to fly
I came to Earth by a meteorite
To rock you all on the mic
So just kick off your shoes, let your fingers pop
'Cause Kurtis Blow's just about ready to rock
You might also like
Now the people in the back, if you're not the wack, say
(Don't stop the body rock!)
The people in the front, if you want to bump, say
(Don't stop the body rock!)
The people in the middle, if you want to wiggle, say
(Don't stop the body rock!)
And the people on the side, if you want to slide, say
(Don't stop the body rock!)

Not a preacher, or a teacher, or an e-lec-tri-cian
A fighter, or a writer, or a po-li-ti-cian
The man with the key to your ignition
Kurtis Blow is competition
Young ladies, shock the house, jazzy
Yes, young ladies, shock the house
Now, just throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
If y'all really ready to rock the house this morning
Somebody say, oh yeah! (Oh, yeah!)
Somebody scream!

Young ladies, Mercedes
All the ladies in the house, say, oww! (Oww!)
Say, ho! (Ho!)
Ho! (Ho!)
Ho oh! (Ho oh!)

A yes, yes, y'all, keep on
Chick-a-rock-rock-rock, the rock-rock-rock
And don't stop the body rock
And everybody say, ho! (Ho!)
Ho! (Ho!)
And all the brothers, fly guys, get high
Say, macho! (Macho!)
Macho! (Macho!)
Mucho macho! (Mucho macho!)
Ooh, ahh, ooh-ooh ahh! (Ooh, ahh, ooh-ooh ahh!)

Keep on, rocking on
Keep, keep on, rock the hip, the hop on
Like a little boy blue blowing on a horn
The needle on the record, tryna play a song
It's been that way since the day I was born
I like a 25 cent bag of popcorn
Dip-dip-dab, so-socialize
Clean out your ears and open up your eyes
So you goin' here can realize
That I'm here to tranquilize
Got the knack of Kojak, better than Baretta
Casanova Brown, because I'm down
Get down, stop messing around
When Kurtis Blow is in your town
I'm a one of a kind, I'll wreck your mind
Put a wiggle-double-wiggle in your behind
Twice as nice, I'm skatin' on ice
When my mama gave birth, she named me the baddest
MC on Earth, y'all
To the beat that makes you freak
Get out of your seat and freak to the beat
