I gotta move, I gotta split
I haven't got the time to sit
I gotta take what I can get and get away
I gotta jump, I gotta shout
I gotta go without a doubt
I've got to turn this sucker out and get away
Nothin' shakin' nine-to-five, nothin' but some workin' jive
If you want to stay alive you'll get away
Take a car, take a train, if you have to take a plane
Otherwise you'll go insane, so get away!

Got to get away, got to get away, get away
Listen what the people say everyday, get away
Got to listen to the sound, funky music goin' 'round
Happenin' all over town, get on up and get it like you get away
Goo-got-got-got-got-got to get away
Goo-got-got-got-got-got to get away!
Got to get away, got to get away, get away
Listen what the people say everyday, get away
Got to listen to the sound, funky music goin' 'round
Happenin' all over town, get on up and get it like you get away
Goo-got-got-got-got-got to get away
Goo-got-got-got-got-g-g-got to get away!
Goo-got-got-got-got-got to get away
G-g-g-g-g got to get away!

If you work you've got to play, got to take a holiday
Hop into your Chevrolet and get away
Watch a movie, see a show, forget about the status quo
Doesn't matter where you go, just get away
When my working day is done, hit the pavement on the run
Gonna have a little fun and get away
Ain't you sick of where you at, grab your coat and get your hat
Put out the dog and feed the cat and get away!

Got to get away, got to get away, get away
Listen what the people say everyday, get away
Got to listen to the sound, funky music goin' 'round
Happenin' all over town, get on up and get it like you get away


I gotta move, I gotta split
I haven't got the time to sit
I gotta take what I can get and get away
I gotta jump, I gotta shout
I gotta go without a doubt
I've got to turn this sucker out and get away
Nothin' shakin' nine-to-five, nothin' but some workin' jive
If you want to stay alive you'll get away
Take a car, take a train, if you have to take a plane
Otherwise you'll go insane, so get away!
Got to get away, got to get away, get away
Listen what the people say everyday, get away
