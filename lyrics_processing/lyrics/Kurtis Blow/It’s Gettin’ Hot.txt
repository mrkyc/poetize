Every year it comes around (It's gettin' hot!)
The season when you got to throw down (It's gettin' hot!)
Don't wanna work, just gotta play
I'm gonna dance the night away

The steam is rising on the street (It's gettin' hot!)
In the dead of night you can feel the heat (It's gettin' hot!)
So grab a girl, don't stay at home
This ain't the time to be alone
It's gettin' hot, it's gettin'

It's gettin' hot!
It's gettin' hot!
