Turn the claps up
Yeah, yeah, alright here it comes
R-R-R-R-R-E-S-P-E-C-T
I tell you what I think it means to me
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
I tell you what I think it means to me
Respect is a word you have for another
The kind of a friend who would call you a brother
The kind of a lady you would call your mother
The kind of lover who would have no other
Some GAIN respect
Some LOSE respect
Some USE respect
Some REFUSE respect
And if you come in my face talkin' disrespect
I'll tell you one thing NOW, I'll kick in your chest
'Cause I'm a FRESH KID and I come from Manhattan
Making out with the ladies in the sheets and satin
Then I go downtown, then I chill in the Bronx
'Cause I'm making CASH money doing what I want
And I NEVER bite 'cause I can write my own
So ALL you sucker MCs better leave me alone
'Cause I've been around the WORLD two or three times
And YOU'RE the one who's bitin' all of MY RHYMES
I'M the trendsetter with the MC vendetta
To squash all your bugs since I'm the go-getter
And FOREVER and ever you suckers in leather
To go where I've been is a place you'll NEVER
You're over Rover, wake up and get sober
To be number one you need a four-leaf CLOVER
'Cause I'm the one who's ROCKIN' the house
So let's stop playing games of cat and mouse
'Cause I'm the  of the lion, the king of the 
And you BETTER step off because it's like that
And to the SUCKER MCs who have been mistaken
The TITLE of the king of rap is taken!
