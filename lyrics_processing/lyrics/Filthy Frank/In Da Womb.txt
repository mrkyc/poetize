You're just a fetus so it's not your birthday
There's a high chance that you won't have a birthday
Because yo mama's only sixteen
You can find me in the womb
Bathing in the fluids
It takes you nine months just to take a huge poo
Started with a pussy now my pussy is a dick, its biology
I'm susceptible to disease
You can find me in the cervix coming head first
This ain't another C section this is real birth
I'm a real fetus coming on this earth
So come give me a blanket, and a hot towel
When you see my head in the pussy coming out
I've been eating all the shit that my momma chugged down
She drank a little booze so my head is fucked up
Now, she smoke a little cigarette i got an extra thumb
My momma's from chernobyl so i got an extra head
My momma's from china ONE CHILD POLICY
My momma's from the ghetto so drink that HENNESSY
That results with ME getting a C section
My momma had protein and I get a little bigger
In the 1800's you can find me in the river
I've been dead for 2 months
I've been dead for 2 months
My only ambition is to suck on some titties
So i come out of the pussy all smelly and shitty
And the doctor slap my ass like I'm in the club stripping
I'm a fetus mother fucker don't you ever be trippin'

This ain't another C section this is real birth
I'm a real fetus coming on this earth
So come give me a blanket, and a hot towel
Yeah!
I listen to death metal
