Next nigga to fuck with me, gon' be stuck with me with his stuck ass. Bitch. Watch, look. Hold up, l-l-look, no time. Okay?

I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I

Up for hours drinking
Posted up, just reflecting on it
And I know you won't believe me
But babe, I'm cold and yeah, this life is cold
I say swear you won't come near me
Keep your heart 'cause I could fuck you up
Or have you never thinking clearly, never thinking clearly
Have you all up in your feelings
Experienced, I did it times before
And I can see you from a distance
I could fuck you now and years later on
You gon' be stuck, just reminiscing
It's the way I ride you, let you stay inside and
Yeah, I'ma fuck you like a vixen
There's something 'bout me

Swear you see the good in me
But that don't beat the hood in me
And I got my intentions and use
Guess I'm make believe
'Cause baby, I know, baby, I know

I, I'ma do you dirty
Say you love me now
But baby, it's too early
I, I'ma do you dirty
You think you love me now
I think you should be worried

Up for days, been rolling
Sweating bullets, don't regret the choices
That I made 'cause I'm still growing
Sign the deal and then they cut the check
And ever since, my color's showing
Change the scene, the things are better now
You know the wave is never slowing
The wave is never slowing
I know that you will miss it
You liked it when I used to leave a wound
And promise I would come and kiss it
I fed you lies and you just ate 'em up
And I don't care to do the dishes
I ain't no wifey, ain't gon' hold you down
It's way more fun to be the mistress
I know I'm not like other bitches
Swear you see the good in me
But that don't beat the hood in me
And I got my intentions and use
Guess I'm make believe 'cause baby, I know, baby, I know

I, I'ma do you dirty
Say you love me now
But baby, it's too early
I, I'ma do you dirty
You think you love me now
I think you should be worried

You want all my time
But I don't got enough
Baby, I can put it down
But I can't put it up
I got too much time to live
Well I'm still way too young
I'm still way too young, yeah

I'ma do you dirty
I, I'ma do you dirty
Say you love me now
But baby, it's too early
I, I'ma do you dirty
You think you love me now
