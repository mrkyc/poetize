Don't let it go, let it go
Don't let it slip away

Every man wants a queen
Like Jada in her prime 1990's fine
Gotta match his fly like something from a dream, or movie script
When you kiss her lips, should feel something like this

All of a sudden music's playing in the background
Not just any music talking Mr. Soul Child
Sparks will fly when lips first touch
All of these doubts get left in the dust
Heat of the moment so no room to judge, no room to judge

So tonight, you should go and take a chance with her
She could be everything you wanted, everything you wanted, boy
Don't let that get away
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape
Don't let that get, don't let that get away, don't let that
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape
Don't let that get away
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape

I always wondered 'bout why you let me go?
Why you let me walk, up on out that door?
We just went out for drinks
Then you took me home
Walked me to my porch
Where you turned me on

That night you told me that you heard it in the background
Not just any music talking Mr. Soul Child
Said you was scared to come fuck with me cause you see I'm chasing dreams
But that don't mean that I don't need no love

So tonight, you should go and take a chance with her
She could be everything you wanted, everything you wanted, boy
Don't let that get away
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape
Don't let that get, don't let that get away, don't let that
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape
Don't let that get away
Don't let that slip away
