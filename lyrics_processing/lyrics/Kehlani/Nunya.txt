Why you askin' 'bout X, Y, Z?
Why you worried 'bout who was fuckin' me?
Who's to the right in my SUV?
It's none of your, none of your, none of your bees
Callin' my girls to check where I been
If you needed to know, I'd drop a pin
Keepin' to yourself really ain't a sin
But you can't, you can't let me live

You put on a show
'Cause you don't want the world to know
That you lost a girl who got it on her own
It'd be good for you to let it go, let it go, let it go

Ain't nunya business (Nunya)
Ain't nunya business (Nunya)
To know who I'm with
Or none of my shit
Ain't nunya business (Nunya)
Ain't nunya business (Nunya)
To know who I'm with
Or none of my shit (None of my shit)

And his dick game thicker than you

Worry 'bout you go home to (Home to)
Worry 'bout if she gon' leave you (Leave you)
When she find out all that you do

'Cause you put on a show
'Cause you don't want the world to know
That you lost a girl who got it on her own
It'd be good for you to let it go, let it go, let it go

Ayy, I admit it, I admit
If I saved her phone number then I did it (Hello?)
It's hard when the coupe all black (Yeah)
Just left Melrose, got it waxed, done
Now I'm on the other side of the track
If the grass greener, let me know (Let me know)
These thoughts in my head, gotta let 'em out
I know it's due to the girls I let stick around
My heart on my sleeve, check the tag
It's priceless and that lil' crisis
Put me on a slight binge, had me switchin' my plans
Can't worry 'bout the past, seen you out here holdin' hands
I shoulda knew that was comin' (Why?)
I know a few that did done it (Huh?)
By my lonely when they see me 'round town
I'm all business, no feelings, not now

'Cause you put on a show (Haha)
