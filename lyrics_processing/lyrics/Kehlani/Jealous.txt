Pretty soon I'ma take your phone
Or you should hide it in yo pockets until you get home
Don't wanna see no tweets about the night we shared
Don't wanna hear reasons for it, baby I don't care
You and I both know I'm not just anybody
And I regret bringing yo ass to all those after parties
You enjoyed yourself too much and you ain't barely started
I just can't invest in shit to end up broken-hearted

You stay taking pictures, pictures
Just to show them to your bitches, bitches
So you can make 'em jealous
Now I know where your head is
Man you stay taking those pictures, pictures
Just to show them to your bitches, bitches
So you can make 'em jealous
So now I gotta dead this

So lowkey, I just stay out the way
I built a lab up in the crib so I don't leave all day
You always try to rush out when I need you to stay
But don't forget to post a pic of you with yo bae
And by the way, I see right through it
I let you slide now cause I know you not use to it
If this is the way it is, don't even put me through it
I'm quick to cut it off, if you don't believe I'll do it
