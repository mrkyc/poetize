Not cookie cutter not picture perfect
Unexpected but I'm worth it
Could expose you to this life, if that's what you like
Explore your thoughts, stop actin' scared
I could see you watching let me take it there
Let me show you what it's like, to fuck with something right
Girl let me put you on with something real
Wanna show you how it feels, to rock with something trill
So come join me in this room girl it's time
I know what you like baby, let me get you right

Oh na na, let me put you on
Oh na na na, let me put you on
Said she wanna try it, ain't tryna hide it
Fuck all of that fightin', ain't doin' no more lyin'

I start off slow so you feel secure
Just let me know where you feel it more
If your breath gets quick, that's normal
If my hands move slick, that's normal
We could smoke one first if you tryna get lit
My weed on ten come take a hit
Cause we on girl, we on
Girl let me put you on with something real
Wanna show you how it feels, to rock with something trill
So come join me in this room girl it's time
I know what you like baby, let me get you right
