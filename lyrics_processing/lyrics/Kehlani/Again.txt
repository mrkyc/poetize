Every time we drew our lines
They grew legs and walked themselves down the road
Boundaries is my middle name
I give respect where it's asked or it's shown

Something 'bout our exchange
It's a fight to act like you weren't in mind, or mine
Never want to complain, love you with your wings babe
These are your skies

But then there was the blood from your heart on my hands again
Though I swore I washed it off in the waves
And I wish I was sorry, damn I wish I was sorry
That I don't know how to stay away, stay away

Oh, if only you knew just how you taste
Oh, if only you'd seen you walk away
Oh I'd follow you into yesterday
Then miles away
And I pray for the love that we had underneath
When we both promised not to waste love arguing
I love you more than I ever could say

And something about our exchange
It's a fight to act like you weren't in mind, or mine
And I never want to complain
Love you with your wings babe
These are your skies, your skies

And there was the blood from your heart on my hands again
Though I swore I washed it out in the rain
And I wish I was sorry, damn I wish I was sorry
That I don't know how to stay away

And don't say you don't want no problems
Can't hear through what I say
Say you want it your way
Always has been your way when it comes to me
Gun play, use my heart against me always
We can't seem to hold space
No way

The blood from your heart on my hands again
Though I swore I washed it off in the waves
I wish I was sorry, damn I wish I was sorry
