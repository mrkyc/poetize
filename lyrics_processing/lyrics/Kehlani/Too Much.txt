Nigga, don't play yourself, nigga
He fuckin' with the baddest, the rawest, the realest, nigga

I know I'm not what you need
Baby, why you trying? Come over and comfort me
Ain't no sense in lying, do you deserve it honestly?
We could just part ways, find out our own destiny
Baby, baby, baby

You know I'm more than just a girl
That you can meet walking down the street
I think you know that I'm the one
That you want in your company

I'm too much of a woman
Too much of a woman
Too much of a bad ass bitch
Too much of a boss, baby, it's your loss
Now you gotta live with it
