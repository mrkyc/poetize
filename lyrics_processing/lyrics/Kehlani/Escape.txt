Never did I think I'd want you
Always seen you 'round my way
Never had the strength to tell you
I kinda, sorta think you're great
Strange for me to wanna love someone
Who's bad all by themselves
Hate to know I made you crazy for myself

'Cause I don't want you thinking
That my love's in vain
'Cause baby, I've been falling for you
But falling back up out your way

'Cause I can't let you lose yourself, looking for me
And I can't let you make me your, your everything
I just wanna be an escape, I just wanna be an escape
Baby, can we escape, escape, escape?

Admiring you from a distance
Scared to go and make a move
Didn't wanna be distracting
You be all up in your groove
It's strange for me to wanna love someone
Who's raw all by themselves
I'd hate for you to search for someone else

'Cause I don't want you thinking
That my love's in vain
Baby, I've been falling for you
But falling up on out your way

'Cause I can't let you lose yourself, looking for me
And I can't let you make me your, your everything
I just wanna be an escape, I just wanna be an escape
Baby can we escape, escape, escape?

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ayy
'Cause I've been staying low, holding back
Fighting the feelings that you've been giving
And I've been trying to put it all into words
But I can't so I'm singing

I don't want you thinking
That my love's in vain
Baby, I've been falling for you
But falling back up out your way

'Cause I can't let you lose yourself, looking for me
And I can't let you make me your, your everything
I just wanna be an escape
I just wanna be an escape
