Are you putting her on your thing?
Oh my god, I'm gonna
It's gonna be like TMZ Kehlani TMZ
And then he's gonna be suing me for slander

If this isn't love, why do I feel this way?

Why you got me so obsessed with you?
Why you got me wasting time laying next to you?
Why do you tell me, "Come over"
To watch you just stare at your phone?
Don't know why I expected you
To give me attention, affection and love
You're like a drug, never enough
Can't take your high, need a new plug
You got me bent, got me way too messed up

And I don't know why I'm even still here
Can't shake it off, I've been here for years on top of years
And I, I'm ready to, I'm ready to, be off of you
'Cause I admit, that baby, I, I just may be stuck on you

Why do I pick up my phone every time that you call?
(Why do I feel this way?)
Why do I feel this (Feel this way?)
I'm in my feelings (If this isn't love)
Why do I let you give me half then give you my all?

I'm in my feelings

(No) Uh-uh (Whoa), uh-uh (Yeah), uh-uh (Whoa)
In my feelings

Why you be doing me scandalous?
You just assume that I'm strong and can handle it
Why do you make me feel like I'm less than my worth
And it won't be for long, I ain't having it
You don't do the shit that you said would be done
You find it fun, to feel shit and run
Love like a gun, it leaves me stunned
Out on the floor and I just can't get up
And I don't know why I'm even still here
Can't shake it off, I've been here for years on top of years
And I, I'm ready to, I'm ready to, be off of you
'Cause I admit, that baby, I, I just may be stuck on you

Oh, why, why do I, why do I feel this way?
Why am I still this way?
Why after all these times, you still play all these games?
Why after all these nights, I still give you all my days?
And I don't know why I'm even still here
Can't shake it off, I've been here for years on top of years
