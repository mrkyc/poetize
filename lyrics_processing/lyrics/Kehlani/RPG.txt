You told me I'm beautiful
'Cause I told you you don't tell me enough
You're lying next to me
'Cause I told you you don't touch me enough
Now you told me you'd stay with me
'Cause I told you you've been working too much
You told me you care for me
'Cause I told you you don't show me your love

Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love, show me your love

Don't you think that we're too old to play your game?
And we ain't go through all of this to stay the same
But you can pick a player just so I can get my way (Way, way)
And I think you do this 'cause you realise I won't wait (Wait, wait)
I see right through every look in your eyes
I hear right through every fairytale lie
Won't say a word, but the stories you write
They tell me enough

And you told me I'm beautiful
'Cause I told you you don't tell me enough
You're lying next to me
'Cause I told you you don't touch me enough
Now you told me you stay with me
'Cause I told you you've been working too much
You told me you care for me
'Cause I told you you don't show me your love

Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love (Show you love), show me your love
Show me your love, show me your love (Show you love)
Show me your love, show me your love (Show you love)
Show me your love (Show, show)

I don't wanna make you think
That I'm sayin' things 'cause you prompted me
Been working with a lag, a fucked up past
I want you to be proud of me
It seems like day one, you was fond of me
Same shit I felt for you
Then I fell for you, fell in life
It's embarrassing to tell the truth
But now it's to the point where my love is up for debate
And maybe it's too late to shake
I think love is shown, you think love is spoken
And we both comin' from the same place
For every song that I write is a note to self
Note to God, note to you
Don't count me out
Besides this and my daughter, I only got love for you
I've been suppressed, I ain't the best
Roll up the problems, smoke all the stress
We got way too much shit on the line
But you can't see, emotions got you blind
Past life aggression, life time lessons, carryin' a message
Real life angels, battlin' depression
Show me your love, show me your love (Show you love)
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love, show me your love (Show you love)
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love (Show you love)
Show me your love (Show, show)
Show me your love, show me your love (Show you love)
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love, show me your love (Show you love)
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love (Show you love)
