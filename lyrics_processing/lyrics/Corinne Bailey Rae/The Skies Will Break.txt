And the heart speaks in whispers

And so it's all over
So they've already run
And we all fall down
And the clouds, they blot out the sun
Very soon your world could be different
But you've got your mind set on silence, silence, silence

The skies will break for you, my friend
The skies will break for you, my friend
The waves will part, the seas will rend
The skies will break for you, my friend
The skies will break for you, my friend
It won't be long until it ends
Singing "whoa"

But the heart speaks in whispers, you've got to listen

And the crowd is so loud
It feels like they'll drown you out
And the waves crash down
And there's chaos all around
Don't let your mind rest on violence, violence, violence

Oh, the skies will break for you, my friend
The skies will break for you, my friend
The waves will part, the seas will rend
The skies will break for you, my friend
The skies will break for you, my friend
It won't be long until it ends
Singing "whoa"

Cause the heart speaks in whispers
And the heart speaks in whispers
And the heart speaks in whispers
And the heart speaks in whispers
You've got to listen

Oh, the skies will break for you, my friend
The skies will break for you, my friend
The waves will part, the seas will rend
The skies will break for you, my friend
The skies will break for you, my friend
It won't be long until it ends
Singing "whoa"
