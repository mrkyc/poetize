Me and Candice waking up to a heat wave
Mother's in the garden inviting everyone
Ooh, we cut up our old jeans and go outside
Neighbour's always smiling with the baby on her knee
Rhea sat on the front step getting her hair combed out and greased
Music, the bass boomin' from the car parked in the street
Got that new song on repeat, oh oh
I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you
I'd, I'd like to paint a picture for you
Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from
I just like to make you see that
I desire the simple things
Growing up we didn't have a lot of money
Used to spend my summer having parties on the drive
Plastic cups for rum and punch
Eating chicken that's hot and sweet
All the women discussing what love is like
Ooh you know the way I mean
And I'm just sitting watching hoping the boys will call for me
Got that new song on repeat, oh oh
I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you
I'd, I'd like to paint a picture for you
Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from
I'm just trying to make you see that
I desire the simple things

Delicate, intimate, used to dream of someone to love
Now you come and you arrive by me
I know I'm in love
I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you
I'd, I'd like to paint this picture for you
Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from
I just like to make you see that
I desire the simple things
I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you
I'd, I'd like to paint a picture for you
Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from
I just like to make you see that
