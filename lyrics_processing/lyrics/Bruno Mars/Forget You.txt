With the girl I love and I'm like
Forget you
Oo, oo, ooo
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough I'm like
Forget you
And forget her too!
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with her
Ha,ain't that some shh (ain't that some shh)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best I'm like
Forget you!
Oo, oo, ooo
Yeah I'm sorry, I can't afford a ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess she's a xbox and I'm more of an atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
( she's a gold digger just thought you should know sugar)
I've got some news for you
Yeah go run and tell your little boyfriend

With the girl I love and I'm like
Forget you
Ooh, ooh, ooooh

Wasn't enough I'm like
Forget you
And forget her too!
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some shh (ain't that some shh)
Though there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best I'm like
Forget you!
Oo, oo, ooo
Now I know, that I had to borrow
And beg and steal and lie and cheat
Tryin to keep ya, trying to please ya
Cause being in love with you ain't cheap
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(she's a gold digger just thought you should know sugar)
(just thought you should know )
