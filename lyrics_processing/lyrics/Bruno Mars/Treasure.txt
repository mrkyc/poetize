Baby squirrel, you's a sexy motherfucker

Gimme your, gimme your, gimme your attention, baby
I gotta tell you a little somethin' about yourself
You're wonderful, flawless, ooh, you a sexy lady
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else

Oh, woah
I know that you don't know it
But you're fine, so fine (Fine, so fine)
Oh, woah
Oh, girl, I'm gonna show you
When you're mine, oh, mine (Mine, oh, mine)

Treasure
That is what you are
Honey, you're my golden star
You know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
Oh, oh, oh
