Na-na-na, here we are (Here we are)
In this big old empty room, staring at each other
Who's gonna make the first move?
Been doing our thing for a minute
And now both our hearts are in it
The only place to go is all the way
Ah-ooh

Is that alright? Is that okay?
Girl, no need to be nervous
'Cause I've got you all night
Don't you worry 'bout a thing (No, no, no)
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
