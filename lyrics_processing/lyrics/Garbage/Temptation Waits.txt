I'll tell you something
I am a wolf but
I like to wear sheep's clothing
I am a bonfire
I am a vampire
I'm waiting for my moment

You come on like a drug
(Temptation waits)
I just can't get enough
(It's in our fate)
I'm like an addict coming at you for a little more
(Can't stay much longer)
And there's so much at stake
(Temptation waits)
I can't afford to waste
(I want to stay)
I never needed anybody like this before
(Closer and stronger)

I'll tell you something
I am a demon
Some say my biggest weakness
I have my reasons
Call it my defense
Be careful what you're wishing

You are a secret
A new possession
I like to keep you guessing

You come on like a drug
(Temptation waits)
I just can't get enough
(It's in our fate)
I'm like an addict coming at you for a little more

(Temptation waits)
I never needed anybody like this before
