Things don't have to be this way
Catch me on a better day

Bury me above the clouds, all the way from here
Take away the things I need, take away my fear
Hide me in a hollow sound, happy evermore
Everything I had to give gave out long before

Fix me now, I wish you would (Fix me now)
Bring me back to life (Fix me now)
Kiss me blind, somebody should (Fix me now)
From hollow into light

Crashing silent, broken down, falling into night
Who gave up and who gave in? I'll go without a fight
A-cut me down or cut me dead, cut me in or out
And kiss me blind, time after time, take away my doubt

Fix me now, I wish you would (Fix me now, I wish you would) (Fix me now)
Bring me back to life (Fix me now)
Kiss me blind, somebody should (Kiss me now, somebody should) (Fix me now)
From hollow into light

Things don't have to be this way
Catch me on a better day

Nowhere, only down from here, pick me off the floor
Take away the things I dream, one time, one place, one more

Fix me now, I wish you would (Fix me now, somebody should) (Fix me now)
Bring me back to life (Fix me now)
Kiss me now, somebody should (Kiss me now, somebody should) (Fix me now)
From hollow into
Fix me now, I wish you would (Fix me now, somebody should) (Fix me now)
Bring me back to life (Fix me now)
Kiss me now, somebody should (Fix me now, somebody should) (Fix me now)
From hollow into light

Things don't have to be this way, catch me on a better day
Things don't have to be this way, catch me on a better day
Things don't have to be this way, catch me on a better day
