When everything is going wrong
And you can't see the point in going on
Nothing in life is set in stone
There's nothing that can't be turned around
Nobody wants to feel alone
Everybody wants to love someone
Out of the tree, go pick a plum
Why can't we all just get along?

(Boys) Boys in the girls room
(Girls) Girls in the men's room
You free your mind in your androgyny
(Boys) Boys in the parlor
(Girls) They're getting harder
I'll free your mind and your androgyny

No sweeter a taste that you could find
Than fruit hanging ripe upon the vine
There's never been an oyster so divine
A river deep that never runs dry
(What you need, what you need, what you need, what you need
What you need, what you need, what you need, what you need)
The birds and the bees they hum along
Like treasures, they twinkle in the sun
Get on board and have some fun
Take what you need to turn you on
