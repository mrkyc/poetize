Avalanche is sullen and too thin
She starves herself to rid herself of sin
And the kick is so divine when she sees bones beneath her skin
And she says:

Hey baby, can you bleed like me?
C'mon baby, can you bleed like me?

Chris is all dressed up and acting coy
Painted like a brand new Christmas toy
He's trying to figure out if he's a girl or he's a boy
And he says:

Hey baby, can you bleed like me?
Oh, c'mon baby, can you bleed like me?


Doodle takes dad's scissors to her skin
And when she does relief comes setting in
While she hides the scars she's making underneath her pretty clothes
She sings:
See Garbage LiveGet tickets as low as $56You might also like
Hey baby, can you bleed like me?
C'mon baby, can you bleed like me?

Therapy is Speedie's brand new drug
Dancing with the devil's past has never been too fun
It's better off than trying to take a bullet from a gun
And she cries:

Hey baby, can you bleed like me?
Oh, c'mon baby, can you bleed like me?


J.T. gets all fucked up in some karaoke bar
After two drinks he's a loser, after three drinks he's a star
Getting all nostalgic as he sings "I Will Survive"

Hey baby, can you bleed like me?
Oh, c'mon baby, can you bleed like me?
Hey baby, can you bleed like me?
Oh, c'mon baby, can you bleed like me?
You should see my scars
You should see my scars
You should see my scars
You should see my scars
Try to comprehend that which you'll never comprehend
Try to comprehend that which you'll never comprehend
Just try to comprehend that which you'll never comprehend
Try to comprehend that which you'll never comprehend

(You should see my scars)
La la la
