They'll come to you

They'll worship you

And there will be no apologies
And no more security
There will be no cops
Just men with guns
In their shiny black uniforms
And their big black boots
With their shiny black batons
And their sleek black cars
With their fingers on the trigger
With their fingers on the trigger
With their fingers on the trigger
And their skeleton keys

And there will be no marches
There will be no impunity
No more TV
And no more cavalcades

And no more horses, no horses
There'll be no horses, no more motorcades

There's a sky full of tears
A sky full of tears
There's a sky full of tears
There's a sky full of tears
I've been awake all night (Been awake all night)
And the sun don't shine (And the sun don't shine)
The night's so long (And the night's so long)
And the moon is in shock (And the moon is in shock)
At all the lovers turned cops
At all the lovers turned cops
Oh, all the lovers turned cops
All the lovers turned cops

And no more horses, no horses
There'll be no horses, no more motorcades
No more horses, no horses
There'll be no horses, no more motorcades
There's nothing to grieve
There's nothing to lose
There's nothing to hide
There's nothing to grow
There's nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
This is the apocalypse
This is the apocalypse
This is the apocalypse
They killed the horses
