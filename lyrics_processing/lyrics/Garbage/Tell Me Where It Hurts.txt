What is my day going to look like?
What will my tomorrow bring me?
If I had x-ray eyes, I could see inside
I wouldn't have to predict the future
I wish that you would do with some talking
How else am I to know what you're thinking?
If only people would say what it really was
What it really was, what it really was that they wanted

Tell me where it hurts
To hell with everybody else
All I care about is you and that's the truth
They don't like me
I can tell
But you do, so they can go to hell

Did they ever give you a reason
To believe in something different
If you're looking for love, for what it's worth
I have plenty of it lying around here somewhere
If you are looking for disappointment
You can find it around any corner
In the middle of the night I hold on to you tight
So both of us can feel protected

Tell me where it hurts
To hell with everybody else
All I care about is you and that's the truth
They don't like me
Yeah, I can tell
But you do, so they can go to hell

I've been loved but I didn't know how to feel it
And I've been adored but I don't know if I ever believed it
I've been loved my whole life but I didn't know how to take it
Until you

So tell me where it hurts
To hell with everybody else
All I care about is you and that's the truth
They don't like me
Yeah I can tell
But you do, so they can go to hell
But you do, so they can go to hell

Tell me where it hurts
Tell me where it hurts
Tell me where it hurts now
Tell me where it hurts
Tell me where it hurts
