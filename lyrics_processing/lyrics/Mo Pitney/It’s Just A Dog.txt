Ten years ago, I was on my way home
Saw her walking on the side of the highway alone
It was raining like hell and I kept telling myself
"Not my problem, keep on driving, just like everybody else"
Why should I be the one pulling over on the shoulder at night?
It's just a dog, right?

From the cab of my truck, to the foot of my bed
To a new pair of boots that she chewed into shreds
Digging holes in the yard, chasing cars down the street
'Til one got her and when I found her, you'da thought it hit me
It took half of my savings to save her, but I didn't think twice
It's just a dog, right?

Just an old mutt riding shotgun
Getting my seats all muddy
Just the one who I come home to
Just my best fishin' buddy

We were walking that spring in the sand on the beach
You know she was the reason Amy walked up to me
She lost her place on the couch, but she kept her cool
'Cause she was crazy about Amy and she knew I was too
And the night that girl left me, she kept me from losing my mind
But it's just a dog, right?

It's eighty-three degrees today and, man, I can hardly wait
To get this truck down to the lake, I bet the bass are hittin'
Boats in my rear view mirror, got my tackle box and all my gear
The wind is right, the sky is clear, there's only one thing missin'

Just an old mutt riding shotgun
Getting my seats all muddy
It just hit me she's not with me
Like she was this past Sunday

Why am I pulling over on the shoulder with tears in my eyes?
It's just a dog, right?
