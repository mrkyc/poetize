Where there's a hero
You'll find a villain
It is a tried and tested ost successful billing
They're in the kitchen
They're in the bedroom
They bring the world inside the home
They want to live in
As we look inside their private lives
It's really me and you
We're watching on the tube
In just one week
You'll be hooked so deep
A dairy dose of soap on the screen

This is prime time TV
A real life drama
As seen on prime time TV
You can't turn it off
And walk away

The same old story
From rags to riches
The conflicting morals of a family business
You can't predict it
No
You might also likeThe play's so twisted
Maybe that's the reason
Why it's so addictive
All the alibis and fake surprise
Will Cecil B. DeMille be turning in his grave?
But even so like the ratings show
We'll watch it once again
Every time

'Cause this is prime time TV
More real life drama
As seen on prime time TV

Yeah
Yey, yey, yey

Is it a window?
Is it a mirror?
Is it just for entertainment for pleasure?
So when it's over
We're back to people
Just to prove that human touch can have no equal
As we look inside their private lives
It's really me and you
We're watching on the tube
In just one week
You'll be hooked so deep
A dairy dose of soap on the screen
