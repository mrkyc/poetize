It's only a madness
I'm finished with this
This moment was never my joy
Who needs a heart break
Don't want anybody to call my own
But when you're near
The sweetest sensation
Takes over my heart
I feel like I'm losing control
These moments of weakness
Allow me a glimpse of heaven
But I've been so strong
Can it be true
It's like a mystery too soulful
For you broke my resolve
Now I'm fighting I try
But I cannot deny
That I could really go for you
Now I'm fighting I try
But I cannot deny
That I could really go for you
I'm through with love
It's only a madness
I'm finished with this
This moment was never my joy
Who needs a heart break
Don't want anybody to call my own
But when you're near
The sweetest sensation
Takes over my heart
I feel like I'm losing control
These moments of weakness
Allow me a glimpse of heaven
You might also likeI'm looking for clues
What else to do
I take leave of my senses
Give back all defenses
I have to comply
Can no longer deny
That I could really go for you
Oh I have to comply
Can no longer deny
That I could really go for you
Go for You
It could be so good
I'm wishing anew
Or why should I resent something I've always missed
What's the point in my pride
If I cannot deny
That I could really go for you
What's the point in my pride
If I cannot deny
That I could really go for you
I'm through with love
It's only a madness
I'm finished with this
This moment was never my joy
Who needs a heart break
Don't want anybody to call my own
But when you're near
The sweetest sensation
Takes over my heart
I feel like I'm losing control
These moments of weakness
Allow me a glimpse of heaven
I'm through with love
It's only a madness
I'm finished with this
This moment was never my joy
Who needs a heart break
Don't want anybody to call my own
But when you're near
The sweetest sensation
Takes over my heart
I feel like I'm losing control
These moments of weakness
Allow me a glimpse of heaven
I'm through with love
It's only a madness
I'm finished with this
This moment was never my joy
Who needs a heart break
Don't want anybody to call my own
But when you're near
The sweetest sensation
Takes over my heart
I feel like I'm losing control
These moments of weakness
