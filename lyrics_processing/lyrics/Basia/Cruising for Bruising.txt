Cry, come to me and cry
I know, I know, I know it's not easy, your heart is aching
But so is mine, but so is mine
How can I tell you why?
For so long, so long, so long, I've been thinking
Now I know I can't live a lie, can't live a lie

They say true love lasts forever
If we want it, there will be waiting

A second chance
Baby, but now we need time
Time to learn, time to understand
Where we went wrong 'cause I feel so strong
We are cruising for bruising, my baby
A second chance
Baby, but now we need time
Time to learn, time to understand
Where we went wrong 'cause I feel so strong
We are cruising for bruising

Go, I must let you go
Don't stop, don't stop 'cause it's better now
When I still love you
Don't say goodbye, don't say goodbye
You might also like
They say true love lasts forever
If we want it, there will be waiting

A second chance
Baby, but now we need time
Time to learn, time to understand
Where we went wrong 'cause I feel so strong
We are cruising for bruising, my baby
A second chance
Baby, but now we need time
Time to learn, time to understand
Where we went wrong 'cause I feel so strong
We are cruising for bruising

So long, so long, so long, I went away
So bye for now, don't let it die
'Cause we can try some other time
So bye for now, don't let it die
'Cause we can try some other time (some other time)
So bye for now, don't let it die (a second chance)
'Cause we can try (where we went wrong, 'cause I feel so strong)
Some other time (we are cruising for bruising)
So bye for now, don't let it die
