It's the rest of the stump, it's a little alone
It's a sliver of glass, it is life, it's the sun
It is night, it is death, it's a trap, it's a gun
The oak when it blooms, a fox in the brush
The knot of the wood, the song of the thrush
The wood of the wind, the cliff, a fall
A scratch, a lump, it is nothin' at all
It's the wind blowing free, it's the end of the slope
It's a beam, it's a void, it's a hunch, it's a cope
And the riverbank talks of the water of March
It's the end of the strain it's the joy in your heart
A foot, the ground, the flesh and the bone
The beat of the road, a slingshot stone
A truckload of bricks in the soft morning light
The shot of a gun in the dead of the night
A mile, a must, a thrust, a bump
It's a girl, it's a rhyme, it's the cold, it's the mumps
The plan of the house, the body in bed
And the car that got stuck, it's the mud, it's the mud
A float, a drift, a flight, a wing
A cock, a quail or the promise of spring
And the riverbanks talks of the waters of March
It's the promise of life, it's the joy in your heart
And the riverbanks talks of the waters of March
It's the promise of life, it's the joy in your heart
A point, a grain, a bee, a bite
A blink, a buzzard, the sudden stroke of night
A pin, a needle, a sting, a pain
A snail, a riddle, a wasp, a stain, hey
A snake, a stick, it is John, it is Joe
A fish, a flash, a silvery glow
The bed of the well, the end of the line
The dismay on the face, it's a loss, it's a find
A spear, a spike, a point, a nail
A drip, a drop, the end of the day
And the riverbanks talks of the waters of March
It's the promise of life in your heart, in your heart
And the riverbanks talks of the waters of March
It's the promise of life, it's the joy in your heart
And the riverbanks talks of the waters of March
It's the promise of joy in your heart
The end of the road, a little alone, a sliver of glass
A life, the sun, a night a death, the end of the run
And the riverbanks talks of the waters of March
It's the promise of life, it's the joy in your heart
The waters of March
The riverbanks talks of the waters of March
It's the promise of life, it's the joy in your heart
