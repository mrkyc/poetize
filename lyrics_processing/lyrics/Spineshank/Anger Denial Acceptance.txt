The way you took the life away from me
Scratched the surface of the pain to come
The separation that can't be undone
It's in the way we fuck
It's in the way you make me need
It's in the way you cry
To get just what you fucking need
It's in the way you cut
So you can see me bleed
It's in the way you see that I am
Just another face
These walls come crashing down
And now it all decays
We take the life we once embraced
It slips away
The curse of emptiness
And time will have its way
The loneliness enables us
To medicate
A beating heart that's bleeding atrophy
A broken spirits animosity
The wound inside is that which cannot heal
Destroying dreams that we will never feel
You might also likeI'm just your dead excuse
And it's a broken future now
It's not a happy ending
It's just a faded picture of
What we could never be
I can't erase the pain
The final hope has become one
We perceive to be dead
These walls come crashing down
And now it all decays
We take the life we once embraced
It slips away
The curse of emptiness
And time will have its way
The loneliness enables us
To medicate
You kill a gentle soul for personal gain
And by doing so you're a fucking murderer
This blood is on your hands
There is no light at the end of this tunnel
When I close my eyes
All I see is the dark cloud
That I protected you from
It took 90 pounds of flesh to get me here
The illusion of love
Given by all the shit surrounding me
Love is just a fucking dream
And now turned to death
Once righteous
I am now a burnt and broken man
Brought on to me by the pathetic
Excuse of a life
I'll take comfort in the dark with all of my sins
There is no return back to light
From this hell I'm in
It's fucking done!
This is never coming back, divided
Accepted the fact
That it all adds up to nothing
The anger denial acceptance, it's clear
The way you're always your own victim

Another bad decision
To trust, with my life on the line
And now I'm dead and buried
The resurrection died
Another life denied
Your hesitation wounds are showing
They show the cracks
Conscience broken
Words aren't spoken
Conscience broken
Words aren't spoken
For me, for me, it's just for me
For me, it's just for me
For me, it's just for me
She fucks him violently
It all comes to an end
