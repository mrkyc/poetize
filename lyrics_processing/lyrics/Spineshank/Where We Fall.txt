One time feel the restraint take
Disposed, pull my head away
Fall down, reject what's in front of me
But I feed the open intent
Let you relieve it
If it's what you needed to achieve it
Slow down, my breath can it feel right
But they tried to question my insight
And I start to blister without
Flowing through my tongue starts to grow
It's now retired, enter me
Come inside my empathy
It's now retired, enter me
Let it go and you will see
Would you fucking try to calm down?
What else would you put me through
While I watched what happened to you?
Now you say I need to put it all away
Your regret keeps me going
Cause you beat me to it
You tell me how I should feel
Try and stop always
Changing what you want to see
Can you keep your higher ground
When you look straight?
'Cause where we fall is where we rise
You might also likeIt's now retired, enter me
Come inside my empathy
It's now retired, enter me
Let it go and you will see
Why we fall
I look at myself
I'm feeling small
And now I fall
For all of my life, is this what you sold me?
For all of my life, is this what you sold me?
For all of my life, is this what you sold me?
For all of, all of, my life
One time feel the restraint take
Disposed, pull my head away
Fall down, reject what's in front of me
Still I feed the open intent
Let you relieve it
If it's what you needed to achieve it
Slow down my breath can it feel right
But they tried to question my insight
And I start to blister without
Flowing through my tongue starts to grow
It's now retired, enter me
Come inside my empathy
It's now retired, enter me
Let it go and you will see
Care!
Do I even fucking care? You will see
Do I even fucking care?
Do I even fucking care? You will see
Do I even fucking care?
Do I even fucking care? You will see
Do I even fucking care?
Do I even fucking care? You will see
