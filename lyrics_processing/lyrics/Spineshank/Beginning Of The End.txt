The irritation we're pretending not to show
Has replaced the motivation that I had not long ago
I know that

I, I don't ever wanna be the one to make you forget it
I, I don't ever wanna be the one to make you resent it
I, I don't ever wanna be the one to make you repress it
I, I don't ever wanna be, ever wanna be, ever wanna be

It's the beginning of the end and I
Don't know where we lost control
It's the beginning of the end and I
Know that I am all alone

Interrogation has replaced the trust we had
Your misguided accusations helping me to turn my back
I know that

I, I don't ever wanna be the one to make you divide it
I, I don't ever wanna be the one to make you deny it
I, I don't ever wanna be the one to make you deprive it
I, I don't ever wanna be, ever wanna be, ever wanna be

It's the beginning of the end and I
Don't know where we lost control
It's the beginning of the end and I
Know that I am all alone

I thought that we would find our way
I thought our life would be okay
I thought that you believed in me
But now it seems so far away

The life we knew before is gone
There is no compromising
The life you save will be your own
To find your inner senses
To find your inner senses
To find your inner senses

It's the beginning of the end and I
Don't know where we lost control
It's the beginning of the end and I
Know that I am all alone
It's the beginning of the end and I
Don't know where we lost control
It's the beginning of the end and I
