(The fallen and the deceased)
Embodied in the body
(Of a fucking liar)
You don't belong to yourself
(You haven't suffered enough)
You're like an answer
(To another fucking murder)
Show the way (God left you alone)
Find yourself (Another answer)
Your decay (Is now creating)
Venue for (Another murder)
I'll close my eyes
Just to end the this cycle
Of torture and misery
I'll close my eyes
Just to see it all go
Everything, everyone ends
I'll close my eyes
Just to end the this cycle
Of torture and misery
I'll close my eyes
Just to see it all go
Everything, everyone ends
You might also likeYou're just my endless defeat
(Another severed belief)
And now your wasted life is
(Flashing before my eyes)
It's just another attempt
(To be redeemed of yourself)
It's just another way
(To grieve the fucking murder)
Choke you out (The attention you need)
Harmless kill (Just another murder)
Your decay
A venue for (Another murder)
I'll close my eyes
Just to end the this cycle
Of torture and misery
I'll close my eyes
Just to see it all go
Everything, everyone ends
I'll close my eyes
Just to end the this cycle
Of torture and misery
I'll close my eyes
Just to see it all go
Everything, everyone ends
She, she's beautiful
But it's meaningless
The way she fakes that smile
Irrational, she's cynical
It's killing me again
Killing me again
She, well she's beautiful
But it's merciless
Because she closed her eyes
Unreachable and its terminal
She's killing me again
Killing me again
Love! Raped and afflicted
Life! Soiled and fucked beyond
Sense! Devised, perfected
Lie! Everything everyone
Ends! Everything everywhere
Ends! Everything everyone ends

Love! (Love) Your life means nothing
Love! (Love) Your life means nothing
Love! (Love) Your life means nothing
Love! (Love) Your life means nothing
Love! (Love) Your life means nothing
Love! (Love) Your life means nothing
Love! (Love) Your life means nothing
