I can never feel the way you do
But it still becomes me now
I can't take the way you do
But it's still inside me

Synthetic solution
Synthetic, I'll become
Synthetic, if it makes this go away
Synthetic solution
Synthetic, I'll become
Synthetic, if it makes this go away

Still I waste another day of my life
And it sickens me to feel this way
Now I can't make up my mind, is this right
How I let you get inside of me?

Twist my words the way that you do
Cause it falls on deaf ears now
Still, I've learned to numb your views
But they're still inside me
You might also like
Synthetic solution
Synthetic, I'll become
Synthetic, if it makes this go away
Synthetic solution
Synthetic, I'll become
Synthetic, if it makes this go away

Still I waste another day of my life
And it sickens me to feel this way
Now I can't make up my mind, is this right
How I let you get inside of me?
I will never follow you
I will never follow you
I will never follow you
I will never follow you

At this time I thought I was myself
And I thought I never could become you
All this time I thought I was myself
And I thought I never could become you
Wrong
Still I waste another day of my life
And it sickens me to feel this way
Now I can't make up my mind, is this right
How I let you get inside of me?
Still I waste another day of my life
And it sickens me to feel this way
Now I can't make up my mind, is this right
How I let you get inside of me?
I have become synthetic
I have become synthetic
I have become synthetic
