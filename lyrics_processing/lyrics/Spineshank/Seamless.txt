If you said that you could kill the things inside me
You're just a liar, everything inside me is dead
It's nice of you to think that I could ever be that
But I'm not, I'm just a failure instead

Don't preach a story of success and gifted thinking
Cause in the end we're gonna end up the same way
Keep on living your whole life on hands and knees
Cause I'll be standing waiting, life ends the same way

Never wanted this life
Because it's meaningless
Gone away from me
Never wanted this life
Because it's meaningless
Gone away from me

The life you've given is a poorly painted picture
The colors running, and it's staggering my life
Definition of the truth is all I wanted
Not mental beatings falling short of stupidity
You might also like
Don't give a speech on your prolific ways of living
You speak in vain whether you think you do or not
Spreading infection of the truth that leads to sick lies
You are the shame inside of me; you mind rot

Never wanted this life
Because it's meaningless
Gone away from me
Never wanted this life
Because it's meaningless
Gone away from me
Never wanted this life
Because it's meaningless
Gone away from me
Never wanted this life
Because it's meaningless
Gone away from me

If you said that you could kill the things inside me
You're just a liar, everything inside me is dead
It's nice of you to think that I could ever be that
But I'm not, I'm just a failure instead
Instead
I'm just a failure instead
Instead

You're so mistaken on the life you think I wanted
I'll give you credit for the effort you put forth
Cause as it ends you're gonna start to realize that
Your fucking prejudice and words of wisdom go unheard

Never wanted this life
Because it's meaningless
Gone away from me
Never wanted this life
Because it's meaningless
Gone away from me

Never wanted this life (Never wanted this life)
Never wanted this life (Because it's meaningless)
Never wanted this life
Never wanted this life (Gone away from me)
Never wanted this life (Never wanted this life)
Never wanted this life (Because it's meaningless)
Never wanted this life
