Now, I can take this, everything I know
Realize that I'm nothing I wanted to be
I can never change anything I've done
Because it's the only thing I have left
Blame myself again for what I didn't do
Never even knew it was coming from me
It changed the way I felt, the worst is yet to come
Because I have gone too far now

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Changed my mind
And it leads me to a new disease
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Let it die
But it still becomes a new disease

Is this all worth what this has done to me?
Watered down my senses and turned them on me
Fuck morality and everything I know
If I didn't hate this than I couldn't cope
Impersonate myself for what I used to be
Denial is all that's left now
You might also like
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Changed my mind
And it leads me to a new disease
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Let it die
But it still becomes a new disease
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Changed my mind
And it leads me to a new disease
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Let it die
But it still becomes a new disease

Seething in my head, I'm suffering instead
I can't remember why this meant so much to me
(Doubt!)
Did I ever want this?
It's all I could've been, it's all I would've been
(Doubt!)
Did I ever want this?
It's all I've ever been, it's all I'll ever be
Seething in my head, I'm suffering instead
I can't remember why this meant so much to me
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Changed my mind
And it leads me to a new disease
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Let it die
But it still becomes a new disease
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Changed my mind
And it leads me to a new disease
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Let it die
But it still becomes a new disease

But it still becomes a new disease
