"Hey you've called Alex
Currently can't get through to me at the moment
Just leave a message"

Sleepless nights
And these weakened eyes
Trying to keep my dreams alive
And unleash this beast inside
And they say seek you'll find
But I can't find reasons why
These demons creep and hide
Its like they wanna see me die
Have a look deep inside
And you'll see my pain
Six in the morning, i can't breathe again
I'm an eight ball down
Heart speeding away
Beating at a freakish pace
Eat sleepers as it'll ease the pain
That's the easy way
I'm aware that i need a change
Wanna vacate leave this place
But I'm back on the streets again
Back to the lean and Caine
Need to get back on my feet again
I'm drowning slowly
Trapped in the deepest wave
This crime wave, this ice age
These mind games are a blind date
Trying to fight pain these migraines won't migrate
Times change, life doesn't
Some say my times coming
Why wait when time doesn't
Why wait when time doesn't
Tryna break away
But i keep making the same mistakes
Repetitive cycle
Dead on arrival
From a baby raised this way
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I ain't
Maybe I'm just lazy
Blazin a Jay
Maybe the fame made me this way since 18
Thinking back to when i came in the game
Like this shit changed me
Now I live day to day
Wanna paper chase
Go state to state
But now I can't go back
My face is baked
D's wanna take me away today
I don't wanna be trapped in system
Slave to a cage
Actually gifted
Brains in tact and packed with wisdom
Can't waste and I have to assist with
This music shit for the listeners
Slavin' away would have paid your day
I don't wanna be back in a trap pitchin
Snakes in the grass
I left dead fakes in the past
Yo we all hit dead ends
I wanna change my path
But it feels like lately I can't
Its hard to escape my past
Trying to get away from the dark
A pain that I'm unable to mask
Now look what I'm left with
I did it all for that?
