I dress fresh to death with the Kathmandu and I got your bitch screamin like fat man 
Servin lines up and down like a 
Lleyton Hewitt in this rap shit, my backhand's huge
Name a time and place, you get your head smacked
The Jacks will find ya face disfigured with ya neck snapped
All I see is fakes tryna wreck rap, dumb it down and even Brian Lake couldn't defend that
Yeah you alright but you bore me, you're corny
I got me interest, I'm somethin like Westpac
I'm on a rise like a jetpack, flyby get that, I'm blowin up like a meth lab
I'm a lion you a little man, the mini middle man, makin my money measured up in milligrams
Beat killer, I'm an open hitman, token six grams leanin like broken kicks 

Here we come through
It's Flea and Karma bringin the drama
Microphone check, one, two
Understand you can't compete with a master
X2

Angry that my stomach is bloating so I act and I don't think
This pill here is stronger than most things
Was meant to have half but I swallowed the whole thing
And mixed it with acid and a couple of bottles of codeine
Or token on a nice pipe and blowin a smoke ring
He's so hot he's smoking, rockin back and forth like he's stuck on a rope swing
Sayin I'm sane would just not be true
I gotta lot to do but don't know what to do
I'm still lookin for my mind cause I've lost it too
I need a doctor soon but you probably knew from the convulsions true
It's been an  off the prostitutes
So fried and high I'm rockin the right socks and odd shoes
I'm endin ya life with this pen as a slice like the edge of a knife across ya neck till you die
