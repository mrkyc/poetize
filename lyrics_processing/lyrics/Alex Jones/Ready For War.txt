And I will feel no pain
I will feel no shame
When I go down
I'm ready for war

I'm ready for war like Americans killin Viets in '74
You beefin? Come down no numbers needed, let's settle the score
I'm the general of war  bow down lieutenant
I'm steadily movin forward he talks and I cut his movement short no cerebral palsy
Cause I ain't into the empty threats and I ain't into reppin a street cred
Even with the MTs I keep my steez fresh, that's why head c respect me to the death
But if war comes, knock knock, I run a 
I ain't lettin my mouth run at the cop shop
Get your mouth locked shut all my mates locked up cause they ain't gettin on the dog when the cops come
So I'm militant minded, lyrically wiped, criminal life's hidden behind it
So I ignore the law when enter an enemy territory I ain't talkin forwards
I just spit verbal weaponry, I'm raw to the core
I'm regularly movin more than a cornerstore
I regularly wreck a track, all enemies better be steppin back
Prepare to be takin shots like Kennedy or Hennessy when I mentally snap
I'm gettin my energy back I'm a te-terror you terribly rap
Get ready to be turned to a memory, put in a hole like ketamine trap
Melbourne you heard I'm a raw beast
Welcome to World War Three

And I will feel no pain
I will feel no shame
When I go down
I'm ready for war
And I will play this game
And you'll all know my name
When I go down
I'm ready for war

It's over, this is closure
Listenin to missionin position soldier
Spittin cold no cliffs unfold but got shit concealed like clips in holsters
Big shoulders training for war I may be crazy breakin your jaw
I'm an M80 aimed at your porch, spit insanely bloodstained on your door
I'm hating the law still run for my country
Knock you off the wall humpty dumpty
Guns forth  love my money, love my rum and love to be grumpy
See the enemy they pull a sin then the boom begins when we pull the pin
Pull wool from skin at night to stay warm
Turned alcoholic couldn't stop it I stay gone
