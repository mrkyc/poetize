This is my life

I spend my days paranoid as death looms in a stress room visionin a picture of my next move
Listenin to hail or raindrops, sippin syrup in the night time till the pain stops
Catch that spliff on my right hand man, scratch that, my spliff's my right hand man
I cut bricks like a Japan man's hands
Doin hand to hands movin gram for gram, damn fam
I'm pullin pills out my sock drawer, why these gimmicks won't stop bitin, locked jaw
I needa kickback like a dropsaw but I already put in work why I need a job for?
Tryna find another way on a Summer's day only coins in my pocket still can't see the fuckin change
I wanna break away today, shake the pain, I guess life's one big paper chase ya know

This is my life smoke the best weed
This is my life tryna get clean
This is my life I dress in fresh steez
This is my life I need to be set free
This is my life the mistakes and memories
This is my life, my face, my destiny
It's fake I'ma make it eventually straight past the gates and the haters and enemies

Don't be ignorant to the rhymes kids cause I tried being like you and I didn't like it
See I've been tryna find a way through this maze, blaze from the haze, spendin days in a daze
It's day to day shit, surrounded by fake shit
Face it we all livin in a spaced out matrix
See these people prayin on my downfall so I drop a mixtape and bounce back, downball
But haters gazin at my cocky stare they all claimin I'm whack they only playin emselves, solitaire
See money come and go I'm tryna maintain with a hundred foes rhymin on my A game
Whack rappers are plastic as their fake chains
Old style bit and they puttin it on, weight gain
But I ain't gonna change my ways I'll find a way to remain the same till I change the game
Cause


I remember the years sippin makers mark, clicks smokin cones a brick makin 
Train tracks mat blacks and two sets of clothes, them dumb jacks never left us alone
From hockin weed to robbin sprees, sittin drunk as fuck and startin shit down Colin Street
Alarms ringin in a shop, run, grab a few box and bow before the cops come
See it's the life I love, the crime, the drugs, the lines, the buds, the rhymes, the mic that I clutch
Don't underestimate me, play ya cards right cause I back up what I say like my brain's a harddrive
Blurred vision lookin at my glass empty as I'm reminiscin on past memories
Flea the only son that the devil sent
Lgeez, M20s, Melbourne City represent!
