These are Codeine Dreams
The quicker they flicker, the slower they seem
The moment I sleep, I can see it right there
I'mma paint a picture of a nightmare

(VERSE)
You ever wake up in the middle of a dream?
Half leaned out, trynna figure what you seen
Picture this, I'mma paint it as vivid as digital images
You can bare witness to the killings in the screens?
I hear a voice I don't recognise
Be aware cuz these boys might testify
Only one thing playing on my empty mind
There's gonna be one dog dead tonight
Gotta stay smart, creep up by his main yard
Spend a couple weeks, sus it like a train yard
Facemask, yeah the crew ran it by me?
I guess I'd be one to do it, but that wouldn't satisfy me
That would defeat the purpose
They saying money talks, in this case, speaking is worthless
So when I'mma speak, I'mma speak with a purpose, and
If I say I'll do something, I'll mean it for certain
You might also likeBut let's scratch deeper than the surface
Come into my dreams and you don't need to be nervous
Voices in my head, saying leave it, you just hurtin'
Everytime I'm prey, I see demons in my churches
Hot-headed, heated like a furnace
I just wanna leave 'em leakin' and murdered
Now I'm stuck in limbo, they say it's pre-determined
Guilty as hell, Satan readin' out my verdict
Burnin' infinite flames, he took my soul
Now I'm wishin' I was six feet in a wooden hole
He got a grip, but I slipped, then he took control
Livin' his highway, I guess it took it's toll
Let's take it back to the present time
I can see the future vivid, got that 2020 sight
I see a dead man walkin', petrified
Re-occurin' dreams of the same scene every time
Nevermind, death to my enemy's
Talk behind my back, cause they'll never be ahead of me
I'mma get him on his own, with his bitch
And this gronk still tickin', I don't know where he lives
And now we're creepin' closer to the time this ends
One word stuck up in my mind, revenge
You startin' to see the picture? My heart's beatin' quicker
So it's one two, run through the dark to getcha all
Bally'd up, xanny'd up. Flip the bed, slap him up
Take him for a joy ride, drop him in the Yarra brus
Says he has had enough. Let him go
If he didn't want an episode, don't assassinate my character
The time has come, the end is near
Your life is done, it's ending here
Then I wake up sweatin', blood all on my sheets
The devil's taking over, I'mma motherfuckin' beast

(HOOK)
These are Codeine Dreams
The quicker they flicker, the slower they seem
The moment I sleep, I can see it right there
