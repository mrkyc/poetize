It's my time again
Rest in peace, Gargoyle

I still can't escape
Soul is crying, heart full of pain
Cold as ice, roll the dice
The cards that I did play had an impact
Looking back to the start of my darkest days
Look in a mirror and see half my face
I wanna go back, let's start this again
'Cause friends and fam, they keep passing away
I been impatient
Dreams, I'm chasing keep me awake in
The evening, wasted, weed and papers
Jim Beam, don't need them chasers
Stinking of reefer
Big spliff with a script for a sleeper
Sober or not, I'ma smoke till I drop
All over the shop like ink in a beeper
I deserve what I got
Earnt my spot, work like a boss
Back then they used to say I worthless
 verses wasn't worthy to work with
What? I could've turned and stopped
But it just made me more determined to murder
Every word and prove these vermin's wrong
Now have a look who's first to the top
Told me sky was the limit
I disagree, my high's infinite
I been putting in time for a minute
You clock that watch, don't have time to re-live it
And my eyes look squinted off half a jay
Half awake, tryna mask it with Prada shades
And looking back to my past and my darker days
I think that it's about time that a karma came
So I left it at that
Changed shit around, put pen to a pad
Took a bit of time for my head to adapt
 V/Line flow, express on a track
Ha, gotta take control
Can't let another man break your soul
Do it my way, reshape that mould
I guess the highway's gonna take its toll
But I'm riding by
It's my time to shine, yeah, I got the goods
My future's calling, I'll answer it
And I won't hang it up till I'm off the hook
They stop and look when they spot the crook
Wanna photo, the fans they're like fiends
Nodded to the beat like rock or kush
Got a flow so dope that I got them hooked
Dropped the line, reeled 'em in
There's plenty fish in the sea
It's over your head what is hidden beneath
But the underground couldn't be digging this deep
Seen  me ripping a beat
Tryna live it to the limit with an infinite peak
I'ma seek wisdom on a 
Spit in my sleep, I'm literally living my dreams
It's a journey the further I got
I'm still the same person I was
Be with the same circle forever
We stick together like birds in a flock
This shit is my life
I couldn't make up this shit if I tried
We all living to die
I'm tryna connect with similar minds
So I went away for a minute
Took a little break from spitting
Had to find who I was
Reshape my way of thinking
Your future defines your past
The presence, a gift I rap
So I changed my train of thought
Now I'm on a different track
Yeah, shit got grimey
Two words for the pigs: find me
Keep moving forward
Not taking a glimpse behind me
Misfit to society
It's sink or swim in this psyche
Through thick and thin, the thickest skin
This clique that stick beside me
From start to end
Beginning to finish, you passed your friends
And I can't forget, we brothers in arms
The love in my heart is hard as cement
Drop got 'em on hype again, live again
Yep, it's my time again
Got the mic in my left, eyes looking red
Don't know whether I'm right in the head
So let's sip and we smoke
My head's tripping off both
That pen's inking my flows
My head's sinking in slow
Come enter into my dome
What the f you think that you know?
They let me into my zone
Damn near led the king to the throne

But let's get one thing clear
I ain't gonna dumb shit down
Even keeping it underground
Tell the haters, I run this town
But let's get one thing clear
I ain't gonna dumb shit down
Even keeping it underground
Tell the haters, I run this town

It's what...
I think...
Bite tongue, deep breaths
It's what...

Bite tongue, deep breaths
It's what...
