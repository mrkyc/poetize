Stuck on a roller coaster, last year was a crazy ride
I stared death in the eyes and got a close mate facing life
I lost friends and family, I've been through hell and back
I'm still burning certain that I know where the devil's at
In the flats, in and out traps
Junkies bunch up picking up smack, In amongst packs, living off scraps
Sleep deprived young mum ticking up crack
I miss madness and picture blackness, light comes and goes in patches
Rich bankers, sick wankers, see suits and ties fit gangsters
They got shit controlled, think about how them rocks get sold
Aye, it's not what you're told, make a drug bust problem solved
The war on drugs are the corporate thugs, filling up stock with the pots of gold
You know what I mean, pseudo, codeine, purified back to hot and cold
The problem lies in a system, no truth just lies in the system
Another young mum dies in the system, Found with the brown and the white in her system
In the innocent eyes of an infant, there's a victim
They've gotta live with the stress and the pain, it's inflicted upon em
They left him this way didn't give him a option
Picture his future to sit by a coffin
Blind all the time so his vision is lost, give him a pill to get rid of his problems
Then he get addicted this shit isn't stopping
Chin up, don't give up, it gets cold when your living in the winter
At war with my inner, I point at the mirror
I can't reflect if I'm pulling the trigger, forgive I've been up, I'm just a sinner
Thinking that's Gods call you tryna ring up
Devil on my shoulder telling me to tick up
How do I answer though? Do I pick up?
Stuck in a cycle where nothing is final, an animal kingdom we hunt for survival
Toking the roach of a blunt and the bible
I aim for the top and I come for your title
Thinking that this is it, feel like a hypocrite all that I know is the mark of the beast
Praying it's something that I don't believe in and hoping they give me the answer I seek

I'm still searching, I'm still searching
To find a way out of the struggle
I'm still searching, I'm still searching
For the light at the end of the tunnel
I'm still searching, I'm still searching
