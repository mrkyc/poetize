(Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay)

Okay, soon as I stepped in the club
I hit up the back, show my nigga some love (Love)
Hit the restroom up when I'm finished
I seen some bird I ain't seen in a minute
She's like "Banks, where've you been honey?"
What it look like bitch? Gettin' this money
Buyin' more clothes, I look nice right?
You be in that fake shit, and I seen yours twice
Your shoes, your weave and your purse
If you're bad, believe that I'm worse (Yep)
You be online doing mad research
Tryna cop some shit she's seen me in first (Yeah)
Yeah, I make this way too easy
You can watch me more than your TV
Make sure she see, I'm the main bitch on the show like Mo
Y'all Kim and Niecy

'Cause I give all them competition
They don't even deserve my attention
And she can leave before her entrance
I don't give a fuck 'bout none of y'all bitches
(And I don't give a fuck 'bout none of y'all bitches)

I wanna get drunk, I'm tryna get lit
I wanna get fucked, I'm tryna get picked
These bitches lookin' like they wanna get hit
Razor or the taser, take your pick
Feelin' outspoken and I'm hopin' you speak
'Cause my homegirl hopin' she can open your cheek
Think twice 'fore you open your beak
'Cause you can get buck fifty then your face'll be open for weeks
But I breaks no sweat, no Keith
Bitches always got my name up in they mouths like teeth
Do treat treat in the chic boutiques
And her shoes and her blouse look cheap (Aha)
Baby girl hair so brown but her weave look black (Yep)
Bitches on I'm mean 'cause I seen their tracks
Lip gloss caked up and her make-up baked up
Baby girl, did you just wake up?
Bitches need to get their cake up
But these smuts got nut in the gut and it's so, so saved up
Real shit, she's the Krasdale version
Dust bunnies under rugs like Persian, but because

I'm here, and if you're poppin' that sick shit
Bitch, I'm right here (Oh, yeah)
We be sippin' and trippin', you know mine's clear (Yep)
I would let you come toast but we don't like beers
No, no
'Cause I give all them competition
They don't even deserve my attention
And she can leave before her entrance
