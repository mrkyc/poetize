Fire burn again
Dem can't escape
There's no where to run again
Knowing dis
My daughters and my son again, yea
Let Jah rise
All his enemies scatter
Blessed is the man who walks not in the council of the wicked, nor stands in the ways of sinners, nor shall be seated with scornful
Righteousness exalts a nation; sin is a reproach to any man or any people
Love Jah and livity, man done, uh! boom!
Jah is my lifeline
Protect me from the plagues there in the nighttime
Always make my light shine
Be in the right place at the right time
No go tell me say fi fight crime
Live good and have a nice time
Don't lock off the pipeline
I'm quite fine
Chorus:
I know someday
Jah is gonna set us free
From all this misery
I knew it's true
No matter what they say or do
Jah is gonna see us through
You might also likeShow love not only sometime
Tell the youths ah overcome time
Make hay while the sun shine
Nuh fall in-a captive and go done time
Tell them a fire burn time
Burn the war and burn the gun crime
Flattering lips a wit dem tongue line
Tell them fi come listen to me punchline

I know someday
Jah is gonna set us free
From all this misery
I knew it's true
No matter what they say or do
Jah is gonna see us through
Said if you feel like nuttin nah gwaan
Still give thanks for the day when you born
Keep the faith and live on
Harm no one and you won't be harmed
Nah bad, nah gun ya hol', no man a go bomb
Nah make no pagan come grease your palm
After the storm it must be a calm

I know someday
Jah is gonna set us free
From all this misery
I knew it's true
No matter what they say or do
Jah is gonna see us through
Jah keep my light shinin (Shining bright)
Seek and search and you will find it (Find your light)
Everything takes timing
Mountain steep; tell dem I'm still climbing
Don't have your sight and act blindin
Babylon time unwindin
Sell you out for nickel and dimin
See dem with plastic smiling

I know someday
Jah is gonna set us free
From all this misery
I knew it's true
No matter what they say or do
