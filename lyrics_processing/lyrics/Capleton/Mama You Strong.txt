Cause Mommy haffi hol' a Jah Jah fi keep her tranquil
Mi respect Mommy inna di days she had di skill
When Daddy couldn't find money fi facilitate di bill
She never fulfill from no handout, she a chill
She say where there's a way there must be a will
She nuh come fi breakdown, she only come fi build
I tol' her that should follow more than a quatrillion zill
And I fear, nervous upon di will
Mi wish her everliving life, she never get kill

Remember the days of the cradle?

Well Daddy is a man who's sometimes unstable
Anyway yuh know him is a ol' rebel
Always a talk 'bout yuh miserable
Always a talk 'bout yuh terrible
But one ting him couldn't a call yuh nuh devil
'Cause it a you take it to another level
Make sure di yout' dem live comfortable
Make life possible, you never tremble
