Pon dem hand, pon dem foot I just see shackles and chains
Now dem take it off and put it pon dem brain
Through dem ah mi nation fi go down the drain
Now the youths dem realize and shout the hailie hailie name
Man no pet lion dat mean we can't tame
One thing is our desire one thing is our aim

Dem nah teach me nothin' 'bout mi Asian plan
Inna the school and the college and the institution
The curriculum that I get is European
Ah teach me bout Marco Polo and Napoleon
Nah teach me nothin' 'bout the river Nile bank
Where civilization it began
You say thou shall not steal and should not kill no one
Still you steal treacheries and then you teach wrong
Yea, yea slave and you murder all mi dad and mi mom
But wicked Babylonian and you will love to burn
Babylon ah
Tell dem come down, fire bun all politician
Ah causin' dispute makin' us their plan
Oh your dishonesty and war is their illustration
Competin' this is more than competition
Could that dem fightin' just to enslave black man
And now dem parties just ah cause bear partition
