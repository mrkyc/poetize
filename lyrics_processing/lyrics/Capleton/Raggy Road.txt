Jah! Rastafari...
And I saw an I-ngel ascended from the East
Having the seal of the living King, Emperor Haile Selassie I the first
The Most High
And He cried out with a loud voice, sayin'
Oh oh...

It's a raggy road
The road is so rough
A raggy road
The road is so tough
A raggy road
Road is so rough
Raggy road

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, I've been troddin' this road for the longest while
And mi career nuff of dem want fi soil
Hey, hey
Troddin' this road for the longest while
And never yet try pop off all another man's coil
Troddin' this road for the longest while
A long time, David house, and dem no stop till the soil
Troddin' this road for the longest while
And give away more than 1/10th of the spoil
Troddin' this road for the longest while
And still my lamp never run out of oil
