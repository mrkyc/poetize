Everybody-ody-ody-ody
Needs somebody-ody-ody-ody
Everybody-ody-ody-ody

Somebody to love
Somebody to kiss
Somebody fi come cool down your body when it fit

The other day outta mi gate, upon mi bottom weh me sit
Me look down the road, me sight a sexy little chick
She coming up the road, she look so outlandish
Her bumper cock off and her breast stand up stiff
Me like her figure, she got a nice little hip
28, 32, and 36
Me just step down beside her without any resist
And said, "Hi there, come here, me love your cherry lips"
"A girl like a you, me surely wanna kiss"
Nuh pon her jawbone me fling half dozen kiss
And inna her ears me talk some conscious lyrics
That's why me tell unuh say

Me tell her inna mi kitchen me have  a pot a lick
Hear her nuh, "What's the menu Caple', make me hear it?"
Hear me, rice and peas, and ackee and saltfish
Fruit, and carrot, and pop chow, and lettuce
Hot pepper, sweet pepper, tomato, and Irish
Onion, and scallion, and thyme, and garlic
And pumpkin, cucumber, and turnip
A jug of sour sap juice with nuff ice inna it
That's why me holler out

She push out her tongue and then she lick off her lip
And she say, "Lord Massa, me can't wait fi taste it!"
What you're waiting for? Now, let's move to it!
Now on fi mi way fi go prepare mi dish
Nuh down inna mi alper, mi settee, she sit
Now something fi drink fi her body feel fit
Me just inna the buffet, take out the puss stiff
And give the gyal the liquor, tell her fi drink it
And I'm off to the kitchen to prepare the dish
Sametime me hear a voice say, "Capleton, come yah quick!"
Me haffi fling 'way the fork, the spoon, and the dish
And run inna the house without any resist
A that, me sing it out

One piece of surprise, she say she feel fit
She say, "Yes, Capleton, me waan you kill me with lick"
But big, big surprise weh the gyal see me with
One piece of surprise, she start get panic
She start to scratch up herself like when cow have ticks
A hawk and spit like when puss have ticks
She a squeaky, squeaky, squeaky, mi say, "Lord, a wha' this?!"
And make some funny sound like rabbit and cricket
That's why me holler out
