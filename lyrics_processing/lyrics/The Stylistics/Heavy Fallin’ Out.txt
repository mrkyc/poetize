Shake you up and turn your world around, my love
Lots of things in life, it's true, you can do without
But baby, baby, once you fall in love
It's heavy fallin' out
Heavy fallin' out
Heavy fallin' out, heavy fallin' out
Once you fall in love, it's heavy fallin' out
It's life's necessity, without it what's it all about?
But baby, baby, once you fall in love
It's heavy fallin' out
Heavy fallin' out
I can give up drinkin', that's okay, my love
I can quit my smoking any day, my love
Anything the devil sells I can dwell without
But baby, baby, once you fall in love
It's heavy fallin' out
Heavy fallin' out
Heavy fallin' out, heavy fallin' out
Once you fall in love, it's heavy fallin' out
It's life's necessity, without it what's it all about
But baby, baby, once you fall in love
