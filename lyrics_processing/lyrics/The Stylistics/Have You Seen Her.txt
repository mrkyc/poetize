One month ago today
I was happy as a lark
But now, I go for walks
To the movies..maybe to the park
I have a seat on the same old bench
To watch the children play
You know, tomorrow's their future
But for me, just another day
They all gather 'round me
They seem to know my name
We laugh, tell a few jokes
But it still doesn't ease my pain
I know I can't hide from the memories
Though day after day I've tried
I keep saying, "She'll be back.."
But today again I've lied ?
Chorus
Oh...I see her face everywhere I go
On the street and even at the picture show
Have you seen her?
Tell me have u seen her?
OH I hear her voice as the cold winds blow
And the sweet music on the radio
Have u seen her?
Tell me have u seen her?

Oh, I've been used to havin someone to lean on
And I'm lost
Baby I'm lost
Have u seen her?
Tell me have u seen her??
Have u seen her?
Tell me have u seen her??
She left her kiss upon my lips
But left the break with in my heart
Have you seen her?
Tell me have you seen her?
Oh I see her hand reaching out to me
Only she can set me free
Have you seen her?
Tell me have you seen her?
Why, oh why did she have to leave and go away?
Oh yeah
Oh, I've been used to havin' someone to lean on
And I'm lost
Baby I'm lost
Have you seen her?
Tell me have you seen her?
(spoken):
As another day comes to an end
I'm lookin' for a letter, or something
Anything that she would send
With all the people that I know, I'm still a lonely man
You know, it's funny:
I thought I had her in the palm of my mind
Have you seen her?
Tell me have you seen her?
Have you seen her?
Tell me have you seen her?
