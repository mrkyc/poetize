All of my lonely life I've dreamed of you (Dreamed of you)
You're like a fairy tale, a wish come true
So many times I try to let you know I'm glad you're mine
But still, you're so afraid someday I'll go, use your head

'Cause I love you
(Can't you see I'm in love with you?)
Why would I leave you?
(Can't you see I'm in love with you?)
If I love you
(Can't you see I'm in love with you?)
Why would I leave you?
(Can't you see I'm in love with you?)

Maybe I failed to make you understand (Understand)
How much you mean to me, you're a part of every plan
In every way you've helped me through the problems of each day
Why can't I make you see that you're my life, you're part of me?

'Cause I love you
(Can't you see I'm in love with you?)
Why would I leave you?
(Can't you see I'm in love with you?)
If I love you
(Can't you see I'm in love with you?)
Why would I leave you?
(Can't you see I'm in love with you?)
