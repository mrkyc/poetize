In two more years, my sweetheart, we will see another view
Such longing for the past for such completion
What was once golden has now turned a shade of grey
I've become crueller in your presence

They say, "Be brave
There's a right way and a wrong way"
This pain won't last forever
This pain won't last forever

Two more years, it's only two more years
Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years, so hold on
Two more years, it's only two more years
Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years, so hold on

You've cried enough this lifetime, my beloved polar bear
Tears to fill a sea, to drown a beacon
To start anew all over, remove those scars from your arms
To start anew all over, more enlightened

I know, my love
This is not the only story you can tell
This pain won't last forever
This pain won't last forever

Two more years, it's only two more years
Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years, so hold on
Two more years, it's only two more years
Two more years, there's only two more years
Two more years, so hold on

You don't need to find answers
(Two more years)
For questions never asked of you
(Two more years)
You don't need to find answers, no
(Two more years, so hold on)
You don't need to find answers
(Two more years)
For questions never asked of you
(Two more years)
You don't need to find answers, no
(Two more years, so hold on)
Dead weights, balloons
Drag me to you
Dead weights, balloons
To sleep in your arms
Dead weights, balloons
(I've become crueller)
Drag me to you
(Since I met you)
Dead weights, balloons
(I've become rougher)
To sleep in your arms
(This world is killing me)

And we cover our lies with handshakes and smiles
(Two more years)
And we try to remember our alibis
(Two more years)
We tell lies to our parents, who hide in their rooms
(Two more years, so hold on)
We bury our secrets in the garden
Of course, we could never make this love last
(Two more years)
I said, of course, we could never make this love last
(Two more years)
The only love we know is love for ourselves
(Two more years, so hold on)
