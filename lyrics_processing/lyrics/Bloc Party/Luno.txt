And you're tired of your mum and you're tired of your dad
Got you jumping through hoops, got you shaving your legs
Let it pass, let it pass, let it pass over you
And you're tired of your face and you're tired of your nose
Got you jumping through hoops, got you shaving your legs
Let it pass, let it pass, let it pass through you

And your nose is bleeding
And your nose is bleeding
You've been lying to me
And your nose is bleeding
And your nose is bleeding
You've been lying to me

There will be no hesitation, there will be no confrontation
There will be no indication, there will be no cause
There will be no exultation, there will be no justification
There will be no way at all

And your nose is bleeding
And your nose is bleeding
You've been lying to me
And your nose is bleeding
And your nose is bleeding
You've been lying to me

I can heal the blind, I can cure the sick
I can heal the blind, I can cure the sick
I can say the right things, I can say the right things
Where'd you get so cruel? Where'd you get so cruel?
Where'd you get so cruel? Where'd you get so cruel?
Where do you go? 'Cause you're never here
