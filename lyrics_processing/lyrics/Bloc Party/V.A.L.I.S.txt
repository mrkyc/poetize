When in motion
A world is frozen
Talks in circles and Greek
He's into epiphany
He's into philosophy
He's into methyl amphetamines
He's into science
But he's lost his way
Oh-oh

He is not the real me
But I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear him
From my future

(Show, show, show, show me)
(Show, show, show, show me)
You've gotta show me the way
(Show, show, show, show me)
(Show, show, show, show me)
You've gotta show me the way
(Show, show, show, show me)
(Show, show, show, show me)
You've gotta show me the way, hey
(Show, show, show, show me)
(Show, show, show, show me)

Past and the present are superimposed
He has seen this before
He's into conspiracy
He's into theophany
He's into phenomenology
He's into deeds
He don't mix his words
Oh-oh

He is not the real me
But I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear him
From my future

You've gotta show me the way
