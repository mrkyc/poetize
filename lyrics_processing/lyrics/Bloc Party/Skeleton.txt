All my thoughts are of ice
All my thoughts are of ice
All my bones are so tired
All my bones are so tired
So young and so handsome
So easily led
They told me to wait
I said

He makes a man out of me, he makes a man out of me
He makes a man out of me, he makes a man out of me
You take the fun out of me, you take the fun out of me
You take the fun out of me, you take the fun
And I've been consistent to the fucking dream
And I've paid my dues just to get them all back
A simple man with simple desire

What should I have said?
What should I have done?
The horses are here
The damage is done
So just take off your shirt
And just take off your dress
We can go dancing
On a Saturday

You take the fun out of me, you take the fun out of me
You take the fun out of me, you take the fun
And I've been consistent to the fucking dream
And I've paid my dues just to get them all back
A simple man with simple desire

I'm just a skeleton
I'm just a skeleton
I'm just a skeleton
I'm just a skeleton
And I've been consistent to the fucking dream
And I've paid my dues just to get them all back
A simple man with simple desire
I'm just a skeleton

I'm just a skeleton
