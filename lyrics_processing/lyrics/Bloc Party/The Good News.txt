Spent my commission on another diversion
And I don't got no meaning, no purpose left at all
My pastor tells me that my, my light is dimming and I've
Been too long drifting in a ocean
It's OK, you just need faith
Been looking for answers in the wrong place
But how do I tell him that there, there's something missing?
And I don't got no substance since you've gone

Every day I go down to the water
And I pray since you left me that way
Oh Lord, I'm trying to keep my mind
On the good news that's in my heart

For the good, good news, for the good, good news
For the good, good news, for the good, good news
For the good, good news, for the good, good news
Since my baby left, my light refuses to shine
Like a bird without a song or a sun that will not rise

Now I can make the eyes at anyone that I desire
Throwing down with all the lost boys at the very edge of town
Now I can spin a lie that binds me up all through the night
Cause I've got no one home to answer to this time
Every day is a repeat
Like a carrier bag stuck in a tree
I used to find my answers in the gospels of St. John
But now I find them at the bottom of this shot glass

Every day I go down to the water
And I pray since you left me that way
Oh Lord, I'm trying to keep my sights
On the good news that's in my heart

For the good, good news, for the good, good news
For the good, good news, for the good, good news
(Don't got no meaning and I don't got no purpose)
For the good, good news, for the good, good news
(Can't find no comfort and I can't find no solace)
Since my baby left, my light refuses to shine
