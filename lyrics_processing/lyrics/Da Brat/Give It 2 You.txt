Three to get ya goin'

Yeah

It's me, the O.G. funk bandit (Who's that?)
The B to the R-A-T and in fact
If you ain't heard of me, take a seat, lay back and listen
As I bust for your ass on this funkdafied mission
Just kick off your shoes and relax your feet (That's right)
Party on down with Da Brat and her beat
Now it goes like that and that's how it goes
I'ma give it to all you negroes and hoes
So listen up, make sure you listen up well
And don't miss shit 'cause this bitch be bad as hell
Truth of matter is I splatter kids that talk shit
In a gangsta's way, that's how them fools get dealt with
So want you wanna do, bitch? Don't even trip
Step up, step up and I'ma bust your lip
Now I know that you know that I know you don't want me to
But keep on trippin' and I'ma give it to you, bitch

Brat is the fantastic, romantic, single-handed
Bandit, and damn it
Don't get no better, better it don't get no more
Than the flow that I flow for you negroes and hoes
Devastating, captivating, elevating as I
Smooth operating and I love to get high
Well, nigga, fire up (Say what?), nigga, fire it up
At your request I guess it's time for me to get fucked up
It goes one puff, two puff, three puff, four
From the bottom to the top, top to bottom I go
So now you know, what I ain't and what I is
It's the baddest new bitch in this hip-hop biz
O.G. Is what I am, a brat is what I be
Blunts are what I smoke and you can't see me
So let it go, 'cause my shit is tight
Take it how it give it and enjoy the night

I'm gonna give it to you (Yeah, it's like that, to you)
For the nine-fuckin'-four, it's Da Brat
