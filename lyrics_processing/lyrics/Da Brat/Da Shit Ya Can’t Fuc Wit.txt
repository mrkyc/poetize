I promise the funk, the whole funk and nothin' but the funk
Yo ho!
(Word)

I be Da B-R-A-T, the new lady
Wit' da shit ya can't fuck wit'
I be Da B-R-A-T, the new lady
Wit' da shit ya can't fuck wit'

Uh, fool, sittin' all fat
Brat-tat-tat-tat (Bitch, and it's like that)
Well, let me lift you to the sky (Let me lift you to the sky)
Just climb aboard the B-R-A-T ride
Those with no love, I stay above like God
Quick to pull ya trigger, nigga, quick to pull ya card
And it don't stop and it don't quit
In ninety-fo', I be the sho-shot shit
And in years to come, shit ain't gonna change
So So Def, you know the name of the game
And those that say they don't, nigga, bitch, please
'Cause we be known for makin' dem G's
Settin' them swole, steady, going gold
Whatever we release, whatever we unfold
So now you know in ninety-fo' who's the shit
And who's got the shit dat you just can't fuck wit'

Well yo, I ain't no joke, never have, never will be
Down your whole block you can feel me
All I do is keep fucking it up
The doper my shit, the bigger my come up
Now tell me, have you ever heard a female vocalist
Swift like this that kick shit like this?
I don't think so, I don't think you know
No hoe that can flow like I flow
And plus, if you like it rough and rugged, then you love it
Play it, say it day to day, you never ever get enough of it (Woo)
Ain't I ridiculous? It's dat bad mamma-jamma
Like Hammer, you can't touch this

Ain't no thang, ain't no thang
For me to put it down and make you motherfuckers swang

Di-di-di-dah, di-di-di-dah-di-day
All you suckers anxious, won't you please come out and play?
