No stems, no seeds that you don't need
Acapulco Gold is badass weed
Uh

Somebody call the cops, let 'em know the funk bandit's back
With more bounce to the ounce, it's the Brat-tat-tat-tat
The funk-keeper, competition sweeper known for makin' speakers bleed
Smokin' hella weed, givin' you what you need
Indeed I'm nice, jewelry full of ice
The industry ain't been the same since I came to sprinkle my spice
Tonight's the night and we gon' all get lifted, recognize the gifted
And how there's no fuckin' around in the westside district
Get it twisted if you wanna choose your destiny
Leave all that simple shit at home and bring your fuckin' best to me
'Cause right here playtime stops
Okay, rhymes flop and all that real-deal shit hits tops
See, I'm the cream of the crop, head bitch in charge
And there ain't nothin' or nobody that I've barred thus far
A repertoire full of wicked shit, lay back kickin' shit
All the right shit to give a nigga a hit

If you lets nothing hold you back and your limit is the sky
Put your hands in the air, let's all get high
Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Lay back hypnotized to the funky sound
If you lets nothing hold you back and your limit is the sky
Put your hands in the air, let's all get high
Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Lay back with Da Brat and just get on down
You might also like
Let's roll up a sack of the funk and smoke it together
Now how high can you go?
'Cause you know we can choke
Take it slow, we smoke and choke
'Cause you rollin' with Mo
We having a celebration
We doing this all night if you wanna get away
You can play in 
And never forget that, my nigga, we doing this shit the thuggish way
But have you thugged it with a thug lately?
We crazy, and nigga, we often got the bud blazin'
So if you get high, better get with this vibe
Hey Brat, you wanna get weeded? Fuck with your thugs out of Cleveland
Stay P.O.D.-ed and tweeted, them leaves we blazed and we fiending
Now can you feel this connect with So So Def-Mo Thugs?
My squad and your posse, my nigga, we gon' be alright
So come around, everybody, party down, get down
And let that real shit hit your chest, 'cause I know where to get the hydro
Your nigga thugsta, gimme some love
With some of that bang and slang, your dog, a couple of thangs from the cut
You want me to fly, you want me to fly? We go, whatever, we get on
Get high, get high, we served and killed and got you hypnotized
Get it when you dealin' with me, my nigga, feel me
Get your smoke on, man, 'cause if we go broke, I won't feel bad (Yeah)
But it's enough hundreds for that to never happen in action
Certified Platinum, slashin' bastards
Draw shit faster than Eastwood, you wish you could be like me
I broke the mold with fatality, visual shit that you could see
Leave synthetic niggas, peaced and smoked reefers with my peeps
Get deeper than The Abyss, watch me and your nigga creep
Sky's the limits, dim the lights 'cause Krayzie got the hydro
Inject a deadly venom grinnin' and watch them all die slow
We non-fictional characters, carry grudges 'til it's dealt with
Underestimate the wrong bitch and get your shit split
You better light a spliff and mind your motherfuckin' business
Or get that ass put in the witness protection program 'til I'm finished
Diminish your entourage, ain't my level
Blind 'em with the VVS rocks, possess 'em like the devil
Pushin' custom drop-tops, keep some ganja in the glove box
Puffin' with crooked cops, and can't nothin' hold me back, 'cause nigga, my shit don't stop

You want me to fly, you want me to fly, you want me to fly?
I said, you want me to fly, you want me to fly, you want me to fly?
We can all get high, get high, get high
We can all get high, get high, get high
You want me to fly, you want me to fly, you want me to fly?
I said, you want me to fly, you want me to fly, you want me to fly?
We can all get high, get high, get high
I know we get high, get high, get high
You want me to fly, you want me to fly, you want me to fly?
I said, you want me to fly, you want me to fly, you want me to fly?
We can all get high, get high, get high
We can all get high, get high, get high
You want me to fly, you want me to fly, you want me to fly?
I said, you want me to fly, you want me to fly, you want me to fly?
We can all get high, get high, get high
