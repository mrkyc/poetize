Clap your hands, everybody
And everybody, clap your hands
To the niggas in the back, clap your hands
And to the bitches in the front with the blunts, it's time to dance
So get your ass up out your seats
And get down to the sounds of the B-R-A-T
Now me, I be she with the funk
Puttin' the Holyfield beatin' on the ass in your trunk
Now as the rhythm and the rhyme connect
It's like asthma, motherfuckers gaspin' for breath
'Cause I'm Def So So, very it's scary
Never teary and what I kick is necessary
'Cause bullshit irritates the ear
That's why I'm here in the clear, have no fear
Don't worry, 'cause everything is fine
Just fire me up and watch you lose your mind

Mind blowin'
Doodoo-doo, doo-doo-doodoo
On and on 'til the break of dawn
You see the beat don't stop until the early morn' (Ooh, yeah)
Mind blowin'
Doodoo-doo, doo-doo-doodoo
It's like that and as a matter of fact
When it comes to the Brat-tat-tat-tat, I'll make your neck snap back (Ooh, yeah)
You might also like
My shit is what the niggas like
Gangster as funk is all we write
Well, it ain't got no slang if it ain't got no funk
And your shit ain't shit if your shit don't bump
Did it bump? Nigga, you know what you're bound to get
When you're fuckin' with that shit from a So Def bitch
I kick shit in a pitch only cheese can see
Pack funk like sweeninin' pack tallacy
It's me that Brat, so ease on back
And let me slide on up to the top of the stack (Lye)
From the Westside, Def Side is my crew
Chant a wicked verse and rip your neck off like voodoo
My shit, fly shit, why should I get
Mixed in a shovel with these other bitches? It's just (Word)
Me, myself, my blunts and my clique
Blowin' yo' mind with some gangsta shit (Oh, yeah)

Mind blowin'
Doodoo-doo, doo-doo-doodoo
On and on 'til the break of dawn
You see the beat don't stop until the early morn' (Ooh, yeah)
Mind blowin'
Doodoo-doo, doo-doo-doodoo
It's like that and as a matter of fact
When it comes to the Brat-tat-tat-tat, I'll make your neck snap back (Ooh, yeah)
Come one, come all to this funkdafied gatherin'
To see what you ain't seen or go where you ain't been
It's where I take you with my fantastic tactics
Exciting like gymnastics and harder than mathematics
I obliviate the mind leavin' you in daze
For days, fucked up by the ways
I play shit, complicated but basic
I ain't nothin' to fuck with and you gots to face it
You can't trace it, 'cause ain't no outline you can't out-rhyme
You can't route yours like I route mine
Energetical, funkadelical made for the radio
'Cause stereo wherever I let it though
It's on, on to the break of dawn
Non-stop shit though it's straight to your dome
Don't worry, 'cause everything is fine
I'm fired up and you done lost your mind (*giggles*)

Mind blowin'
Doodoo-doo, doo-doo-doodoo
On and on 'til the break of dawn
You see the beat don't stop until the early morn' (Ooh, yeah)
Mind blowin'
Doodoo-doo, doo-doo-doodoo
It's like that and as a matter of fact
When it comes to the Brat-tat-tat-tat, I'll make your neck snap back (Ooh, yeah)
Mind blowin'
Doodoo-doo, doo-doo-doodoo
Ooh, yeah
Mind blowin'
Doodoo-doo, doo-doo-doodoo
Ooh, yeah

On and on 'til the break of dawn
You see the beat don't stop until the early morn'
It's like that and as a matter of fact
When it comes to the Brat-tat-tat-tat, I'll make your neck snap back
On and on 'til the break of dawn
You see the beat don't stop until the early morn'
It's like that and as a matter of fact
