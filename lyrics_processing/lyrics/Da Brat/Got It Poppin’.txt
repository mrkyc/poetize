Ha, yeah, So So, haha, So So

It's so so many dudes in here
It's so so many tricks in here
Somebody fuckin' one by one
I'm tuckin' numbers under the bra
'Cause my pockets is full of hundreds and them platinum cards
I'm back at the bar buyin' it up
I keep a gang of niggas runnin' 'cause I'm fly as fuck
They linin' up
Over by the cameraman
So they can take a picture of me with a blunt in my hand, strikin' a pose
Tight with the flows
I'm stayin' in the club 'til this muthafucka close
Bitches is fightin', security flashlightin' niggas over they heads
Draggin' 'em out the party, leavin' 'em half-dead, the music bumpin'
Niggas be musty and funky, wanna push up on me
I tell 'em, "I don't ever sleep lonely"
Only got one life to live
So I'ma be here like Erica Kane on All My Children

If, all you gotta say is some ignorant shit

My niggas don't play, I must admit
I pray you never have an altercation with my clique
We make alterations quick, hem niggas up
Dim they lights, send 'em on one-way flights

It's so packed in here, and I'm stuck in the middle
Niggas is touchin' on me, my nipples is gettin' hard
I'm hot and bothered, oh God

Shit, that how it is in the club with them boys
When you try to fit in, you better know what you doin'
Maneuver left to right

Rock to the rhythm of the funky beat
I'm forever your lady, B-to the-R-A-T
