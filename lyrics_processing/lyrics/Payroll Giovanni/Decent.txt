Yeah
Helly
You know
Shit don't change
Helluva made this beat, baby
4-1

When you broke you everybody's friend
Shit gon' change when you get a Benz
The game gon' test you, it's gon' try to stretch you
But if you grind it out, I swear the game will bless you (I swear)
Pointers in the bezel make 'em treat you special
Move my family out the ghetto, I deserve a medal (Yeah)
Who would think that kid runnin' up strapped, moe
Could give his family everything they asked for?
I done been ballin' and back, bro
Move weight, my back broke
In coupes, we crack jokes
"Not bad for black folks"
Is what my neighbors say when they see the foreign skate away
Still got paper plates, fresh as fuck, I do this every day
You should see the shit I don't show, the shit I don't post
Bring your bitch around us for a day, I bet she don't want
Your broke ass with no crib and no cash
No work or no bag, no sense and no class
In the 6, I rolled past, I just cruise, don't go fast
I want you bitches to see me, I know I make it look easy
My reputation proceeds me, lame niggas, they irrelevant
Ain't gotta sell a brick, I'm catchin' every blessing sent (Blessed)
They gon' slander your name and they gon' spread lies
They gon' turn on you right before your very eyes (They is)
They want you to lose your mind and give up on your grind
But stand tall every time, and nigga, never wine (No)
Is you built for it? Shit ain't a joke
It's either lose folks or stay broke
That's the laws of growth (Yeah)
Niggas that burn bridges do a lot of both
From runnin' off cats they should've kept close
Why you think I ain't pressed for press?
A press photo on my phone every time I get dressed
The shit you niggas stress, I don't even sweat
Chillin' at the bar, cool twenty on my neck, thirty in my sweats
Humble but I'm confident
The shit rap owe me, man it's time to get
So many times I said fuck this rhyming shit
Should disappear and move West with some pies to flip (Yeah)
But I'd be cheatin' myself
My loved ones saw some shit I didn't see in myself
Said I got a gift and I could change the world
While I'm thinkin' 'bout money flips from exchanging girl
The fuck I'ma get out of lyin' to fans?
Knowin' when I go to sleep I am not that man
Nigga, I sleep fine, I probably smile in the bed
Knowin' exactly who I am and I stand on what I said, boy
I never been a snake or did no weak shit (Never)
I never broke the code about no street shit (Never)
I never once went against my brothers
Never fucked my niggas' wives, girlfriends, or baby mothers (Never)
Never went against my hood
Never lined my mans up, nigga, get it understood (Get it right)
Never blocked niggas from eatin'
This the shit that keep me peaceful when I'm sleepin'
