"Ooh is that Payroll from Doughboyz Cashout?
Look at him with all ice and that Louis on, shit I know that's him
He gone pay some of these bills
Buy me some bags and shit, with his fine ass
I'm bout to go get on him, I look okay?
I'ma come up off this nigga"

It go one, two, three and to the four
I never gave a fuck about a money grubbin' hoe
She talking 'bout she mad at me, Im like "bitch so
You can pick up that little ass purse and hit the door"
All these hoes old news, rockin' the same old trues
Breaking they neck 'cause I just parked a day old coupe
Hop out, tats compliment the jewelry
4-1 P on the chain, it's yours truely (Bitch)
I heard you like niggas with nice shit
That drive nice whips, with a A1 ice kit (Okay)
I only wanna hit, she said "Damn nigga really?" (Straight up?)
I said why purp', shit I'm blunt like a Philly (Forreal)
I keep these hoes in line, might show 'em a good time
Pat-ron with lime, then I'ma coming behind
Then ima wake up and open up them Westin blinds
Can't help you out, but you're panties Ill help you find (Now get out!)

Sipping Don, my whole fit Louis Vuitton
Im looking like a pot of gold to these leprechauns
She think my dick a magic wand, I must be a wizard
They wish they could get a Cashout Rich Nigga
You can't get in the picture just 'cause I got me some cheese
I'm a dog but I try to stay away from you fleas
When you on the rise bitches get to swarming like flies
You would think they really love you like they wearing a disguise
When I looked into her eyes I seen something unusual
This gold diggin' bitch had dollar signs on her pupils
You got me confused boo, I ain't one of these suckers
Once I get through fucking Ima pass yo ass to my brother
I could never cuff her, she can't even hop in my coupe
Yea she had some good brain but she don't got a clue
That I'm married to my cash boo, it's just us
And since you so money hungry, you can eat my dust (I'm Out)
What? So you just gone leave like that, you ain't shit, fuck you

Bitch don't play rolls with me, you wanna roll from me
Or just call your girl like "Payroll with me"
Try show me off a little, and call me yours
But that will never happen baby, come on you a whore
Ice crowd the band, its no more space
This bitch make the same flash that a photo make
She all texting me like "Damn Pay, you oh so fake"
I said "I ain't ya man baby, so know yo place"
Girl you faker than gusto
You ain't a bad bitch, just a high priced busto
Dick suck everybody, probably got strep throat
These hoes is sad, dirt poor
And lookin' for a walking money bag
I don't fuck with scallywags, at least not no mo'
Once I fuck it's over, I'm done, finito
You heard I'm getting money off of trees and some kilos
Now driving down Fenkell tryna' find me like Nemo
Damn they call this nigga Fenkell Payroll where he at?
He be riding and shit over here

She know I'm paid
And she just wanna get a taste
She see how I live
And she just want a piece of it
She tryna gold dig
But from me she ain't getting shit
But I don't love her, I don't trust her
I just lust her and to me she's just another bitch

Doughboyz Cashout bitch
I scream it cause been it
You thirsty ass hoes out here
All in the club, buy me a drink
Buy me this, buy me that
No bitch, go buy a job!
You broke minimum wage lookin ass gold digging bitch
Don't go broke tryna look rich bitch
Act your wage, we know what the deal is
Instagram ain't fooling nobody
You gold digging ass bitch
