They say good things come to those who wait
I say good things come to those with weight
At least is how it go when you around my way

What you know about talking outta state with plugs
Discussing numbers over 100 dollar plates with thugs
Talking crime over wine, cocaine over champagne
Shook hands in the back of the black range
Kinda remind me of back in the day
When *** had the cartel plug and pounds of yay
I was a worker back then tryna earn my stripes
The big homie said Killa should be taking his life
Now I'm pulling up in Porsches on blocks I used to hustle on
Street nigga fucking with rap, I get my juggle on
Sometimes I get fed up like motherfucker its on
I rather get my smuggle on
One call a couple gone
Park the spaceship right at the hotel
Hop in the low key, make sure I got no tails
Duffle in the trunk, now its time to take it in
Made it through the day, tomorrow we gon' do it all again

Count money at the stash house
Thank god, for the last drought
I dreamed this on my mans couch
Made it happen, now its coupes when we step out
Every time I made a sell, I kept the 9 on me
I hope the alphabet boys ain't got they eyes on me
So I'm moving, talking codes like I'm being watched
Reading motherfuckers lips when I hit the block
New niggas stick out like a sore thumb
Gotta watch for them robbers, when the bag come
Lying to myself like this the last run
But I'm addicted to swooping up back funds
Niggas smiling in my face that's 
Everybody looking at you like the last plug
Tequila sippin' at Flamers, yeah a nigga livin'
But they don't know about the stress that comes with it
Gotta get with it
They say good things come to those who wait
I say good things come to those with weight
At least is how it go when you around my way

I don't really believe niggas have fun bluffing
Niggas will tell you anything and they show you nothing
I'm a coach, I make plays, so my team eat
Came home, now I'm back like I ain't missed a beat
Don't be around hot niggas cause I don't need the heat
Just play it cool with my foundation, silentest move
I wake up and shoot moves, gotta be scoochie on cruise
I wake up and shoot moves, gotta be scoochie on cruise
Then meet my nigga Pay  for lunch
That's that mob shit bitch get you killed over brunch
What y'all make in a year, we make it right in a month
Drop that ticket on your head, have niggas ready to hunt
I'm a hustler, gangster, I'm reppin' the thugs
While you tryna get a buzz, I was stepping on drugs
When you icy hoes tend to flirt
Fo sho you got to worry
My mama said go to church, I went and I splurged, church
They say good things come to those who wait
I say good things come to those with weight
At least is how it go when you around my way
