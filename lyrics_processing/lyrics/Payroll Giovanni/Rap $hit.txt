...when it comes to Detroit, but then you have a lot of guys, like even Doughboyz Cashout. You got them. It's so many, um, different guys from Detroit where they have the potential, but it's like, "Oh, nah, this mothafucka too street for this shit." You know what I'm sayin'?
You know, fuck about this rap shit
Yeah
Been havin' coupes, VIPs, jewelry, mansions
Shit ain't glow up

Two diamond chains on as I'm climbin' out the nickel (Yeah)
Amiri jean saggin', Louis belt hold the pistol (Yeah)
Shittin' on these niggas, wetter, taller than the tissue
Money thicker than the book, our issue just caused an issue (Boy)
I don't need to fuck with niggas just to look official (Nah)
When I left the game, it replied, "I'ma miss you"
I don't know how to net beef or sneak diss you (No)
I'd rather send them killers at you niggas with the missiles
I done sold every drug, paid off every plug (Yeah)
Closed out all tabs, iced the Rollie, all cash
I don't know dude, but his boss, that's my main mans
Don't expect my results, we don't take the same chances
My heart used to drop when I seen the raid van
Had to get organized, then move like a made man (Like a boss)
I was a youngin' rockin' Prezis (Rollies, all that shit)
That's why a lot of shit don't impress me
(I ain't worried 'bout that shit, nigga)

You like this watch? Get a deal, you can get one (Get one)
Double doors, tall ceilings how the crib come
