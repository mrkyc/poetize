Chain on my dresser laying next to the Presi' evidence hustling heavy
Stack the 20's looking messy
Trees screaming (loud)
Blow screaming stretch me
Paper and lead erase niggas if they test me
Fuck a pop quiz I was tryna cop Biggs
Same chains as Wiz they like 'how he copped his?'
Did he got signed, did he get something in advance
I heard he got cash off hand to hand grams
Coupe door slammer, cute whore rammer
Fucked your hoe without giving her my name, where my manners?
Baby I'm Pay, Payroll Giovanni
Boogers in the bezel, Rollie face looking snotty
Wrap 'em up good, gotta hide that scent
Maybe somewhere in the hood, bring every last cent
Tunnel vision with that money, I don't see nothing bitch
Passed out at the suite, too many champagne sips
Woke up and see my

Raw and uncut nigga

Money counter going, money slowed up now it's blowing
Coupes in the summer, long sleeves when it's snowing
Fall up in the club, now we Ace of Spades pouring
No sports but I'm scoring
Watch hit me for a foreign
Been broke was born, I had get to it
The plug tryna test me, I gotta run through it
Money I done blew it but work my bread invested
That's why my necklace, VS1 infested
 wasn't impressive
Versace here, Dolce there
Gucci on my floor, got Louis Vuitton everywhere
The shoes I wear I ain't gotta wait in line for
Cause everybody can't afford them shit, you gotta have dough
I talk shit cause I can
Bail' jeans one band
Rap took me serious this was never in my plans
Just sell a little weight
Move to another state
Buy a couple businesses and lil real estate

Used to cop cut up and promote D
Now I'm doing videos, putting on for the D
Seen this believing but with us you can see
Doughboyz really do this, shit way more than music
I was up hustling you was in the bed snoozing
You tryna keep up and I ain't spent yet, just cruising
Fuck losing, so I made some O's flip
Constipated attitude, I don't take no shit
Think you fucking with me, you got no sense
I'm Nina with these broads, motherfuck that hoe bitch
Freshest nigga in the club but I'm wearing old shit
Hottest nigga in the streets but I always got a cold bitch
With B Smith talking brick numbers
Tryna put down three plays so we can ball six summers
VVS got my wrist numbers
You ain't respected, just a well known dick sucker
