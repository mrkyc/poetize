Rappers under microscope, so we can't slip either
And we move right, they say we gang leaders
Just thinkin' to myself, since I came two-seated
My mens growin' animosity, I quickly seen it
Damn (Damn), that's the gang though
Want sixty on the ice, that's just the chain though
A lot done changed, but I'm the same though
When you got power, it's just certain spots you can't go
Dummies gon' say ''He actin' scared'' (Huh)
Boy, I can get your whole hood buried
But that'll bring the wrong attention and change my focus
And if I ain't focused, then I ain't growin' (Nah)
Niggas think you broke, when you ain't blowin'
Niggas went from bust downs to bills they can't pay for
And crackin' jokes, I'm just bein' real
That pandemic aftermath got the streets ill
But on a lighter note, just sold all the way
Call my girl, told her ''Throw that shit on, let's board the day''
Told her ''Baggin' motherfucker, look, I can't talk today''
Cancel this one bitch, I feel like a boss today
Gettin' rid of what don't flip the vision
Most they hit, a missin', but wit' me the shit consistent
Not gettin' shit, put in my hand, put me in position
We're sellin' quarters now, a nigga get a quarter ticket

I've been postin' less and livin' more, yeah
I've been stackin' shit and chillin' more, and gettin' money
I've been postin' less and livin' more
Stackin' shit and chillin' more, plottin' on Aventadors
Look around your circle, is y'all gettin' rich or gettin' poor? (Which one?)

No more frontin' niggas
Plug press, so I'm rushin' niggas
Told myself after this bag, man, I'm done wit' niggas
Rather be havin' lunch wit' execs
A hunnid cares on my neck, the watch tellin' ''Cut the fuckin' chick''
'Til then I'm doin' what I gotta do
If you providin' for your fam, then I'm proud of you
I used to risk it all for some Prada boots
Rap was on hold, move the fool is what I gotta do
I was a young nigga, tryna get it
Coppin' Ye from cons on the West Buildin' to a chicken
Stay focused, stick to your mission
Most of these niggas jewelry barred and the whip's rented

That's why I've been postin' less and livin' more, yeah
I've been stackin' shit and chillin' more, and gettin' money
I've been postin' less and livin' more
Stackin' shit and chillin' more, plottin' on Aventadors (Yeah)
Look around your circle, is y'all gettin' rich or gettin' poor? (Which one?)
