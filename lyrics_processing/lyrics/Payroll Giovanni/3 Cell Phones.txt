Had a whole thing, but I flew through it
Never left the game alone, cause I'm true to it
Years later, all these shit talkers boo-hooing
Let me introduce myself, I'm who your boo's screwing
I've been going hard for years, get used to it
Money first, bitches later: that makes good sense
Break the work down and stuff it in the GoodSense
I need it all, let's do it if cheese involved
Fucking with weed & raw, it's just in me to be a boss
I cop it, then drop it off. That talking dude, knock it off
Cause I can chill at a loft while your head gets knocked off
I'm speeding through the city streets, pulling up on blocks
Niggas get in my whip and drop off knots
I dap him down, he said he's slappin' now
So he gon' need another pound. Bet, call me, I'm around
(I'm just)

Scrambling through the city for a stack (for a stack)
With 3 cell phones on my lap (on my lap)
Hoes calling, but I gotta hit 'em back (hit 'em back)
Money call him like "Nigga, where you at?" (where you at)
Scrambling through the city for a stack (for a stack)

You might also likeI ain't going home 'til I reach my quota
Took my youngin from a zip to copping a quarter (QP)
I want to see my niggas progress
Your Rolie's ticking, that bitch sending bomb threats
Run the streets all day, stomach on E
Got money waiting on me, fuck if I don't eat
Served my mans at the station in Brightmoor
Then walked in the store and grabbed a bag of Munchos
Hopped in the whip, now I'm on the freeway
Banging Blade on my way to P. Play
A quick 5 got me feeling kinda bossy
Cell phones ringing, that money trying to stalk me
If ain't 'bout business, don't call me
My phone stay busy (which one?) Nigga all three
Detroit niggas grind 'til nightfall
You lame rapping niggas, we ain't like y'all

Scrambling through the city for a stack (for a stack)
With 3 cell phones on my lap (on my lap)
Hoes calling, but I gotta hit 'em back (hit 'em back)

Made a G before 3, made 3 before 5
Around 6, I'm on the 5 in the 5 counting 5
Bands, plotting with my mans on the money plan
Had the youngins on the corner watching for the raid van
Trapping wearing Ray-Bans, cause I'm a cool nigga
Tell a ho she's nothing to me (bitch), cause I'm a rude nigga
Went from the Nike kid to a Louis shoe picker
Used to be down, I guess the money was a mood switcher
I'm ambitious, mixing blow on clean dishes
Came up on you bitches, made these niggas witness
How it's supposed to be done
Fuck who in it, cause we already won
I guess y'all talking for fun
Y'all can't fuck with my son, let alone me
"Get money, stay low key" what OGs been told me
Keep that 2900 dog, I need the whole 3
Shoutout to the real niggas, fuck whoever owe me
(Hah, fuck all you bitch niggas)
