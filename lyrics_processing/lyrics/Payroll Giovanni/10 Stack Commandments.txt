AK, I think it's time to show these niggas how to stack some paper up
4-1

Off top, first: you gotta get money (Get money)
Without that, how the fuck you gon' stack, dummy? (How?)
Find a good hustle then you run wit it (Run wit it)
Let 'em know it's on the flo' and they can come get it (Come get it)
Second: you invest in your hustle (Yup)
The bigger it get, the more that money gon' double (Double up)
For a minute, though, a nigga gotta struggle (Fuck it)
But stay focused, in a minute you gon' bubble (You gon' bubble)
Third: you gotta pay yourself
Not too much, you might gotta play yourself
But this the grind, though (The grind)
I know you in a rush to shine, bro
Gotta be patient, that shit gon' come in due time, though (It's comin')
Fourth: you gotta have willpower
Don't be buying shit, you gotta have chill power (Chill out)
That bring me to number five: stay at home
Shoot your moves, take it in, watch that money get long (Yea)

Number six: Go on a thirty day grind
"For thirty days, I can't spend one dime?"
Yea you can, but only for a few things (Like what?)
Like haircuts, and food, and shit the fam need (Okay)
Number seven: Have more than one income (Got two)
So you can stack up and still live off one (Yup)
It's money out here, don't you wanna get some? (Don't you want it?)
Don't you wanna be loaded wit your wrist numb? (Young nigga)
Number eight: Come to an understanding wit your mate
Now ain't the time for Ruth's Chris plates (It ain't the time, baby)
If she a 'hunnid, she gon' understand
If not, she can get the fuck on, fuck wit another man (Bitch)
Number nine: You gotta pay ya overhead (Yup)
That's your bills; after that, it's back to stackin' bread (Back to stackin')
Let 'em laugh, nigga they the real dummies
