Aight, if you gon' stack some money, first you gotta get some money
Find yo' lane, master that shit, flip that shit, and stack that shit
4-1

Found the money lane then I ran wit it (Ran wit it)
Over time I sat back and watched my cash thicken (Yup)
Motivated by the clothes and the bad bitches
The big jewels and the coupes with the glass tinted (Coupes)
Started selling weed, it was too slow (Too slow)
How the fuck is this gon' put me in a two door? (How?)
I need minks and some kinda foreign shoes on
So I switched to sellin' 'yay and got a few gone (Gone)
Work and baggies fill the table up
If they raid the crib, this shit is federal, just pray for us (Please)
If I gotta question your loyalty, get away from us
'Cause we gon' have to make you an example if you play wit us (Baow!)
The hoes lookin better now (They lookin' better now)
It's obvious I'm on a whole different level now (Different level now)
Used to rock rubber bands, but it's bezels now (What else?)
Audemars and Dweller's now (What else?)
Benzes with the leather now

Get money, get money
I got a stack, can't let it get from me
Get money, get money
But I can't walk around this bitch bummy
Get money, get money
I got a stack, can't let it get from me
Get money, get money
But I can't walk around this bitch bummy (I can't)
You might also like
Got a stack, I can't spend it cause it's comin' (Nah)
Last time I did that, I ended up with nothin' (Nothin')
It's easy gettin caught up in the life, dude, trust me (Trust me)
Spendin' every night, thinkin' everybody love me (They don't love you)
Looked up and it was just me (Just me)
Broke as fuck, down to my last three G's (Damn!)
I looked the game in the eye and said, "Please, (Please!)
I've been loyal to you, help a nigga get back on his feet" (I've been loyal to this shit!)
Then I ran into this older dude, we was cool
He was enthused about me making moves (Ok)
Dude had some weight to move, soft or hard, he told me choose
Fronted me a half bird, now I gotta show and prove (Ooh!)
This next run, I can't fuck it up
Can't fall off, nah I gotta keep comin' up (Comin' up)
I don't know how long it's gon' last
So a nigga gotta treat every run like it's his last

Get money, get money
I got a stack, can't let it get from me
Get money, get money
But I can't walk around this bitch bummy
Get money, get money
I got a stack, can't let it get from me
Get money, get money
But I can't walk around this bitch bummy
Yea man, gettin money a beautiful thing, man
When you come from nothing to gettin' paper, you know you think you done maxed out, like, "Damn I'm gettin' too much money"
Then you start gettin' more money on top of that?
Man, that shit beautiful
Gotta stack that shit, though
You don't know when that run gon' be over wit
