Talkin' on my iPhone with a fur on my back
Two rubberbands tieing up my stack
I'm a Fenkel nigga baby, I came up off packs
Now I live off rap no more shavin' crack
When I see these bitch niggas I ain't givin' a dap
Cause they can't stand a nigga and that's a fact
When you was tryna be a goon, posin' with guns
I was already a boss servin' soap in them slums
Used to dance on water, no ballet shoes
Now valet coupes, behind me is the troops
And they got money too, everybody play they role
Boy your lil' ass Rollie look like something for a hoe
Bitch they call me Payroll who style they stole
Open your mouth about me and eyes gon' close
I'm with Roc, HB, Quis and Dre Dinero
And these is VVS baby, gon' ahead and get you some

Pay talk that shit, you know you be talkin' that shit
They love when you talkin' that shit
These niggas ain't talkin' 'bout shit
They wanna hear hear Pay talk that shit
You know you be talkin' that shit
They love when you talkin' that shit
These niggas ain't talkin' 'bout shit
They wanna hear hear Pay talk that shit

If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead
And I be on the beach drunk, sand all in my head
I'm tryna be a humble dude, a smooth nigga
Cause if I talk money would ya hurt feelings
Young nigga crib laid like a king
Got a queen in my California king
My plug on the trees is a California king
You can get money too just get with the right team
You movin' slow I got a pocket full of fast cash
Cause I fuck around with pounds, like a  hashtag
I ball for the times I was stuck with bad bags
Me and bro was sad so I stuffed grams of glass bags
Bitch you dare 
No logo that's what you call shittin' lowkey
I give her now a year to prolly peep what this is
And look back like "damn he been doin' it big"

Pay talk that shit, you know you be talkin' that shit
They love when you talkin' that shit
These niggas ain't talkin' 'bout shit
They wanna hear hear Pay talk that shit
You know you be talkin' that shit
They love when you talkin' that shit
These niggas ain't talkin' 'bout shit
They wanna hear hear Pay talk that shit
I swear the shit is so lovely
Look around everybody gettin' money
Yeah that's how its 'posed to be
I done broke real bread with every nigga close to me
I wanna see you win, young nigga win
Stack atleast a 100 ball with that first 10
It's some snakes in the grass, you gotta weed them
So treat your killers good, you gon' need 'em
A toothpick in my mouth while I'm sittin' in the Benz
Bitches doubted me I balled on 'em for revenge
Chopper in the closet, got a bale in the den
You gon' pay me what you owe, I ain't gon' tell you again
NIggas muggin', bitches smilin'
Niggas cuffin' like a 

Pay talk that shit, you know you be talkin' that shit
They love when you talkin' that shit
These niggas ain't talkin' 'bout shit
They wanna hear hear Pay talk that shit
You know you be talkin' that shit
They love when you talkin' that shit
These niggas ain't talkin' 'bout shit
