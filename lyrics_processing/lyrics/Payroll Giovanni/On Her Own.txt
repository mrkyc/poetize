Oh, oh
Yeah
Oh-oh-oh
Tell you what I like
She the type to get to the paper
You know
How she got that car
Oh, oh
Gotta, she gotta
That's how you let 'em know

She only fuck with the best, never settle for less
Diamond quality VS, from her wrist to her neck
Lames come around and flex, but she never impressed
What you spent on that chain, she blow on that summer set
And the bags cost a bag, she hurtin' bitches' feelings when she brag
The shit that just not gettin', she done had
That's her lifestyle, she rock the Rollie with the ice dial
Watermark iced out, tellin' niggas to pipe down
Tryna ball on her, she gon' ball on you
Poppin' bottles ain't new, shit, she pop bottles too
She at the crib by two, wake up and handle business
Stack her own digits, ain't dependin' on no niggas
Classy, but nasty, but you'll never know
'Cause she don't carry herself like a ho, and that's for sure
I seen her at the Gucci store, we had the same coat
And mines cost me four stacks, yeah, baby ain't a joke
You might also like
Yeah, yeah, she done bought the pendants on her own
She know how to get it on her own
Yeah, she the type to grind even later
Always gettin' to the paper (Gettin' to the paper)
That's how she got that car own her own
How she got that crib on her own
Gotta get to the paper, gotta stunt on these haters
Yeah, that's how you let 'em know

She got her own crib out in the burbs where the lawyers live
Gated community, no loiterin', that's order shit
Walk-in closet, but she mainly in the office
Watchin' her business, makin' sure it ain't fallin'
Independent ballin', 'bout to open up a shop
The same way I used to get a crop and open up the block
But her money all legal, she don't be in the street
She don't know who got killed and what crews got beef
She ain't out every night all caught in the hype
When she out, it's hella rare, she gon' make 'em stare twice
Goddamn, she my type, that's the shit a nigga like
That make me wanna spoil her and keep her neck bright
I swear a boss ass bitch is my kryptonite
Against the rules, but you can pull up to my crib tonight
And when I met her at the door, she rocked the long Louis coat
With some 1942, goddamn, I love you
Yeah, yeah, she done bought the pendants on her own
She know how to get it on her own
Yeah, she the type to grind even later
Always gettin' to the paper (Gettin' to the paper)
That's how she got that car own her own (She got that car)
How she got that crib on her own
Gotta get to the paper, gotta stunt on these haters
Yeah, that's how you let 'em know

Oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh
She the type to get to the paper
How she got that car
Oh, oh
Gotta, she gotta
