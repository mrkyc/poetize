Its still fuck what a nigga say, and how a hoe feel
Was livin' like I had a deal with no deal
Used to cop pills and flip that shit
If RJ was still here he'd tell me get that shit
Workers got me on some sit back shit
With a bitch that's thick
That break me off on some kit kat shit
Presi on match the bottle when I sip that Cris
Say you been ballin', guess we all missed that shit
Cause I ain't hearing niggas cloudy ass diamonds, I stay clear
Niggas phony ass fraudulent cash can't come near
Nigga can't hold no man hand, but I can steer nigga
Crib out in no mans land I let  hit you
I used to sleep in the basement at Grannies
Choppin crack just to hit the club fresher than a mannie
Grandaddy used to give a little lecture to Mannie
A little work I was just happy buying food for the family
Years later I was rocking big Jewels in a caddy
Scooping cheese for my mans, telling cool "get at me"
Still make the bag move even though they would tax me
I'm a motherfuckin' Fenkfell fool look at me
41 on this chain this one say FA
Out in LA, fuckin with Eses
I sold wet yay, going to dry though
Youu can't fuck with me at least you tried though
Cuz need a front, well pull up on my side hoe
Don't to the front, meet around by the side door
 Got money with little 
Copped from T spoon when he had the Benz
Free my niggas B smith he had them in
Niggas ate good everytime I had a package in (Facts)
Been through a bunch of bullshit, but still I crack a grin
If I don't rap, it's back to selling crack again (yuh)
Been a ill nigga since Hilfiger
Never respected money, I respect the real nigga
Copped four O's, I felt like I real dealer
Cartiers on I was a bitch nigga bitch hitta
Stacked my first 10, then saw ninety more
I shit on any nigga, Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Niggas like pay "you so laid back, you hella smooth
If anybody got the right to talk shit nigga its you" (okay)
I remember when you was a kid on the block
Saw you pulling up real big on the block (big on the block)
Looking like I'm trying to buy a crib when I shop
Hoes flocking cause I pulled up with Kidd in the drop
Heroin Supplier, future Lambo buyer
Fuck with me, you gon' think I got Rambo higher
My youngest wild, got the whole Ave on fire
I'm just trying to get cash til it can't stack no higher
I could show you some gymnastics
But it involve some plastic, a dealer and a goon
So much scrilla in the room I don't even trust the walls
I was raised in Detriot where you can't even trust your dawg
Asked about the haters I'ma tell you fuck em all
Ask about the paper gonna tell you tuck it all
