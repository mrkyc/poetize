I'm from a hood where everybody 'bout it
When I was broke I had to do something 'bout it
Dropping off work in many different houses
Granny cussed me out when she found a bunch of ounces
Like 'Boy don't get this crib raided, you remind me of yo pops, early '90s  late '80s'
I'm like 'Granny I'm just trying be all I can be'
I'm copping quarter birds trying to make it to a key
Hustling faithfully, trying to make my bread peal
But still feel like I'm running on a treadmill
Chasing after thousands, I'm trying to tread mills
When kingpin dreamin', just know the Feds real ( Uh )
Man luxury is so far from my position
Now I'm second guessing
'Is my life in the right direction?'
My sack in my pocket
Got my rocket for protection
Lord I need a plug or a blessing, please help me

I'm living in the basement, petty dealing
Had to hide my crack good 'cause my uncle always stealing
Walk through the door, moms and granny on the couch
Like 'Boy you got to get a job and take a other route'
Arguing and yelling at me, I just take it
They don't understand my own path, I got to make it
They don't understand I ain't motive to live basic
I tried a job out but I just couldn't take it
I'm dealing with enough stress, getting my hustle on
Plus I got to get judged when I go home
Plus my right hand growing up, dead and gone
His killer dead too, but the pain lasted long
In my attempts to come up, got fucked up
Buying bad crack, fucked my last bucks up
But long as you're still breathing, you can make a change
I ain't never give up, even when I had the

Who would ever think that same kid running down the street
Would grow up to push coupes on chrome feet
And my crib can go on Cribs
Champagne in the fridge, Gucci shit for my kid
Money counter on my kitchen island
Fly shit got the bitches eyeing
Can't fuck with me but these niggas trying
I could walk you play for play through a boss course
Grew up in the ghetto, now my crib by a golf course
Sun shining through my window in the morning
 taking business calls, while you snoring
A trip my family out to see what I became
For my life to change, I had to change my brain
Had to think outside of the box
I used to watch for the mailman, parked outside waiting on my box
Now this rap shit tie my day up
Imagine where I be, if I wouldn't quit and gave up
