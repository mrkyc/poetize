Like I used to tell you and RJ
Get your first ten, that's a get a twenty get you fifty
That fifty get you one hundred
And its time to fall back and stay our the way
Don't worry about the nigga you see
Worry about the nigga you don't see
Cause thats the nigga getting the money

It seems like just the other day I got my first 10
Fuckin around with weed heroin and yay
Got me my first 10 my first (my first ten)
I said momma I'm a man now, I done made my first ten
I'm on the road to gettin' big cash now
I done made my first ten my first ten

Trappin out cribs with no doors on the hinges
Only way we know how to get four benzes
Trust fucked up so I'm riding solo in it
Any money scheme count me in you know I'm with it (lets get it)
I started small thing dope game cocaine
Every young nigga dream was to come up on a whole thang
So we slang like there's no tomorrow
Was taught to go get my own, fuck beggin and borrow (fuck that)
I used to cop eight balls and double up
Stackin every buck but rap sluts fucked up
I was doing a lot, but wasn't doing enough
Cause where the fuck is my is my rims on the long sleeve truck
Copped the BI, looked up now I'm the guy (the man)
Grinded for my first chain so I hold my piece high (shining)
It felt like I got my first win
Couldn't tell me shit when I got me first ten
