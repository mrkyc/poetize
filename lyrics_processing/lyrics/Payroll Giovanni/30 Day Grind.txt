I'm takin all cells, collectin' large mail
Now hoes see the V by the twelve when I bail (Errrt!)
Started off wit nicks, then I built it up to bales
On the road to riches I done took a lot of L's (Yup)
Bounced back after every one of 'em
That last batch, I'm done wit 'em
You gotta come wit' some, my niggas pumpin' em (Come on)
Pockets lumpin' up, bitches jumpin' up
When they see us 'cause they see the ice behind tint in the Europeans (Yup)
But it started wit hard work and dedication
Steady savin, no misbehavin' when money makin' (Nah)
We used to hustle for Forces and leather Pelle's
Now we livin' like them niggas on Belly, my nigga's heavy (Boy)
Boulders in the Presi', in a Rover on my celly ("Hello?")
My enemies bitches, we bent 'em over in the telly (Yea)
Got them on the flo', let me know when you ready
On the grind, so it's nothin' too big or too petty

Blowin' up my phone, I'm really thinkin', "The audacity!"
He steady askin' me was I finished with what he passed to me
