This is how we move it, we got that white
And a real low price, we got it here on the Westside
If I ain't making drop-offs then I'm pickin' up
Riding through the hood in a long-sleeve truck
Heard my spot, just got raided
But the work all gone and the money we done made it
We got that good in my hood, get right
All the hoes on my nuts cause they know I'm that guy
I been runnin' with the killers gettin' money with the wise guys
Get the bag and get our groove on
This how we all get paid
So stack up your bucks and throw your Rollie up
And let me hear the hustlers say

I got a plug and it's all because
This is how we move it
Detroit niggas do it like nobody does
This is how we move it
We pay the neighbors, we got much paper
This is how we move it
Let's flip the sack, bring the old grooves back
This is how we move it

Stay down, live straight get cash
Move pounds, flip weight, gym bags
Two-step on the dog, wrist dance
Stack money up and ball on they bitch ass
When my man's call, I love to see his number
Cause he cop at least 10 nigga, never nothing under
I'm deep in the game, praying it don't take me under
Had to be a work pumper, shit I never had a jumper
Couldn't find an occupation so I formed an operation
Hard work I got to shapin'
Money came I got to save it
Froze chain and matchin' bracelet, yeah a nigga kitted up
Rumours, I don't give a fuck
I'm out here tryna get a buck
Marble floors, stainless fridge might as well live it up
Cop a coupe and tint it up
I bought a crib then ran it up
But I put a bag in the house and flew through it
Bitch, this is how we move it

I got a plug and it's all because
This is how we move it
Detroit niggas do it like nobody does
This is how we move it

This is how we move it
Let's flip the sack, bring the old grooves back
This is how we move it
What

Never sold crack but sold hella bud
Met a plug back when I was broke, got me sellin' drugs
Sellin' crud, got me sippin' Cris' 100's in the tub
Flood the neck then find the next city, I'ma flood
Nigga what? I'm sellin' all bundles, get a dub
Before I stash it, get the vaseline and give it rubs
Get a slug if you plot, I worked too hard to give it up
Diamond cuts in the piece, safe to say I'm cuttin' up

I'm a supplier, you a fucking liar
I rock all white Buffs, you got on fucking wires
That nigga Kidd prolly copped ice, then Hutch retired
Only time you touched a bag when you worked at Meijers
Nigga you a dicksucker, how many cliques you hopped
I can get the bag gone, from wrist to rocks
That fifth will pop if you try to breach nigga
I been sellin' dope for years, I can teach niggas
(you hear me)
I got a plug and it's all because
This is how we move it
Detroit niggas do it like nobody does
This is how we move it
We pay the neighbors, we got much paper
This is how we move it
Let's flip the sack, bring the old grooves back
