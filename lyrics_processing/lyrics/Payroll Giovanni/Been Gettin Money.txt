I'm a Detroit nigga so I talk like one
And you can tell I'm a dealer 'cause I walk like one
My left wrist all frost up, numb, I done bossed up dumb
A couple L's, I had to chalk up some
Now my jeans full of large lump sums, amount unknown
Niggas say they bosses, but ain't putting one soul on
When my chains done I go and cash it, I don't pro-long, You be telling jewelers I ain't ready, damn, hold on
Dealers don't post drug money on the net
You can make up a image, can't make up respect
Got the 'Vette the same week that I paid the connect
You was raised by a G if you don't hate on the next
Ain't tryna impress no bitch and meet none of you niggas
Go over there 'cause we don't fuck with you niggas
I'm from a whole different breed, man, what's up with you niggas?
Ass kiss anybody just to touch a few figures
I can't relate to that, everybody rap but, who stating facts?
Went from weed to crack in just don my graduation cap
The 40 I'mma stay with that, you know I'mma blast
I don't want your bitch, she want me, but I be hoeing her ass
Got your stash in my pocket, even more in my stash
Used to ride the bus, now a nigga fly first class
I was wearing maskeen when I got my first bag
In the spot with RJ, skipping my first class
Crack cocaine made me my first grand (I'm a G)
I was buying ice before rap fans, you understand
Fuck a vouch, my whole fam watch me get it with caine
Ask your main about them days I used to get it with Maine, nigga
You might also like
I'm off the bench with it, my turn like Big Quis
Ask them streets they'll tell you how I was knee deep
Fuck with BYLUG, we motivate to go harder
Back in '08 I used to traffick in the same year Charger
Never thought I'd be in front eye of the media
That's why I used to fuck with them grams before Insta
Bitch, you want me to kiss her, but that's breaking her code
We was broke together so these aces never gon' fold
And stuck by the G-code ever since I been a juvenile
We started getting money, boy, I been pulling out piles
Been putting on piles of  at the same time
Been selling dope, been throwing gang signs
Call my jeweler, tell them double my karats
Even took some subways to get the work off like Jared
Need help, I'm in a panic neck got water damage
Somebody call the medics, can't you see I'm drowning damn it
Whole industry glad I ain't dropped yet
I don't tuck shit, all my chains out, bitch
Shot aller, I get a nigga dropped quick
Think I'm playing Imma leave a nigga momma sick

If it's problems I call the drama clique, I be on that Obama shit
Moving presidential, jumping in and out of all kind of whips
Brain full of game, I got a 40 full of hollow tips
When hoes see you eating they gon' bug you tryna swallow it
It's nothing to get a flood zips on the set
Same night I'm in the bar taking sips of the best
If you run up with the work, I'm sending his where you rest
You can't come around here, you better dip to Tibet
They be "like what this young nigga on?" (what he on?)
Cause I got a chinchilla on
And keep getting calls on three different phones
I don't give a fuck about fame or having rapper friends
I'm just really after ends, real hustlers back again
Bitch boss up
Broke nigga, please boss up
Bitch boss up
Broke nigga, please boss up
Bitch boss up
Broke nigga, please boss up
Bitch boss up
