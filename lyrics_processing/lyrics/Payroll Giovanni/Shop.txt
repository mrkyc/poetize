Wholesale I don't split em up
I used to sell rocks to get a buck
Couldn't settle there I had to get it up
I got 4 drugs in one house
3 straps on one couch
Did it myself, but I fed way more than one mouth
These niggas and these bitches I really don't give a fuck 'bout
This a place of business you ain't spending get the fuck out
Lowkey with it you too obvious nigga
Balling like the lotto, putting raw in lottery tickets
First you find yo own lane then you run with it
Set up shop and tell em come get it

Shop shop shop shop hit my line
Everytime I pick up my phone I'mma get it gone
Get money get power get clout nigga
Get M's, make ends, get out nigga
Take losses, bounce back, don't pout nigga
Stay away from small minded big mouthed niggas
Dudes swearing the got pills in the boy
Til they catch a case and try to pin the shit on their boys
Get a bag then strip get employed
Now we getting toys
Bitches jock, niggas get annoyed chumpin get destroyed
Use to get to work and have my people workin
They started fucking up so now I ain't  a people person
Thats the main reason why a lotta people hurtin
Is you purpin or you workin it's for certain
Hit me up and come
