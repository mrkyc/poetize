Why the fuck he ain't answering his phone is he fucking stupid
I gotta see what he doin', so if my nigga don't answer I'm pullin up
Smackin' blunts, lean bottles
And all those lean cups and blunts
A bitch over there suckin' his dick and you don't even know
Don't fuck with that fuck ass nigga anymore
If its a bitch there if that same bitch there
I feel sorry for that bitch

Real niggas is rare so when they see me they gon stare
Walking in my Yeezys easy these are $1000 for a pair
Now I'm rockin' solitaire, you see her man rockin' chips
She was stuck on the lame til she got real nigga dick
I got a bitch that compliments the whip when she in the passenger
She only deal with dealers, daily niggas can't handle her
If she trip I vanish her, if she thick I'm baggin her
Fuck her in the Benz but I'm rammin her, rammin' her
I was in a 'vette with of rookie on my set with cookies, louis swet's and hoodies, i'm a boss  never press for pussy
Don't expect me to, what I look like sweating you
You say your man drive a what?
Baby girl my neck a coupe

I had them hoes like
Why can't I ball with you?
Hit the mall with you?
Spend it all with you

Girls see me, like I found him (mhm)
Girl this watch is sixty thousand (hee got moneey)
Go pitch yo' self you ain't dreaming,you seeing what you seeing
Im every thing im seemen, gucci on the courts the lates session
She wanna give me coogi for no reason, she say i make her nervous and fuck up her breathing, stacks pokin out my balmains
Rumour has it he was dabbling in the raw game
