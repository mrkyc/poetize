I came up off the yay, I came up off the grind
I came up off pills, I came up off pounds
When the drought came around you know I broke shit down
When I took them losses you was no where to be found
Niggas got they hand out like I owe me
But talk shit when you tell 'em no like you did nothing for 'em
Guess you got amnesia, I done tried to feed ya
But you fucked that up, you don't remember that either?
Nigga I done bought bad crack
That let my cash flat
You prolly bought a bad O, I done bought a bad batch
I just kept making moves and I let the cash stack

I ain't taking pics with money 'til I'm all the way legal

Came up off work

You know that I came up off work

You know that it's fasho

Wearing they man's watch, borrowing niggas chains
You all in your bars talking 'bout some cocaine
But you all in the bars looking fucked up and lame
Givenchy T cover up the pistol
While I'm on my way to cop some shit you ain't hip to
You dudes ass kiss street niggas to look official
Yeah, my name Sizzle cause I sold blow like a whistle
They say when I'm wearing all my jewels that I'm cheating
Cause it  sheetin'
Might see me at a classy spot, where jews having meeting
And it ain't no secret, they can tell by my greeting that I

Came up off work
You know I came up off that work
You know that I came up off work
