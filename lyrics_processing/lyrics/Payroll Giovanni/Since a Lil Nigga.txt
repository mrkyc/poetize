4-1
We gettin' dough now and we don't give a fuck who know now
One hundred thousand whip behind me when I pose now
Paid for the chain in full before the mold now
Damn that's how ya'll boys do it? (Come on now)
Used to have a operation in the basement
That consist of shaving shit harder than the pavement (crack)
That explained his bracelet, that explained his watch
That explained the money in the Nike shoe box
Before YouTube I hid rocks in my tube socks
Bitch it's DBC for life, I don't crew hop (never)
I done balled 5 summers off a two pots (I did)
Rocking a gold Presidential like 2 Pac
All eyes on my Bentley
I let them killers go if I ever feel offended
Conversation short I never been long winded
But my money long, since a kid I been gettin' it

I been gettin' money since a lil nigga
I been gettin' money since a lil nigga
I been gettin' money since a lil nigga
Hanging with them motherfucking drug dealers
My turn, I been gettin' money since a lil nigga (yeah)
I been gettin' money since a lil nigga (Yeah)
I been gettin' money since a lil nigga
Hanging with them motherfucking drug dealers

Big Quis, call me crispy, I'll smack yo ass
I earned the name from all the years that I was getting cash
I deserve to brag, all the shit I done did
Never had a G-Shock, I had a Breitling as a kid
Fuck this rap, let me get into my resume
Had a 745, Range, and a Escalade
Got a coupe and I bought two diamond crosses yesterday
Now I'm icy as than a motherfucker standing next to Pay
Had a foreign car before I ever wrote a bar
Had Rollies his and hers before I ever wrote a verse
Pulled down your bitch thong before I ever made a song
All the money I done blew got me right where I belong
Had a  trailblazer with the rims to match
50 thousand in my mattress, I didn't know how to act
If you been gettin' money where the fuck you was at?
Cause everybody in the city of Detroit knew that

I been gettin' money since a lil nigga

Hanging with them motherfucking drug dealers

I used to play the block with my sack on me
Walkin' down the street with hella crack on me
Wasn't old enough to buy liquor
But I could buy the fucking bar nigga
All these lames cliquing up
I'm just cash picking up, get a bag split it up
Yeah my niggas live it up, offsets sittin' up, Rolex glistened up
If you need some boss coaching lil' nigga listen up
Where the fuck y'all was at when I was riding sixes?
Willy front 60 bows I ran through them bitches (I had to)
Bought a chain, a watch and a mink bomber
Then I went and gave my momma fifteen thousand dollars
I'm the motherfuckin' man, can't say I'm not
I beat that case, the next day I bought a Rollie watch
We got a deal now and honestly it's well deserved
We been on the scene, I don't know where them niggas were

I been gettin' money since a lil nigga

Hanging with them motherfucking drug dealers
My turn, I been gettin' money since a lil nigga (yeah)
