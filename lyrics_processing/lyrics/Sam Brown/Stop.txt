All that I have is all that you've given me
Did you never worry that I'd come to depend on you?
I gave you all the love I had in me
Now I find you lied and I can't believe it's true

Wrapped in her arms, I see you across the street (I see you across the street)
And I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on
Oh, you talk of love, but you don't know how it feels
When you realise that you're not the only one

Oh, you'd better stop (Stop)
Before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop (Stop)
Before you go and break my heart
Ooh, you'd better stop

Time after time, I've tried to walk away (I've tried to walk away)
But it's not that easy when your soul is torn in two
So I just resign myself to it every day (Oh, every day)
Now all I can do is to leave it up to you

Oh, you'd better stop (Stop)
Before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop (Stop)
Before you go and break my heart
Ooh, you'd better stop
You might also like
If you love me (You will remember)
Now's the time to be sorry (That day forever)
I won't believe that
You'd walk out on me
Baby, yeah, yeah
Ooh


Oh, you'd better stop (Stop)
Before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop (Stop)
Before you go and break my heart

Ooh, you'd better stop
(You'd better) Baby, stop
(You'd better)
Oh, you'd better stop
(You'd better) Oh, stop
(You'd better) Baby, stop, baby, stop
(You'd better)
(You'd better)
You'd better stop, stop, stop
(You'd better) Stop
(You'd better) Yeah
(You'd better) Stop
(You'd better) Ooh
(You'd better)
You'd better stop
(You'd better)
(You'd better) Oh
(You'd better) Yeah
(You'd better) Ooh
(You'd better) Ooh
(You'd better) Ooh
(You'd better)
