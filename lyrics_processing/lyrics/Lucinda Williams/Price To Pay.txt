It weighs a lot, it costs a lot
But it's worth a whole lot more
But it's not something you could afford anyway
'Cause you weren't careful with my love
You lost the key to the door of my heart
Now there's a price you have to pay

You can shop around and look around
But you'll never find
Another one quite like this one any place
And believe me, it won't be easy
To repair it this time
'Cause it's my heart
And there's a price you have to pay

It's my heart and there's a price you have to pay
Enough is enough
You played too rough with my heart
Now there's a price you have to pay

Well, it's broken and there's nothin'
That I can do now
I can fix it but it won't ever be the same
I can pick up all the pieces
And start over somehow
But it's my heart
And there's a price you have to pay

It's my heart and there's a price you have to pay
Enough is enough
You played too rough with my heart
Now there's a price you have to pay
Enough is enough
You played too rough with my heart
