Pulled up the roots that his Daddy laid down
Country boy thought he'd try the city life
Tired of workin' the dirt, watchin' the sky
I won fifty bucks off of Bobby's little sister
She said he'd last a month, I said it'd be quicker
Bobby said, it wasn't what he thought it was
He had to come back to the place he loves
'Cause there ain't much of nothin' out here
Just a bunch of fence and pasture
Grain elevators and a couple old tractors
Little bitty church, big ole steeple
Ain't no noise, no red lights
Ain't no buildings messin' up my moonlight
Ain't no doubt, why I live out
Where there's more cows than people
I saw on the news where the interstate
Might be movin' out this way
To make this a better place to live
Well hell, I like it just like it is
'Cause there ain't much of nothin' out here
Just a bunch of fence and pastures
Grain elevators and a couple old tractors
Little bitty church, big ole steeple
Ain't no noise, no red lights
Ain't no buildings messin' up my moonlight
Ain't no doubt, why I live out where there's more cows than people
