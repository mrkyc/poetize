Every time you go, I'm in the shadows
Every day you know the pain inside grows
Without you I lose the way
Fall apart, go insane
Used to be I'd hide inside the TV
Lately that's not really working for me
No one with anything to say
Not to me, not to me

On and on and on
The days drone
I need a song

What to do, tell me what I gotta do
I can't sustain in the way I'm missing you
So I turn the radio up, looking for a melody
But nobody's singin' to me
It's a blur, don't remember what I heard
You said goodbye, now I don't know where to turn
So I turn the radio up
Thinking I'm gon' find relief
But, baby, nobody's singin' to me
You might also like
Every night, I'm just a victim of the silence
Nothing there to help, I tell you, love is violence
Hurts more and more with each day
If you're asking me, the price is paid
Used to be that I could call on my DJ
Tell him what it is that he could play, play, play
Play those words, I wanna sing along
Make me feel (Make me feel) nothing is wrong

What to do, tell me what I gotta do
I can't sustain in the way I'm missing you
So I turn the radio up, looking for a melody
But nobody's singin' to me
It's a blur, don't remember what I heard
You said goodbye, now I don't know where to turn
So I turn the radio up
Thinking I'm gon' find relief
But, baby, nobody's singin'

One word to take away this hurt
Waiting for one dream
To bring you back to me
Oh
What to do, tell me what I gotta do
I can't sustain in the way I'm missing you
So I turn the radio up, looking for a melody
But nobody's singin' to me
It's a blur, don't remember what I heard (Whoa)
You said goodbye, now I don't know where to turn
So I turn the iPod up
Thinking I'm gon' find relief
But, baby, nobody's singin'
What to do, tell me what I gotta do
I can't sustain now in the way I'm missing you
So I turn the radio up, thinking I'm gon' find relief
But nobody's singin' to me

Mm, oh yeah
