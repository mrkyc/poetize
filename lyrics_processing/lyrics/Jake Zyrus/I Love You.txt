I opened my mouth, it all rushed out spoken
Though I never meant you to know it
I lost all of myself and got held in the moment
Without even knowing

I stopped and got lost in my mind
I've never felt so unraveled in my whole life

I said, "I love you, I love you, I love you"
But now I regret it
I said, "I love you, I love you, I love you"
But I'm sorry I said it
But what's done is done, I can't undo what's done
Don't wanna hurt this thing we've just begun
I know I've said it, but can we forget this?

I caught myself and I'm scared that we're broken
Though you never could see it coming
And I don't know what, why or how our hearts are hoping
My feelings are showing

I stopped and got lost in your eyes
I never thought you could make me so alive
You might also like
I said, "I love you, I love you, I love you"
But now I regret it
I said, "I love you, I love you, I love you"
But I'm sorry I said it
But what's done is done, I can't undo what's done
Don't wanna hurt this thing we've just begun
I know I've said it, but can we forget this?

Now I'm hoping your heart's open
Words unfolded, now you know
And I couldn't hold it all inside
Push it back into rewind
Now my secret's spoken

I said, "I love you, I love you, I love you"
But now I regret it
I said, "I love you, I love you, I love you"
But I'm sorry I said it
But what's done is done, I can't undo what's done
Don't wanna hurt this thing we've just begun
I know I've said it, but can we forget this? (Oh, whoa)
I said, "I love you, I love you, I love you"
But now I regret it (Now I regret it)
I said, "I love you, I love you, I love you"
But I'm sorry I said it (Oh, I'm sorry i said it)
But what's done is done, I can't undo what's done (Undone)
Don't wanna hurt this thing we've just begun (Just begun)
I know I've said it, but can we forget this? (Oh, whoa, can we forget this?)
"I love you"
And now I regret it (And now I regret it)
"I love you"
I'm sorry I said it
"I love you"
And now I regret it
"I love you"
