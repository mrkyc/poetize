Oh, whoa, oh
Oh, whoa

We were driving along
But it felt like I was alone
'Cause you and I weren't right
You can cut the air with a knife
We had to pull off the road
'Cause it felt like something was wrong
So we put a traffic sign in the middle of nowhere
Day fight and night

I breathe in, I breathe out
Gotta get a grip
We're done, no doubt
Was it worth the trip? (Was it worth?)
Breathe in, breathe out
I'm trying
Ain't gonna let you suffocate me
No matter how long it takes
I gotta breathe you out, out (Hey), out (Oh)
Out, out, out
You might also like
So we finally got home
A long day, I was tired from the road
It's gonna be a long night
As I toss and turn to hold you tight (Mm)
You've got me driven all wrong
Even though that it's time to move on
Took a while to realize that we're going nowhere
Fight after fight

I breathe in, I breathe out
Gotta get a grip (Hey)
We're done, no doubt
Was it worth the trip?
I breathe in, breathe out
I'm trying
Ain't gonna let you suffocate me
No matter how long it takes
I gotta breathe you out

Running and changing, Holding and waiting
For love to come back when it's already fading
How we wasted too many risks in this relationship (In this relationship)
Lookin' for ways to get over the pain
Remember to breathe again and again (Whoa, oh)
Gonna be strong, breathe in
I breathe in, I breathe out
Gotta get a grip (Hey)
We're done, no doubt
Was it worth the trip?
I breathe in (Oh), breathe out
I'm trying
Ain't gonna let you suffocate me
No matter how long it takes
I gotta breathe you out
Breathe in, I breathe out, oh
Gotta get a grip
We're done, no doubt
Was it worth the trip? (Was it worth the trip?)
I breathe in, breathe out
I'm trying
Ain't gonna let you suffocate me
No matter how long it takes (Oh no)
I gotta breathe you out, out, out (Ooh)
