Ooh, yeah
Whoa

My pulse is getting fast
My heart is gonna crash
Hey, I got something to say to you
We've been on overdrive
Maybe we should take some time apart
I'm always on the road
I'm putting on a show
I know you really try to keep up with me
Baby, we're compatible
But you must be sick of all the bull I pull on you

Now I'm having second thoughts about us
I think I like it like it was
I know I shut the system down
But now I wanna bring it back up

We need a reset
Don't wanna regret not making up with you
You and I are fading from the screen
Can we prevent a freeze?
We're losing power, and we're spinning down
Suddenly back up, dedicated now
We crashed, but we can turn it around (Round and round)
After a reset (Start it up again)
Yeah, oh (Start it up)
Oh, woah
You might also like
I'm tired of the nights
Without you by my side
We only seem to text and e-mail
So you come on the road
Maybe we don't have to fall apart
It's working for awhile
But I see through your smile
This isn't the life you signed up for
You tell me it'll be okay
As you board a different plane
Back to where you were

Now, are you having second thoughts about us? (Oh)
I know that I'm still in love
I know you shut the system down
But don't you wanna bring it back up?

We need a reset
Don't wanna regret not making up with you
You and I are fading from the screen
Can we prevent a freeze?
We're losing power, and we're spinning down
Suddenly back up, dedicated now
We crashed, but we can turn it around (Round and round)
After a reset
Hey, hey
Pakinggan mo naman ako
Hey, hey
I think this is the way
Na dapat gawin
Reset
Sna naman ika'y sang-ayon din
To all the things I'm gonna say
I wish
Ika'y pumayag din
Mag-aagree ka ba?
If I tell you that
Magsimula tayo para
Tayo'y sobrang happy na
We should reset all this
Ibalik ang nakaraan
Start it up, start it up, oh, baby
Start it up again, oh
Start it up, start it up

We need a reset
Don't wanna regret not making up with you
You and I are fading from the screen
Can we prevent a freeze? (Can we prevent a freeze?)
We're losing power, and we're spinning down
Suddenly back up, dedicated now
We crashed (We crashed), but we can turn it around
We need a reset
Don't wanna regret not making up with you (Making up with you)
You and I are fading from the screen (Fading from the screen)
Can we prevent a freeze?
We're losing power, and we're spinning down (We're losing power, we're losing power)
Suddenly back up, dedicated now
We crashed, but we can turn it around (Round and round)
After a reset
Start it up again
Start it up, start it up, ooh
