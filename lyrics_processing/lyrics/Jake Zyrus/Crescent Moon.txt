Oh, whoa, ooh

We always were together
Walking the same road
You and me like destiny
But then the path had parted
You went down one road
And I went the other way
Loneliness, the feeling in my heart is all I have to hold today
Lookin' at the sky that's almost just about to cry
I have to say
I can't help but think of you, oh, oh

I'm here beneath the night
And you're not there
No, I won't cry
Won't cry anymore
Trying hard to live a life without you
Too peaceful
When I think about you, oh, oh
Maybe you're seeing the same big sky
A crescent moon
Fades into the night
'Cause it might be bringing us together
You know I love you more than ever, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
You might also like
The days are getting colder (Colder)
Keeping my hands warm by myself, reality (Oh)
I miss your arms so badly (So badly)
Want you here with me
Want you here with me (Oh, oh, mm)
Even though you call me
And tell me how much you love me
I get blue (I get blue)
You know I wanna hear it, but I really don't like to lean on you
So I'll wipe the tears away, oh, oh

I'm here beneath the night
And you're not there (Oh)
No, I won't cry (I won't cry)
Won't cry anymore (Won't cry anymore)
Trying hard to live a life without you (Without you)
Too peaceful when I think about you

I wonder when I would see you again
Until that time again, I guess I'll have to live
Feeling the power you gave me
When you hold me close
And said I'll always love you, you know, oh
Here beneath the night
And you're not there
No, I won't cry
Can't cry anymore
Trying hard to live a life without you
Too peaceful
When I think about you, ooh, oh
Maybe you're seeing the same big sky (Oh, oh)
A crescent moon (Ah, ah, ah, oh)
Fades into the night (Ah, ah)
'Cause it might be bringing us together (Bringing us together)
You know I love you more than ever (I love you more than ever)
Holding up my hands
Can you feel the pain? (Can you feel the pain?)
I'm reaching out to you (Oh, oh)
Crescent moon (Crescent moon, oh, oh)
