Da-da, da
Da-da, da (Ooh)
Da-da, da
Da-da, da (Oh)

How can I be sure
When everything is so confusing?
I'm old enough to learn
That I'm too young to know what I'm doing
Gotta break free from what used to be
It no longer makes sense for me (For me, oh, oh, mm)

How do I stand out
In a world that's all about fitting in?
I'm certain of my doubts
But I wouldn't be me for no reason

My identity
Right in front of me
There's nobody else I wanna be like (Oh, oh)

Oh, 'cause I'm just trying to find
Find my fingerprint
Redefine
Who am I? Where do I begin?
All I know is what I've been told
But the one I see in the mirror is so different (So different)
Unique as my fingerprint

Da-da, da (Oh)
Da-da, da
Da-da, da (Oh)

I'm positive
That I don't know where I'm going
How do I make sense (How do I make sense)
Of all these crazy emotions?
I'm up and down, get turned around
But I'm still clear on my intentions (Oh, oh)

Oh, 'cause I'm just trying to find
Find my fingerprint
Redefine (Oh)
Who am I? Where do I begin?
All I know is what I've been told
But the one I see in the mirror is so different (So different)
So different
Unique as my fingerprint

Do they see me like I see me?
Oh, not even close
Do they know me like I know me?
Well, I don't know
I'm still undecided
But I realize that it's okay (It's okay, oh)
Good things are worth the wait
Da-da, da
Da-da, da (Oh)
Da-da, da
Da-da, da (Oh)

Oh, I'm just trying to find
Find my fingerprint
Redefine
Who am I? Where do I begin?
All I know is what I've been told
But the one I see in the mirror is so different (So different)
Unique as my fingerprint
I'm just trying to find
Find my fingerprint
Redefine
Who am I? Where do I begin?
All I know is what I've been told
But the one I see in the mirror is so different (So different)
