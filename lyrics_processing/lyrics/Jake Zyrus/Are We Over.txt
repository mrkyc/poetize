Ooh, oh
Oh, oh

Been hearing the whispers
They talking like we're over
Baby, that's news to me
Don't like what I'm hearing
And I don't wanna listen
But are you through with me?
They say that there's been someone else
Who's been taking up your time
They say that there's someone else who's been on your mind
Won't you tell me what is real? Are they right?
Are you gonna let me go?
Let me know
Let me know

Is there any truth to what they talking 'bout?
Have I become the one that you have learned to live without?
Are we over?
Is there any love for me left in your heart?
Have you become the one that's gonna rip my worlds apart?
Are we over?
You might also like
If you're hiding something
I think that you should come clean
Tell me what's going on
Now, am I just tripping
Or is there something I'm missing?
Tell me, is something wrong?
Cause all I hear
Is all the talk that you've got somebody new (Somebody new)
Maybe I'm blind 'cause I don't wanna believe it's true
Won't you tell me what's the deal?
Are we right or are we coming to an end?
Don't pretend
Don't pretend

Is there any truth to what they talking 'bout?
Have I become the one that you have learned to live without?
Are we over?
Is there any love for me left in your heart?
Have you become the one that's gonna rip my worlds apart?
Are we over?

If you're gonna let me go (Let me go)
Don't let me be the last to know
Have you found someone else? (Someone else)
Won't you tell me now? (Oh)
Is there any truth to what they talking 'bout?
Have I become the one that you have learned to live without?
Are we over? (Oh)
Is there any truth to what they talking 'bout?
Have I become the one that you have learned to live without? (Oh, oh)
Are we over? (Are we over?)
Is there any love for me left in your heart? (Whoa)
Have you become the one that's gonna rip my worlds apart? (Tell me)
Are we over?
