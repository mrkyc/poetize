When the tears you fill your eyes
And you can't surpass the shadows
To the sun on the other side
Don't despair because there always will be someone there
Don't lose faith
Love will let you lose your way
Because you, you'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by, I'll get you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong when you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine, you'll never stand alone
Love will stand by
If there's a day, when the rain should find your heart
And your cold and tired and lonely
And this world has you in the tie
Don't be scared
You can just reach for me and I'll be there
Don't lose hope, love will deeper you know because
You, You'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong when you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine, you'll never stand alone
Love will stand you by
Standing by to let you up
All the heavy pain, oohh yeahhhh
