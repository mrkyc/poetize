Every useless one that I ever let fall
Don't tell me you care
All that you're good for now is, "See I told you so"
Till the very last lie you drew me in
And I guess that's why you never knew
That breaking my heart was stupid to do, stupid of you
And you just lost the best thing
That crashed into your life
And if you're done pretending
Then get yourself a life
'Cause payback, here I go
I'm taking back the perks that you'll never know
And you just lost the best thing
That crashed into your life
I take back my heart
Every reckless beat it ever skipped for you
Good for a laugh
Guess for a moment there it kept you well amused
Till the very last lie you drew me in
And I guess that's why you never knew
That breaking my heart was stupid to do, stupid of you
And you just lost the best thing
That crashed into your life
And if you're done pretending
Then get yourself a life
'Cause payback, here I go
I'm taking back the perks that you'll never know
And you just lost the best thing
That crashed into your life
Count your mistakes
'Cause boy, this one's a big one
Can't get it back 'cause the moment's long gone
Look for me, look for me, look for me
Oh, do you even know what you've done?
You just lost the best thing
That crashed into your life, yeah
And you just lost the best thing
That crashed into your life
And if you're done pretending
Then get yourself a life
'Cause payback, here I go
I'm taking back the perks that you'll never know
And you just lost the best thing
That crashed into your life
And you just lost the best thing
That crashed into your life
And if you're done pretending
Then get yourself a life
'Cause payback, here I go
I'm taking back the perks that you'll never know
And you just lost the best thing
