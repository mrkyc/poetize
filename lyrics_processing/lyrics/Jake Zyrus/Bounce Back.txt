No excuses, you don't need to explain
No apologies, I'm over all the pain
I pulled myself up again, out of the flames, made it through
I'm officially over you

Thought I was the one, who's gonna crumble and fall
Thought I was done, but there ain't nothing at all
I can overcome
No, no

I bounce back
Won't be the first time that I've been knocked off my feet
Won't be the last time that I'd find that inner strength in me
So if you thought that I won't break down and cry
Baby, you don't even know me
I bounce back

Don't think I'm broken or losing any sleep
Cause I'm not missing what I don't really need, no
Make no mistake you're to blame, feels good to say I'm brand new
And officially over you

You thought I was the one, who's gonna crumble and fall
You thought that I was done, but there ain't nothing at all
I can overcome

I bounce back
Won't be the first time that I've been knocked off my feet
Won't be the last time that I'd find that inner strength in me
So if you thought that I won't break down and cry
Baby, you don't even know me
I bounce back

I'll be stronger than I ever was before
Even better now
I already closed the door
Was caught in the eye of the storm, 'til I made my way home
Bet you never thought that I would bounce back, oh
I bounce back, oh
I'm stronger than I ever was
You can't hold me down because...

I bounce back
Won't be the first time that I've been knocked off my feet
Won't be the last time that I'd find that inner strength in me
So if you thought that I, won't break down and cry
Baby, you don't even know me, oh
I bounce back
Won't be the first time that I've been knocked off my feet
Won't be the last time that I'd find that inner strength in me
So if you thought that I, won't break down and cry
Then you don't even know me
I bounce back, oh
Bounce back, bounce back
Bounce back, bounce back
