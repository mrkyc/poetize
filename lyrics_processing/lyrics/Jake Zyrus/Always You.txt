I've been to so many moments in my life
Where I can't find anyone to turn to but you
Only you, always you
And when all that's around me are falling
You will remain there standing just for me
Always you, only you

In my weakest times, you were so strong (You were so strong)
When all hope is gone, you carry on (You carry on)
I draw my strength from you
When I could no longer find any of it in me

You are my life, you are my strength
I can't fight the battle alone
I can make it through when I'm with you
'Cause you are my shield, you are my soul
You're breathing life into my heart
All good love that I have comes from you
Always you

I've been lost in the middle of nowhere
And I can't find my way home
I'm so lost without you
But you have pulled me through
You might also like
You took me in your arms
And you rescued me from the dark
And now I'm finally home
I feel safe 'cause now I'm with you

'Cause you are my life, you are my strength
I can't fight the battle alone
I can make it through when I'm with you
'Cause you are my shield, you are my soul
You're breathing life into my heart
All good love that I have comes from you
All good love that I have comes from you
You are my life, you are my strength
I can't fight the battle alone
I can make it through when I'm with you
'Cause you are my shield, you are my soul
You're breathing life into my heart
All good love that I have comes from you

Always you, always you
Always you, only from you
All the love that I have comes from you
