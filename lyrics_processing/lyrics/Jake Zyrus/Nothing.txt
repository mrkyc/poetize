Ooh yeah, ooh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I thought I'd shiver
I thought I'd weaken
When you asked me to meet up again
I was so sure that in one second (Second)
All my emotions would rush back in (Right back in)

You cut so deep
I couldn't see myself
Movin' on without you

I never thought I'd break free
I always thought you'd be part of me
And nothing could change that
I didn't dare to believe
That I'd recover you leaving me
And you couldn't change that
Over
I thought I would cry
Us bein' over
But I'm more than alright
I never thought seeing you again
Would make me feel
Nothing, nothing, nothing
It feels so good to feel
Nothing, nothing, nothing
You might also like
Did you imagine I'd be on fire
To feel you touch me and say my name? (Ooh, say my name)
To hear you saying (Oh) you want to start over (Oh)
I admit I thought I'd feel the same (I'd feel the same)

I hate to break it
To you now
I've moved on without you

I never thought I'd break free
I always thought you'd be part of me (Part of me)
And nothing could change that
I didn't dare to believe
That I'd recover you leaving me (Oh)
And you couldn't change that
Over
I thought I would cry
Us bein' over
I'm more than alright (I'm alright)
I never thought seeing you again
Would make me feel
Nothing (Nothing), nothing (Nothing), nothing (Oh)
It feels so good to feel
Nothing (Nothing), nothing (Nothing), nothing
How can nothing feel so good?
How can nothing feel so right?
How can something be so completely gone
That was my whole life? Oh

I feel nothing at all (No)
I feel nothing at all (No)
I feel nothing at all (No)
I've moved on without you
I feel nothing (Oh)

I never thought I'd break free
I always thought you'd be part of me (Oh)
And nothing could change that (Nothing could change that)
I didn't dare to believe
That I'd recover you leaving me
And you couldn't change that (Over you, baby)
Over
I thought I would cry (I thought I would cry)
Us bein' over
But I'm more than alright
I never thought seeing you again
Would make me feel
Nothing (Nothing), nothing (Nothing), nothing
It feels so good to feel
Nothing (Nothing), nothing (Nothing), nothing
Nothing (Nothing), nothing (Nothing), nothing
It feels so good to feel
