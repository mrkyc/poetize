Mm-mm
Mm-mm

Minutes turn to hours hours turn to days
Knew what I had to do, couldn't find the words to say
We had the perfect story, stories have an end
Had to turn the page 'cause to keep you was a sin, oh

You know that I loved you with (Everything that I had)
But what you needed I (Couldn't be, held you back)
I cared enough about you
To give you the chance
To find someone who can

I broke your heart (I did it for you)
Tore us apart (I did it for you)
Just walked away (I did it for you), oh
For you
You wanted more than my everything (Did it for you)
Someone you knew that I couldn't be (Did it for you)
I doubt you'd ever understand me
But it's true, it's true
I did it for you
For you
You might also like
I could say I'm sorry, wouldn't mean a thing
Tell you what you wanna hear
Baby, what you wanted wasn't for me
Held you by a string
Had to cut you loose
'Cause forever something we can't be

You know that I loved you with (Everything that I had)
But what you needed I (Couldn't be, held you back)
I cared enough about you
To give you the chance
To find someone who can

I broke your heart (Yeah, yeah, I did it for you)
Tore us apart (I did it for you)
Just walked away (I did it for you), oh
For you
You wanted more than my everything (Did it for you)
Someone you knew that I couldn't be (Did it for you)
I doubt you'd ever understand me
But it's true, it's true
I did it for you
They say the ones that you love
Are the ones you hurt the most
For all the pain that I've caused you
Baby, I'm sorry

I did it for you (I did it for you), oh
Tore us apart (I'm so sorry, babe, I did it for you)
Just walked away (I did it for you, ooh)
For you
You wanted more than my everything (Did it for you, everything)
Someone you knew that I couldn't be (Did it for you)
I doubt you'd ever understand me
But it's true, it's true
I did it for you
