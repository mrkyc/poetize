Shawty's love is like a pyramid (Oh)
We stand together 'till the very end (Yeah, oh)
There'll never be another love for sure (Oh)
Iyaz and Charice, let we go

Stones, heavy like the love you've shown (Shown)
Solid as the ground we've known (Known)
And I just wanna carry on
We took it from the bottom up
And even in a desert storm (Yeah)
Sturdy as a rock, we hold
Wishing every moment froze
Now I just wanna let you know

Earthquakes can't shake us
Cyclones can't break us
Hurricanes can't take away our love

Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock
It feels just like it's heaven's touch
Together at the top (At the top, baby)
Like a pyramid (At the top, girl)
And even when the wind is blowing
We'll never fall, just keep on going
Forever we will stay
Like a pyramid

Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, hey (Oh)
Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, hey (Oh)
Like a pyramid, like a pyramid, hey, hey, hey (Oh)

Cold (Cold), never ever when you're close (Close)
We will never let it fold (Fold)
A story that was never told
Something like a mystery
And every step we took we've grown
Look how fast the time has flown
A journey to a place unknown
We're going down in history

Earthquakes can't shake us (No, no)
Cyclones can't break us (No, no) (Oh-oh-oh)
Hurricanes can't take away our love (Away our love)

Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock (Hey)
It feels just like it's heaven's touch
Together at the top (At the top, baby)
Like a pyramid (At the top, girl)
And even when the wind is blowing (The wind is blowing)
We'll never fall, just keep it going (Keep it going)
Forever we will stay (Yeah, woah-woah)
Like a pyramid
Like a pyramid, girl, I'ma show you
That I love you so much, that we gonna get through (Oh-oh)
Even when it storms, I will never go
I'ma be the one to keep you safe (Hey)
Four walls and love, packing more than enough
Holding on to one another, be the cover when it's rough (Oh-oh)
Mother nature (Hey) or disaster
Won't stop our happy ever after, after

Pyramid, keep it going
(Like a pyramid, like a pyramid)
Woah, ooh-woah, woah, woah, woah
(Like a pyramid, like a pyramid)

Pyramid, we built this on a solid rock (Solid rock)
It feels just like it's heaven's touch (Woah, woah)
Together at the top (At the top, baby)
Like a pyramid (At the top, girl)
And even when the wind is blowing
We'll never fall, just keep on going (Keep it going)
Forever we will stay (Charice)
Like a pyramid
We built this on a solid rock (Pyramid)
It feels just like it's heaven's touch
Together at the top (At the top, baby)
Like a pyramid (At the top, girl) (Pyramid, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And even when the wind is blowing
We'll never fall, just keep it going
Forever we will stay (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
