They said when you find love
You'd better hold on
You gotta keep it close to you
But you gotta give love
If you gonna get love
And you will know when love's found you

So I just wanna thank you
For all you have done

Gave me strength when I had none at all
Gave me hope when I was running low
Showed me how to make it through
And for everything, I wanna thank you
You believed when I'd no reason to
You were there when I needed you, oh
And I just wanna thank you
I just wanna thank you

I could imagine a world without you
Facing the hard times all alone
It'd be a cold world (A cold world)
I'd be a lost girl (A lost girl)
If I didn't have you close to home
You might also like
So I just wanna thank you
For all you gave up

Gave me strength when I had none at all
Gave me hope when I was running low
Showed me how to make it through
And for everything, I wanna thank you
You believed when I had given up
Carried me when I was lifted up
I just wanna thank you
I just wanna thank you, oh

Oh, I'll be stranded, I'd be nowhere
Million miles away from all I know, oh
But you were there to keep me grounded
I counted on you, you brought me home, oh
You gave me strength

Gave me strength when I had none at all
Gave me hope when I was running low
Showed me how to make it through, oh
And for everything, you know I thank you
You believed when I'd no reason to (Ooh)
You were there when I needed you, oh
And I'm still standing here (Oh)
I just wanna thank you (Whoa, oh, whoa, oh)
I just wanna thank you (Thank you, thank you, thank you)
I just wanna thank you (Just wanna thank you)
I just wanna thank you (Oh)
