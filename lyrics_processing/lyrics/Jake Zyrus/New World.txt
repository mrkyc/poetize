Staring the stars, feeling the winds every time
I cannot stop thinking of you, since you've been gone away from here
Shedding the tears, crying out loud for once
'Cause you are such a precious part of me
And there's no one who'll fill my broken heart

Oh, but now, I have realized
The reason why I live in this world
Even you have left me here alone
I found the way where I can get hope for the future

Baby, I'm gonna see the new world
With nothing but the love you gave me
Only thing I can do, is to trust the time we shared
Baby, I'm gonna go to the new world
With nothing but the strength you gave me
There's nothing to be afraid of
I know your love will lead me where I should be
Even if it is dark and hard time for me
I don't wanna give up my hope

Having a dream, basking in the sun everyday
I'm starting to thank that I'm still here
Though the pain of loss still hurts me
Making me smile, making me laugh many times
Everything is gentle to me, because you are making it so
You might also like
Then now I have realized the reason why I live in this world
It's not to lose what I truly need
I will make, sure to build the beautiful days together

Baby, I'm gonna see the new world
With nothing but the love you gave me
Only thing I can do, is to trust the time we shared
Baby, I'm gonna go to the new world
With nothing but the strength you gave me
There's nothing to be afraid of
I know your love will lead me where I should be
Even if it is dark and hard time for me
I don't wanna give up my hope


Pray for all the things in this world
And believe in the power of our love
Sing a song of tomorrow
Now we are not alone
And we come to life again
A new day will come to you, for you and me
Baby, I'm gonna see the new world
With nothing but the love you gave me
Only thing I can do, is to trust the time we shared
Baby, I'm gonna go to the new world
With nothing but the strength you gave me
There's nothing to be afraid of
I know your love will lead me where we should be
Even if it is dark and hard time for us
