Mmmm~~~~
(You know that I love you)
(Charice)
Minutes turn to hours
Hours turn to days
Knew what I had to do
Couldn't find the words to say
We had the perfect story, stories have an end
Had to turn the page cause
To keep you was a sin oh
You know that I loved you with (everything that I had)
But what you needed I (couldn't be, held you back)
I cared enough about you
To give you the chance
To find someone who can
I broke your heart (I did it for you)
Tore us apart (I did it for you)
Just walked away (I did it for you)
Oh for you~~~
You wanted more than my everything (did it for you)
Someone you knew that I couldn't be (did it for you)
I know you don't ever understand me
But it's true, it's true
I did it for you
For you~~
(Drew)
I could say I'm sorry
Wouldn't mean a thing
Tell you what you want to hear
Baby what you wanted wasn't for me
Held you by a string
Had you cut a loose
Cause forever something we can't be
You know I loved you with (everything that I had)
But what you needed I (couldn't be, held you back)
I cared enough about you
To give you the chance
To find someone who can~~
You broke your heart (You did it for me)
Tore us apart (You did it for me)
Just walked away (You did it for me)
Yeah It's true yeah yeah
You wanted more than my everything (did it for me)
Someone you knew that I couldn't be (did it for me)
I know you tried to make this easy
And I see, yeah I see
You did it for me~
(Charice)
They say the ones that you love (yeah, you love - Drew)
Are the ones you hurt the most
For all the pain that I've caused you
Baby I'm sorry~
I did it for you~~~~~~
(I did it for you)
Tore us apart (I'm so sorry babe) (I did it for you)
Just walked away (I did it for you)
Ooh for you~~~
You wanted more than my everything (my/everything)Drew/Charice (did it for you)
Someone you knew that I couldn't be (did it for you)
Drew - (Someone you couldn't be)
I know you don't ever understand me
But it's true, it's true
I did it for you
