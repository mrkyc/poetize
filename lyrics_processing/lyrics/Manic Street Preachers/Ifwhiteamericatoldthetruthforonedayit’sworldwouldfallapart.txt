Images of perfection, suntan and napalm
Grenada, Haiti, Poland, Nicaragua
Who shall we choose for our morality
I'm thinking right now of Hollywood tragedy
Big Mac, smack, Phoenix, R., please smile y'all
Cuba, Mexico can't cauterise our discipline
Your idols speak so much of the abyss
Yet your morals only run as deep as the surface
Cool, groovy, morning, fine
Tipper Gore was a friend of mine
I love a free country
The stars and stripes and an apple for mommy

(Conservatives say) "There ain't no black in the Union Jack"
(Democrats say) "There ain't enough white in the Stars and Stripes"

Compton, Harlem, a pimp fucked a priest
The white man has just found a new moral saviour
Vital stats, how white was their skin
Unimportant, just another inner-city drive-by thing
Morning, fine, serve your first coffee of the day
Real privilege, it will take your problems away
Number one, the best, no excuse from me
I am here to serve the Moral Majority

Cool, groovy, morning, fine
Tipper Gore was a friend of mine
I love a free country
The stars and stripes and an apple for mommy

Zapruder the first to masturbate
The world's first taste of crucified grace
(And we say) there's not enough black in the Union Jack
(And we say) there's too much white in the Stars and Stripes


Fuck the Brady bill!
Fuck the Brady bill!
