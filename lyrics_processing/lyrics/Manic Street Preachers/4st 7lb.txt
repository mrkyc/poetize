"I eat too much to die
And not enough to stay alive
I'm sitting in the middle waiting."
Days since I last pissed
Cheeks sunken and despaired
So gorgeous, sunk to six stone
Lose my only remaining home
See my third rib appear
A week later, all my flesh disappears
Stretch it taut, cling-film on bone
I'm getting better

Karen says I've reached my target weight
Kate and Emma and Kristen know it's fake
Problem is, diet's not a big enough word
I wanna be so skinny that I rot from view

I, I, I, I, I
Wanna walk in the snow
And not leave a footprint
I, I, I, I, I
Wanna walk in the snow
And not soil its purity

Stomach collapsed at five
Lift up my skirt, my sex is gone
Naked and lovely at five stone two
May I bud and never flower
My vision's getting blurred
But I can see my ribs and I feel fine
My hands are trembling stalks
And I can feel my breasts are sinking

Mother tries to choke me with roast beef
And sits savouring her sole Ryvita
"That's the way you're built," my father said
But I can change, my cocoon shedding

I, I, I, I, I
Wanna walk in the snow
And not leave a footprint
I, I, I, I, I
Wanna walk in the snow
And not soil its purity

All things I like looking at
Too weak to fuss, too weak to die
Choice is skeletal in everybody's life
I choose my choice, I starve to frenzy
Hunger soon passes and sickness soon tries
Legs bend, stockinged, I am Twiggy
And I don't mind the horror that surrounds me
Self-worth scatters, self-esteem's a bore
I long since moved to a higher plateau
This discipline's so rare, so please applaud
Just look at the fat scum who pamper me so
Yeah, four stone seven: an epilogue of youth
Such beautiful dignity in self-abuse
I've finally come to understand life
