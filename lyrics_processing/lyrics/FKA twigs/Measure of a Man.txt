Nobody
Feels the pain behind the love you show
Nobody
Feels the burden that is yours alone

If when the morning comes, you're not with me (Destiny)
I know that you'll return with destiny

Only you can truly understand
The measure of a hero is the measure of a man
(I wanna kiss it better, the measure of a man)
The measure of a man
(I wanna kiss it better, the measure of a man)

Your body
Bears the scars of every man I know
So softly
I wanna kiss it better, the scarlet letter
To me, it don't belong

If when the morning comes, you're not with me (Destiny)
I know that you'll return with destiny
You might also like
Only you can truly understand
The measure of a hero is the measure of a man
(I wanna kiss it better, the measure of a man)
The measure of a man
(I wanna kiss it better, the measure of a man)

It's the manners that make a man
But the hammers that break a man
Damn, they wanted to see me broke
But I flipped the script and I broke the bank
Young and wealthy
Don't let it overwhelm me, I still give thanks
Still can't tell me
Not when the system fail me, I still bounce back
I run this ting, got a lot of endurance
What do you know about drastic measures?
I married a hustle, me and the game like Harry and Meghan
Some man in my hood too jealous
Why do you think that we carry a weapon?
Take time and trust the process, life's a game of chess, not checkers
Stop bawlin', you gotta stop stressin'
You gotta stop thinkin' you won't get through it
It's all in your mind
I've fell down a couple of times, I got up and go back to it
Only (Only), you can (You can), truly (Truly), understand
The measure (Measure), of a (Of a), hero is the measure of a man
The measure of a man

Only you can truly understand
The measure of a hero is the measure of a man
The measure of a man
