You know how you don't like shit in the road, they just need to be
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

My heart dissolves away to the rhythm of you
I'll wait till you arrive
You bring your soul to mine, I'm indebted to you
I'll read the signs
You say you can't decide, but I'm just trying
To put it where you want
You got to make your mind up somehow
Take me now

You can be careless
You can be careless
You can be careless with me
You can be careless
You can be careless
You can be careless
You can be careless with me
You can be careless

Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

Fumble here or fumble there (Fumble, fumble)
Infatuated, I don't care (Infatuated)
Long as I can lay down next to you
Run my fingers through your hair
(Scream it all out)
It's the pain that gets me there
Got a safe word, it's okay
You do me then I'll do you
Yeah, that's right, it's only fair (Yeah)
I'll follow my fearless leader (Leader)
Be my guide, yeah, be my teacher (Teacher)
Don't know where you're goin'? Well, I don't either (Either)
That could be your problem
I could help you solve 'em (Solve them, solve them)
Is that of any interest to you? (Oh, oh)

You can be careless (Yes)
You can be careless
You can be careless with me
You can be careless
You can be careless (Please)
You can be careless
You can be careless with me (Ah)
You can be careless
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
(I wanna scream it all out to you)
(Do you hear me when you're gone?)
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
(Yeah, you can be careless, ah)
You can be careless with me, with me
