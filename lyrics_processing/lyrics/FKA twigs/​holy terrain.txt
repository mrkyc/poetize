Yeah, pull up
Let me do my dance
Send this bitch, gon' get case closed
Made a hunnid bands off a brick
Made a hunnid bands off a brick per day, yo
Send my girl to church with some drug money
Told the paper thots they can sell for me

Day one, take me to my favourite show
Day two, hold my hand and pull me close
Next to me, kiss my cheek, 'cause it's early days
Day three, take me to a deep river
Steal a kiss when I'm lost in the mist

Will you still be there for me, once I'm yours to obtain?
Once my fruits are for taking and you flow through my veins?
Do you still think I'm beautiful, when my tears fall like rain?
My love is so bountiful for a man who is true to me

For a man who can follow his heart
Not get bound by his boys and his chains
For a man who can follow his heart
And stand up in my holy terrain (I die, I die, I die, I die for you)
You might also like
I'm blue when the moon hits my skin right
Hot pink when you open up my sweet thighs
Pull you in, and your life can begin, 'cause it's early days

But will you still be there for me, now I'm yours to obtain?
Now my fruits are for taking and your fingers are stained
Do you still think I'm beautiful, when you light me in flames?
My love is so bountiful

For a man who can follow his heart (I cry, I cry)
Not get bound by his boys and his chains (I die, I die, I die for you)
For a man who can follow his heart (I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry)
And stand up in my holy terrain (I die, I die, I die, I die for you)

Throw loads of gold on you just to fall asleep, yeah
I hope you never take my love, yeah, in vain, yeah
For the thunder, through the window I see rain ( I see rain)
Water the garden, play with snakes in Balmain (Oh yeah)
Makin' you front a ball, watch me drown in my pain (My pain)
I feed you poison, forever my lady (Oh baby)
Throw loads of gold on you just to fall asleep, yeah (Fall asleep)
Pray for my sins, make me stronger where I'm weak, yeah (Pray for)
We die, we die together, the prophecy complete, yeah (Prophecy)
We get high, we touch the sky until we deceased, yeah (Deceased)
And if you pray for me, I know you play for keeps, yeah (Play for keeps)
Calling my name, calling my name (Calling my name)
Taking the feeling of Promethazine away (Take it)
For a man who can follow his heart (I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry)
Not get bound by his boys and his chains (I die, I die, I die for you)
For a man who can follow his heart (I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry)
And stand up in my holy terrain (I die, I die, I die, I die for you)
