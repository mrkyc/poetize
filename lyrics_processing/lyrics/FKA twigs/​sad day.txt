Every time you look outside your window
Everything is just the same as before
You are turning 'round and 'round
You see, it's a sad day for sure

Taste the fruit of me
Make love to all you see

Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?
Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?
Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?
Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?

Take a chance on all the things you can't see
Make a wish on all that lives within thee
If you're foolishly in love with me
It's a fine day for sure

Taste the fruit of me
Make love to all you see
You might also like
Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?
Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?
Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?
Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?

You're running
And I tried to make it work before
You're running
I made you sad before
I, then I
Have you ever made a wish before?
I see you running
I made you sad before

I can imagine a world when my arms are embraced around you
I lie naked and pure with intentions to cleanse you and take you
The city howls with a cry to seduce you and claim you
So it's time
And it's a sad day for sure

Would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?
Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?
Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?
Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?
You're running
And I try
I made you sad before
And you're running
