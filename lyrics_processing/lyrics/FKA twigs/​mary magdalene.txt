A woman's work
A woman's prerogative
A woman's time to embrace
She must put herself first
A woman's touch
A sacred geometry
I know where you start, where you end
How to please, how to curse

Yes, I heard you needed me (Breathe on me)
Yes, I'm here to open you (You're so close)
Yes, I know that your heart is blue (Your blood runs deep)
(So cold, so cold)

I'm fever for the fire
True as Mary Magdalene
Creature of desire
Come just a little bit closer to me
Step just a little bit closer to me
I can lift you higher
I do it like Mary Magdalene
I'm what you desire
Come just a little bit closer till we collide
You might also like
A woman's hands
So dark and provocative
A nurturing breath that could stroke you
Divine confidence
A woman's war
Unoccupied history
True nature won't search to destroy
If it doesn't make sense

Yes, I heard you needed me (Breathe on me)
Yes, I'm here to open you (You're so close)
Yes, I know that your heart is blue (Your blood runs deep)
(So cold, so cold)

I'm fever for the fire
True as Mary Magdalene
Creature of desire
Come just a little bit closer to me
Step just a little bit closer to me
I can lift you higher
I do it like Mary Magdalene
I'm what you desire
Come just a little bit closer till we collide
Oh, you didn't hear me now
Oh, you didn't hear me when I told you
Oh, you didn't hear me now

Mary Magdalene
Creature of desire
Come just a little bit
Just a little bit
Mary Magdalene
Creature of desire
Come just a little bit closer till we collide

Oh, you didn't hear me now
Oh, you didn't hear me when I told you
