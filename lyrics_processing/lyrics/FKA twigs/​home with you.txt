I'm so wired, fought it, seen it, tried it
I die for you on my terms
When I get my lessons learned
Apples, cherries, pain
Breathe in, breathe out, pain
No, no, Novocaine
Still maintain my grace

How come the more you have, the more that people want from you?
The more you burn away, the more the people earn from you
The more you pull away, the more that they depend on you
I've never seen a hero like me in a sci-fi
So I wonder if your needs are even meant for me
I wonder if you think that I could never raise you up
I wonder if you think that I could never help you fly
Never seen a hero like me in a sci-fi
But I'd save a life if I thought it belonged to you
Mary Magdalene would never let her loved ones down

I didn't know that you were lonely
If you'd have just told me, I'd be home with you
I didn't know that you were lonely
If you'd have just told me, I'd be running down the hills to you
You might also like
When I visualize, all I see is black (Onyx)
Ground me to the floor, just a little more (Get it, onyx)
I know I've been gone, you've been all alone
Stoking up the fire for you
Set the place alight, call me late at night
And I'll be running home to you

I didn't know that you were lonely
If you'd have just told me, I'd be home with you
I didn't know that you were lonely
If you'd have just told me, I'd be running down the hills to be with you
If you had told me, I'd be running down the hills to be with you
I'd be running down the hills to be with you
