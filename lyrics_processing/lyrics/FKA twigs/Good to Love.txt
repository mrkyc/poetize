I'll pray for you if you give me time
I've had a thousand hearts, now you're after mine

It's not your fault that I'm loved to my limit
I've had plenty so I know you're mine
If only a prayer would make your touch so I'd feel it
But I'd be wasting time

It's good to love
It's good to love, it's good to love
I've got a right to give
It's good to love, it's good to love
But when you give yourself away
It always hurts too much
So you pray to get it back
Only God can give you that
Make my body come alive
I've got a right to hurt inside
So will you hold me while I cry?
And let me lay against your side
So let me love
It's good to love, it's good to love
Just let me love
It's good to love, it's good to love
You might also like
My skin's aching sore from friction past
Touch me softly, make our kisses last

It's not your fault that I'm loved to my limit
I've had plenty so I know you're mine
If only a prayer would make your touch, so I'd feel it
But I'd be wasting time

It's good to love
It's good to love, it's good to love
I've got a right to give
It's good to love, it's good to love
But when you give yourself away
It always hurts too much
So you pray to get it back
Only God can give you that
Make my body come alive
I've got a right to hurt inside
So will you hold me while I cry?
And let me lay against your side
So let me love
It's good to love, it's good to love
Just let me love
It's good to love, it's good to love

It's good to love
It's good to love, it's good to love
I've got a right to give
It's good to love, it's good to love
But when you give yourself away
It always hurts too much
So I pray to get it back
Only God can give you that
Make my body come alive
I've got a right to hurt inside
So will you hold me while I cry?
And let me lay against your side
So let me love
It's good to love, it's good to love
So let me love
It's good to love, it's good to love
Just let me love
Just let me love, just let me love
It's good to love
