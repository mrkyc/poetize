A poisoned apple and a line in the sand
Save the serpent, kill the messenger instead
Now the darkness has an open door
A silver bullet and a hole in the floor
And I swallowed down the sorrow as a last resort
My baby has dirty hands
A saint's heart and a sinner's weary eyes
She don't worry though, she knows she's gonna be all right
It's written on your face, it's a bad news holiday
Yo're gonna break my back 'til I take your place
Tell my mother I'll walk the line straight to my grave
Bloodshot eyes see a man across the sea
Says he wants a holy war and he's coming for me
Yeah he's coming for me
He wants to bury me down where I won't make a sound
Says it's time to pay for the peace I've found
The peace I've found
Oh no, you want a holy war
Oh no, you want a holy war
Oh my God
You sank like a stone to the belly of the lake
I fear my fate
Is tethered to yours with no hope of escape
Oh my God
Sweet angel of rescue, please call me by name
Intercede
Please send me your virtue and I'll sink like a stone
I'll sink like a stone
Oh my God
You sank like a stone to the belly of the lake
I fear my fate
Is tethered to yours with no hope of escape
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
You sank like a stone to the belly of the lake
Bloodshot eyes see a man across the sea
Says he wants a holy war and he's coming for me
He's coming for me, he's coming for me
He's gonna bury me down where I won't make a sound
Says it's time to pay for the peace I've found, for the peace I've found
Oh no, you want a holy war
Oh no, you want a holy war
Oh no, you want a holy war
