Yeah, Oooo Yeah, Oooo

It ain't the things you say
What you do or where you stay
The car you're driving honey
It's only bought with money
It ain't the clothes you wear
Or the way you cut your hair
Your bling is novelty
Doesn't really mean much to me now

It ain't the money, honey
It ain't the things you buy me
It's just the way God loves me
The way his grace and love surrounds me
It ain't the idols, honey
It ain't the stars alignin'
You know it's God's love only
That turns life inside out now
You might also like
Things you tell me
La ah        x3

It ain't what you can't see
You can't believe what's on T.V
It ain't the science, honey
You can't buy that without me
It ain't the things you do
Or where you go that makes you cool
Your thousand Facebook friends
Won't stick it out til' the end

It ain't the money, honey
It ain't the things you buy me
It's just the way God loves me
The way his grace and love surrounds me
It ain't the idols, honey
It ain't the stars alignin'
You know it's God's love only
That turns life inside out now


I can see so clearly now
That my eyes have been open to a world that is broken
No more forsaken, I won't be taken again
Nothing's gonna' fool me anymore
It ain't the way you use your money
I love the way you put your arms, your arms, your arms around me
Ooooo baby baby, ba-ba baby baby, ba-ba babe
Oooo baby baby        x3

It ain't the money honey
It ain't the things you buy me

It ain't the money honey
It ain't the things you buy me
You know it's Gods love only
That turns life inside out now
It ain't the money, honey
It ain't the things you buy me
It ain't the idols, honey
It ain't the stars alignin'
You know it's God's love only
That turns life inside out now

It ain't the money, honey
It ain't the things you buy me
It's just the way God loves me
The way his grace and love surrounds me
It ain't the idols, honey
It ain't the stars alignin'
You know it's God's love only
That turns life inside out now

Now        x6
It ain't the money, the money, the money
It ain't, (yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
It ain't, it ain't (no now)
It ain't, it ain't, it ain't (yeah)
It ain't, it ain't, it ain't
It ain't
It ain't (The way, it's just the way, it's just the way, yeah)
(Fade)
It ain't
It ain't
It ain't (The way, It's just the way)
