Cuz I just wanna chill and take a ride
Shotgun in your 7-45
Oh baby you know I got your back, and I need to feel you next to me
We got a baby and you know that I
Would have another, man I want your child
Sometimes I really wanna cry, cause the love is so good

Boy, if you really love me now
Can we walk down the aisle?
Cause you know I'm gonna hold you down
Cause when you was down and out
I was still around
You gettin' money now
But I still got love for you

If you fell off tomorrow, you could stay at my crib
If you didn't smell so good, I would still have your kid
If you got locked up, I'd put money on your books
I'd marry you through conical visits, and it'd be off the hook
You could still keep the hoopty, if you couldn't cop a Benz
Boy I'd never dip out, like some of your friends
If the boys try to get you, I'd be by your side
Like Cleo from Set it Off, and you know I'll ride
If you gotta peel a cap baby, do it papi
And if a chick wanna a piece of me, I know you got me
You have to work at Mickey D's or Burger King
I'd be there for you cause I know we gotta eat
I ain't got too many friends, you know that babe
If you use your tongue, baby I'll behave
You know I don't drink, cause I wanna have your baby
Cause I'm your girl, and them other chicks is maybe
You might also like

If you only knew how I feel
Boy you would know that my love is for real
