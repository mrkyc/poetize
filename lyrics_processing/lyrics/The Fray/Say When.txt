I see you there, don't know where you come from
Unaware the stare from someone
Don't appear to care that I saw you and I want you
What's your name, 'cause I have to know it
You let me in and begin to show it
We're terrified 'cause we're heading straight for it, might get it

You've been the song playing on the background
All along but you're turning up now
And everyone is rising to meet you, to greet you
Turn around and you're walking toward me
I'm breaking down and you're breathing slowly
You say the word and I will be your man, your man

Say when and my own two hands
Will comfort you tonight, tonight
Say when and my own two arms
Will carry you tonight, tonight

We're coming close and then even closer
We bring it in, but we go no further
We're separate, two ghosts in one mirror, no nearer
Later on if it turns to chaos
Hurricane coming all around us
See the crack, pull it back from the window, you stay low
See The Fray LiveGet tickets as low as $80You might also like
Say when and my own two hands
Will comfort you tonight, tonight
Say when and my own two arms
Will carry you tonight, tonight

I come across you, lost and broken
You're coming to, but you're slow in waking
You start to shake, you still haven't spoken, what happened
They're coming back and you just dont know when
You want to cry but there's nothing coming
They're gonna push until you give in or say when

Now we're here, and it turns to chaos
Hurricane, coming all around us
Double crack throws you back from the window, you stay low
It all began with the man and country
Every plan turns another century
Around again, another nation has fallen

Maybe God can be on both sides
Of the gun, never understood why
Some of us never get it so good, so good
Some of this was here before us
All of this will go after us
It never stops until we give in, give in
Say when and my own two hands
Will comfort you tonight, tonight
Say when and my own two arms
Will carry you tonight, tonight
Say when and my own two hands
