We could slow down, waste away in this town
Standing on the sidewalk, watching this parade
Or we could get out, pack our suitcase right now
Find ourselves a bus stop, make our own way

'Cause it feels like I've been here forever
Afraid to be my father and afraid to leave him too
But it's my name painted on the doorway
Tells me where I came from and what I've got to do

Wherever this goes, no matter how far
Baby, you are the song that's written on my heart
Wherever we stand, wherever we fall
It don't matter at all 'cause I will be forever yours
From this moment 'til the day the curtains close
Wherever this goes

So we're here now, finally found our way out
On the road to someplace, someplace that we don't know
But it's alright, we'll keep on driving all night
Straight on through 'til morning, I know which way to go

'Cause it feels like we've been here forever
Don't know how much farther or where we're going to
But it's our name painted on the doorway
Tells us where we came from and what we got to do

Wherever this goes, no matter how far
Baby, you are the song that's written on my heart
Wherever we stand, wherever we fall
It don't matter at all 'cause I will be forever yours
From this moment 'til the day the curtains close
It don't matter at all 'cause I will be forever yours
Wherever this goes, no matter how far
Baby, you are the song that's written on my heart
Wherever we stand, wherever we fall
It don't matter at all 'cause I will be forever yours
From this moment 'til the day the curtains close
It don't matter at all 'cause I will be forever yours
Wherever this goes
Wherever this goes
