Home is where my head lays
On this pillow, on your chest
Here is where my heart stays
Even when it's not the best

And I can see all of the lights
And I can see the ugly sides
And it's nice
Mmm, it's nice

I keep finding
I keep finding something
I keep finding all your corners
I keep finding
I keep finding something
I keep finding all your corners
And it's nice

We are close and personal
It's a different point of view
Every turn is critical
Walking on the edge of you

I can see all of the lights
And I can see the other sides
And it's nice
Mmm, it's nice

I keep finding
I keep finding something
I keep finding all your corners
I keep finding
I keep finding something
I keep finding all your corners
When everything you love goes bad
You love 'em 'til they love you back
It doesn't matter what we said
I'll never stop loving you back
Never stop loving you

I'm falling
Ever since you came
Are you all in or have you changed?
I'm callin' for you name
Are you? Are you?
No matter where the wind may blow
I wanna be there when you're old
I'm falling
Since you came
Are you? Are you?
I keep finding
I keep finding something
I keep finding all your corners
I keep finding
I keep finding something
I keep finding all your corners
When everything you love goes bad
You love 'em 'til they love you back
It doesn't matter what we said
I'll never stop loving you back
I'll never stop loving you

When everything you love goes bad
You love until they love you back
It doesn't matter what we said
I'll never stop loving you back
