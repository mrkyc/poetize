Baby who was the one who treated you so bad
That you felt that you
Had to do to me what she had done to you
Now you prove everything that my friend had
To read about you was true, now it's over and we're through

You thought that you'd play me
And have things your way
So can you blame me
For walking away
What did I do to
Be treated so bad (Treated so bad)
Now you have lost me
And I was the best thing you'd ever had

Now you think that I don't know what's going on (What's going on)
But I know with you I just keep wasting my time
I can't keep holding on
(Cause i know with you) Cause I know with you I just keep wasting my time

Can't you see
That the things you said and did
Never happened, made believe
That you saw something special inside of me
Now you seem to think
That you can't live your life without me
Sorry baby you can't do this to me
You might also like
You thought that you'd play me
And have things your way
So can you blame me
For walking away (Walking away)
What did I do to
Be treated so bad (So bad)
Now you have lost me
And I was the best thing you'd ever had

And you think that I don't know what's going on
But I know with you I just keep wasting my time
I can't keep holding on
But I know I just keep wasting my time
And you think that I don't know what's going on (I don't know what's going on)
But I know with you I just be wasting my time (You i just be wasting my time on you yeah)
I can't keep holding on (Cause i know)
But I know with you i just be wasting my time

Now you know that
I can live without you
You should see that it's not all about you
This time you played too many games
Now it's time to see
That I won't waste my life no not me
And you think that I don't know what's going on
But I know with you I just keep wasting my time
I can't keep holding on
But I know I just keep wasting my time
And you think that I don't know what's going on
But I know with you I just be wasting my time (Wasting my time on you yeah)
I can't keep holding on
But I know I you i just be wasting my time
I don't know what's going on (I dont know what's going on)
But I know with you I just keep wasting my time
I can't keep holding on
But I know with you i be wasting my time (Cause l know with you)
And you think that I don't know what's going on
But I know with you I just be wasting my time
I can't keep holding on
But I know I just be wasting my time (Cause i know with you)
