Ah, yeah
Oh, yeah

We've got something kinda funny goin' on (We got it, yeah hey)
We've got something kinda funny goin' on

Wherever you're going, high or low
Remember to sure enjoy the show
So climb aboard my journey deep inside
Better late than dead on time

Ooh, it's you I know that I have got to feed, yeah, yeah
Ooh, don't take from me more than you really need
More than you really need

We've got something kinda funny goin' on (We got it)
We've got something kinda funny goin' on (We got it, oh)

Happiness is just a state of your mind
Keep searching, who knows what you may find
Rules are for fools, and fool's paradise is hard to find
Play my game or get left behind
You might also like
Ooh, it's you I know that I have got to feed, yeah, yeah
Ooh, take from me what you feel that you need
You feel that you need
