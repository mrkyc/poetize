You thought that this was love
But my plan, wasn't that for us
I thought that you would understand
I didn't want you for my full-time man, yeah yeah

I like the way you made me feel that night
It's something that I can't deny
But I've been hurt before
I can't take it no more
That's why, that's why

A weekend love is all it was (All it was)
Nothing serious because
We're playing games, we're only young (Ooh)
Get with it, it was just a weekend love (Just a weekend love)

You thought you'd break the rules
You thought that I would be your fool
But now that the tables have turned
This is a lesson you didn't want to learn, learn
You might also like
I liked the way you make me feel inside
It's something I just had to try
But I've been hurt before
I can't take it no more
That's why, that's why

A weekend love is all it was (That's all it was for me)
Nothing serious because (Serious, just because)
We're playing games, we're only young (Games we're only young)
Get with it, it was just a weekend love (Just a weekend love)
A weekend love is all it was (Just a weekend love, that's all, it was)
Nothing serious because (Nothing serious because)
We're playing games we're only young (We're only, oooh, na-na na na)
Get with it, it was just a weekend love (A weekend love)

Don't try to make me believe that you'd never hurt someone
Now that pain has come back to you
Thought the love you had was true
And now you don't know what to do, oh

Every time I turn around you're standing right there
I really don't want you and I really don't care
I can't think about you no not forever
What we had was good but there's much more better
You try to blame me, I'll put the blame on you
You play the game baby, I can play the game too
You say you want me back it's a simple fact
Darkchild and all my girls got my back like that, yeah
A weekend love is all it was (Love)
Nothing serious because (Serious because)
We're playing games, we're only young (Ooh-yeah, games 'cause we're only young)
Get with it, it was just a weekend love (Ooh-whoa, ah-ah, ah-ah)
A weekend love is all it was (Love is it all it was)
Nothing serious because (Serious because)
We're playing games, we're only young (Games we're only young)
Get with it, it was just a weekend love (Just a weekend, a little weekend love)
