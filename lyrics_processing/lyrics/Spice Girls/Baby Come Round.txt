Hey come round and remember
How it started up, oh-oh
Cause no one wants to be a one hit wonder
Why can't we
Work it out? (ah-ah)
Who called who? I before you? (ah-ah)
Who made the move?
You know it takes two (ah-ah)
Bumpin' in to you, was it all down to me? (ah-ah)
Time for you to come around

So baby come round, come round come round
To my way of lovin' (oh-whoa-oh)
So baby come round, come round come round
To my way of lovin' (oh-whoa-oh)

Butterflies have passed us by
Gotta get the feeling back, oh
Taking each other for granted (hey-hey-eh)
I know that we can
Work it out
I wind you up like a brand new toy
I've had enough
I'm over wound
Got to give it up, I know your game
Time for you to come around
You might also like
So baby come round, come round come round
To my way of lovin' (oh-whoa-oh)
So baby come round, come round come round
To my way of lovin' (oh-whoa-oh)

(So baby come round, come round)
Come round, come round
(So baby come round, come round)
Come round, come round
(So baby come round, come round)
Come round, come round
(So baby come round, come round)
Oh-whoa-oh
(So baby come round, come round)
Come round, come round
(So baby come round, come round)
Come round, come round
(So baby come round, come round)
Come round, come round
(So baby come round, come round)
To my way of lovin'

So baby come round, round
I'll show you what your missin'
Now or never, I hung around forever
I'm a fly by the seat of my pants girl, see
I got better thing to do than waste my time looking for you
It's like this, I'll take you nice and slow
Unless you don't wanna know then maybe I'll just let you go
It takes two to get it on and on
Come round and round

So baby come round, come round come round
To my way of lovin' (oh-whoa-oh)
So baby come round, come round come round
To my way of lovin' (oh-whoa, come round)

So baby come round, come round come round
Come around, to my way-hey, I said my way-hey, come round
So baby come round, come round come round
