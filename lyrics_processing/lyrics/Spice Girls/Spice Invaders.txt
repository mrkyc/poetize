Hello, um, about... I can't believe my... aaahhh
It's um, it's a mad woman. Get lost!
Melanie's always on the phone
I'm not always on the phone! I used to be always on the phone
But now I'm not cause I've got ear rot

Where's Geri and Mel at this point?
I think they're asleep
I thought it was a bit quiet
No, Geri's writin' a poem under a tree somewhere
No she's hugging that tree. Hug that tree, Geri!
You'd never guess what, you'd never believe this. Alright listen to this
Oh... what is it, Geri?
Oooh... what is it? Listen, listen listen. What is it? What is it?
Friendship often survives the relationship from which it was neglected
What?
Ignoring your conscience allows you to justify everything!
Don't you agree?
Geri, is you readin' that out of a book?
Yeah. Ha ha
(humming) (Emma & Victoria)
(ba, ba, bam) (Geri & Mel C)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la AHHHH!!!!!
That's what you got to do when you get really stressed, you just
Go AHHHH!!!!!

You're so cute. Ginger! You're just so cute
Alright Ginge, how's your... beep!

Well, there's nothing wrong with being ginger
There is nothing wrong. I'm out of a bottle anyway
Ha ha ha (Mel C and Geri)
(humming) Baby, Posh and Ginger and we've got Scary and Sporty! Yeah!
(humming) (Emma & Victoria)
Mixed together in a cooking pot, you have the Spice Girls! (Mel B & Geri)
(humming) (Emma, Victoria & Mel B)
Ba, ba, blah
(humming) (Emma & Victoria)
I want that Indian bit to come again. Where is it?
Ahh... we are the chosen ones...
(humming) (Emma & Victoria)
It didn't last very long, did it?
(ba, ba, bam) (Geri & Mel C)
(scatting) Lift your knee up, tap it to the left. Gonna lift
Your knee up, tap it to the left
That could be a new dance
(humming) (Emma & Victoria)
(ba, ba, bam) (Geri & Mel C)
Ha, ha. We don't wanna get in trouble now do we? No... I don't
Know what you mean by that, though. I... you know... we're not trying to be offensive...
(ba, ba, bam) (Geri & Mel C)
(humming) (Emma & Victoria)
Exactly...
Exactly, exactly
I quite like that
