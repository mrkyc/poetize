Let me tell you
'Bout the night I wanna
Have gotta show you
How you gonna make it last
Are you ready
We're not taking it too fast
Trust in me what you need
And release a part of me

So tonight, gonna take you on a ride
And you better make it right
'Cause tonight, there's only one thing on my mind
And you'll find out just in time

If you knew
Just what the night has got in store for you
You wouldn't leave the room until I'm through
I'm tired of being undercover
It's time to be your lover
So get down with me

Let me know what
What is going through your mind
Does it show
How I'm feeling deep inside
Hold me close
Now that you know how it goes
We can do it again
And this night will never end

We have been together
For a night
It's time
For you and I
To say goodbye
Don't try
To hold on this moment
'Cause when you wake up I'll be gone
Yeh, yeh, yeh

Just what the night has got in store for you
You wouldn't leave the room until I'm through

If you knew
Just what the night has got in store for you
You wouldn't leave the room until I'm through
