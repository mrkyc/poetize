I've never had a felling so right
Like I had with you
Can't explain the things you do
But boy, when you tell me softly you love me too
It's like I know we were meant to be
So for eternity
You will have a part of me
All I need is for you to stay right here with me, yeah

Time goes by, but we stand still (Know it does, I know it does)
Love you for eternity I will (I will)
I know that we were meant to be (We were meant to be my love)
That's how I feel when you're with me

You are the reason that my heart beats
And no, I never thought I will ever fall so deep
But know I see that the love
That we share is all so sweet
What if I told you that I believe? (Believe)
That you are my soul, my destiny (My destiny, yeah)
What if I was to say I every way
Deep in my heart is where you'll be
You might also like
Time goes by, but we stand still (I am still right here)
Love you for eternity I will (I'll never go)
I know that we were meant to be (We were meant to be)
That's how I feel when you're with me (How I feel when you're with me)
Time goes by, but we stand still (Oh time, oh time)
Love you for eternity I will (Eternity I will)
I know that we were meant to be (We were meant baby, love)
That's how I feel when you're with me

As you hold me close so tenderly
And I watch you fall to sleep
I see in you the one who now
Completes the half of me I used to be

(Yeah, yeah) Time goes by, but we stand still
Love you for eternity I will (Eternity I will)
I know that we were meant to be (We're meant to be)
That's how I feel when you're with me (Feel when you're, when you're with me baby)
Time goes by, but we stand still (But we always stand still babe)
Love you for eternity I will (Stand still babe, and I know)
I know that we were meant to be (Yes we were)
That's how I feel when you're with me
Time goes by but we stand still
Love you for eternity I will
I know that we were meant to be
