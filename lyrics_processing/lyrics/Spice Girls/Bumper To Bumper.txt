I'll beep my horn for you
Bumper to bumper
Give way I'm comin' through
I'll beep my horn for you
Bumper to bumper
Give way I'm comin' through

Drivin' through the city
Dirty, nitty gritty
Lookin' for a place to go
Girls are feelin' risky
Feelin' kinda frisky
Come on baby, let me know

Pull over, pull over
You're drivin' me reckless
Over the limit
Alright, you're gonna get this
Bumper to bumper
Bumper to bumper
I want to drive your body
All night
I want a back seat lover
All right
You might also like
You know that
I'll beep my horn for you
Bumper to bumper
Give way I'm comin' through
Bumper to bumper
I'll beep my horn for you
Bumper to bumper
Can't take my eyes off you
Bumper to-

Looking but no stoppin'
Only window shoppin'
'Less you've got some goods to show
Don't tell us that we're dirty
Only bein' flirty
Top's off and down and here we go

Pull over, pull over
You're drivin' me reckless
Over the limit
Alright, you're gonna get this
Bumper to bumper
Bumper to bumper
I want to drive your body
All night
I want a back seat lover
All right
You know that
I'll beep my horn for you
Bumper to bumper
Give way I'm comin' through
Bumper to bumper
I'll beep my horn for you
Bumper to bumper
Can't take my eyes off you
Bumper to bumper
