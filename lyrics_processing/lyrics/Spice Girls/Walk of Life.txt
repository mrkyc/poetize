I'm steppin' out into the walk of life
Hold tight, the vibe is rough
Feel the heat that's in the air
People watchin' everywhere
Rush hour, slow it down
Stop and listen to the summer sound
Playing in the park and street talkin'
London Town is walkin', walkin'

London Town is walkin'
I said it's really talkin' yeah
Steppin' in the walk of life
I said makin' out the walk of life
London Town I'm stalkin'
I said I'm really walkin' yeah

The sun goes down and the lights come up
So we move on to a club
Surround yourself with the feel-good groove
People dancin' everywhere
Make your move, go turn it up
Ride the rhythm of the 
Swingin' in the dark and heart bumpin'
London Town is thumpin'
I said it was jumpin'

The sun is risin', but we haven't slept
I'm not ready to rest my head yet
Huddle close till you get no air
See the crew down Leicester Square
Night crawler's mornin' dew
People watchin', is it you?
Jump the bus and fare hoppin'
London Town's still buzzin'
Oh it's really buzzin' yeah
