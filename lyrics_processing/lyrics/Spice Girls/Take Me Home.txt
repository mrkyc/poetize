There's no place I call height
There's no mainstream
There's no happy medium
There's no in between
So do your searchin' until you're down
Then realize you're on home ground

Sittin' in a white room dreaming of a life
You have got me thinkin' what is paradise?
Should I take an ocean drive, coolin' from the sun?
Silver screen got me thinking this is how it should be done

Take me home
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah
Take me home
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah

Stand together alone, not knowin' who you are
Friendly stranger, strangely friendly
Would you keep me warm?
Would you keep me warm?
You might also like
You know, you can be your paradise
And I can keep me warm
You can have your own dream life
Step into your comfort zone
Comfort zone

Take me home
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah
Take me home
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah

Ain't nobody to take me home
'Cause I'm here, yes where I belong
I may leave 'cause I'm on my way
But my home it will always stay
Ain't nobody to take me home
'Cause I'm here, yes where I belong
I may leave 'cause I'm on my way
But my home it will always stay

So we're all just free-falling fools, huh?
Out of time
You got yours, I got mine
Should all this be so precious?
Maybe I should be a little humble?
Slave to fear, 'cause I could stumble
So do your searching until you're down
'Cause you're on home ground
Take me home
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah
Take me home
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah
Take me home
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah
Take me home
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah
Take me home
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah
