Ow
One of these girls is doin' their own thing
Oh oh
One of these girls is just not the same

We think she's sweet and pretty in pink
But you better beware, 'cause I ain't what you think
I'm always searchin' for a good time, night and day
She gets down in unusual ways
Gettin' my kicks, bein' naughty and cheeky
(Dream on, babe you're just freaky)

But when we got together
We just come as one
Doin' mmm, mmm
And a-whoa yeah

One of these girls is doin' their own thing
One of these girls is just not the same
I said ah-
Even though we're all doin' our own thing
Can't you see we're all playin' a game
(Oh oh)
You might also like
Takin' pride in myself and the clothes that I wear
She's only teasin' to make you stare
She likes to do what the boys do
Getting dirty on the pitch, chanting with the cup crew

But when we got together
We just come as one
Doin' mmm, mmm
And a-whoa yeah

One of these girls is doin' their own thing
One of these girls is just not the same
I said ah-
Even though we're all doin' our own thing
Can't you see we're all playin' a game
(Oh oh)

Pushin' in the clubs, queue jumpin'
Givin' all the boys a grief
Givin' lots of cheek and attitude
Keepin' our lovin' brief
Pushin' in the clubs, queue jumpin'
Givin' all the boys a grief
Givin' lots of cheek and attitude
Keepin' our lovin' brief
Do you think they've got it?
Well I've got it
You've always had it
No way, they won't get it
Ah, come on
(Oh!)

But when we got together
We just come as one
Doin' mmm, mmm
And a-whoa yeah

One of these girls is doin' their own thing

I said ah-
Even though we're all doin' our own thing
Can't you see we're all playin' a game (Ginger and Baby: playin' a-oh)
