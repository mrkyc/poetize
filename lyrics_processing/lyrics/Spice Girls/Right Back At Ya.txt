Oh, oh, oh, ah
Oh, oh, oh, ah
We're coming right back at ya, come on
This party's begun, jump to it

It's a brand new day
I've got a feeling things are goin' my way
'Cause the girls are back in town
So don't look down
'Cause the groove won't let your feet touch the ground, yeah yeah
No lookin' back
And you thought we wouldn't make it this far
So we proved you wrong again
Now's the time
We're coming right back with a brand new design, feeling fine

There's been tears along the way
But we're still the best of friends
Never needed to pretend
'Cause real friendship never ends

We're comin' right back at ya, come on
This party's begun
Jump to it 'cause the girls are comin' back again
Right back at ya, this time
We're changing the vibe
Get with it, cause the girls are comin' back again
Woah oh oh woah oh oh
'Cause the girls are coming back again
You might also like
Now, we've had a taste of what we all can achieve
But we're comin' back for more
To show you how
To turn your dreams into a reality
Stronger than before

There's been tears along the way
But we never cried alone
The four of us have grown
And our friendship never ends

We're comin' right back at ya, come on
This party's begun
Jump to it cause the girls are comin' back again
Right back at ya, this time
We're changing the vibe
Get with it, cause the girls are comin' back again

We're coming right back at ya, no R-I-P
Not forgetting the days when we were all Wannabes
Spice it up through and through, through and through to the limit
They all try and diss us but there ain't nothing in it
We started a trend that they all imitated
A new generation of spice we created
You all know who you are we couldn't have done it without ya
So once again we're coming right back at ya
There's been tears along the way
But we're still the best of friends
Never needed to pretend
'Cause real friendship never ends

We're comin' right back at ya, come on
This party's begun
Jump to it 'cause the girls are comin' back again
Right back at ya, this time
We're changing the vibe
Get with it, 'cause the girls are comin' back again
Right back at ya, come on
This party's begun
Jump to it cause the girls are comin' back again
Right back at ya, this time
We're changing the vibe
Get with it cause the girls are comin' back again
Right back at ya, come on
This party's begun
Jump to it 'cause the girls are comin' back again
Right back at ya, this time
We're changing the vibe
