At the party after the show
I see a face I want to get to know
Wink wink nudge nudge
Tell me do you like the rudest stuff
Show me how you're gonna make your move
Boy you know you got a lot to prove
Wink wink nudge nudge
Are you man enough?

You got the message you felt my stare
And now you're walking from over there
I ain't that easy I'll make it hard
For you
(Ooh, sugar)

If you wanna have some fun
Track me down and get my number
You could be the one (Something on your mind)
If you wanna have some fun
Track me down and get my number
You could be the one (Something on your mind)

Now you're standing real close to me
I feel your heat you wanna get with me
Wink wink nudge nudge
Tell me do you like the rudest stuff
I love the feeling wanna make it right
Babe I'm gonna keep you up all night
Wink wink nudge nudge
Are you man enough?
