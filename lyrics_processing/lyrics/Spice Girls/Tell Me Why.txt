Spice Girls, Darkchild
Let's dance

Ooh, we could have had it all
But you turned your back

It started with dreams
It started a team
But you weren't as true as you always seemed
You promised to love
No matter what
Yet you turned your back and walked out on me

What made you think
That without me
Your life would be so much better but now you see (Oh, but now you see)
That without me
Your hopes and dreams (Your hopes and dreams)
Will never be as good as what you had with me

So tell me why, oh why
Did we end up this way?
When we tried, we tried
To make everything okay (Oh)
Tell me why, oh why
Did you feel you couldn't stay?
When we could have stayed together
But you wanted it this way
You might also like
You never thought
That I would find out
All of the things you said about us
When you're the one who decided to
Erase all our plans and say you are through

What made you think
That without me
Your life would be so much better (So much better) but now you see (But now you see)
That without me
Your hopes and dreams (They will never)
Will never be as good as what you had with me (Had with me)

So tell me why, oh why
Did we end up this way?
When we tried, we tried
To make everything okay
Tell me why, oh why
Did you feel you couldn't stay?
When we could have stayed together
But you wanted it this way
So tell me why, oh why
Did we end up this way?
When we tried, we tried
To make everything okay
Tell me why, oh why
Did you feel you couldn't stay?
When we could have stayed together
But you wanted it this way
Now tell me was it your plan all along
To try and use me and then let go
Now where is the trust we had between us?
I guess that you never played by the rules
Can you tell me?

So tell me why, oh why
Did we end up this way?
When we tried, we tried
To make everything okay
Tell me why, oh why
Did you feel you couldn't stay?
When we could have stayed together
But you wanted it this way
So tell me why, oh why
Did we end up this way?
When we tried, we tried
To make everything okay
Tell me why, oh why
Did you feel you couldn't stay?
When we could have stayed together
But you wanted it this way
Tell me why, oh why
Did we end up this way?
When we tried, we tried
To make everything okay
Tell me why, oh why
Did you feel you couldn't stay?
When we could have stayed together
