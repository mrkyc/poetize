This is definitely my most favourite time of the year
Oh yeah mine too, yes, I think it is
It is mine yeah
I reckon Christmas is all right, cause like the football season is still on
And you can watch football on Boxing Day when everyone is being really
Boring and, you're fed up of your presents
Listen right you can do whatever you want at Christmas as long as it's good, man
Well what I say this Christmas is just do what you want
But make sure you do it like a lady!
If you can't be good, be careful
(and a ring-ding-a-ding-ding-ding-ding)
And make sure you get all your pressies off Santa!

Just hear those sleigh bells jing-a-ling
Ring-ting-a-ling-a-ling-ting
(Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding)
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
(Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding)
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling yoo-hoo
(Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding)
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
(Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding)

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, and cozy are we
(Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding)
Let's snuggle up together like birds of a feather would be
(Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding)
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
(Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding)

Remember to go to sleep on Christmas Eve otherwise Santa
(He won't come)
Or stay up the whole night
No! You can't do that 'cause Father Christmas won't come then
You've gotta go to sleep
Father Christmas doesn't exist now!
Sssssshhhhhh!
He does Vicki (Yes he does)
What are you talking about? (You can't say that)
Vicki that's terrible to say
We know cause we went to Lapland and we saw him
I know you might not get what you want but you're gonna get a hit in the
Face if you don't shut up
If not you'll get a bag of soot
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, and cozy are we
