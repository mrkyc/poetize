You could set me free
Come on, set me free
We could dance 'neath the pale moonlight
Feeling good tonight
Feeling good tonight
Please somebody's got to get me to the action
Some satisfaction is what I've been searching for
Got to find myself a happy situation
Some celebration
Somebody who calls for more

Hey hey
Get down
It'd be nice to realize a little romance
I could dig some slow dance
I could dig some girl-meets-boy
Can't put too much time in searching for some reason
Must be the season
For doin' that jump for joy
