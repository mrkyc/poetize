He was bad, he was clean
Dressed to kill that is wrapped on me
I can't kill, coz that's all I understand Wowow
He was gone, left me blue
We both know how long we've been through
What Am I?
Convenient love for you! Wow!
Yes, no! It hurts me so
Heart is weak, but mind is gone
Do you dance?
What is life without a sweet romance
I took a chance and I said yes
At time when I needed love
I opened my heart
Let it all in
I lived the dream hey
I love the wonder
I said yes
Where it goes?
Honey no one knows
Now I'm free
To finally meet true happiness
And so, I confess I said yes
Must confess
He'd say yes
I said Y-E-S
Wowow
With my heels
Had some fun
Dance and dance
Till the morning sun
It's so good
When love flows like it should
Watch me by fly
Fast and high
Far away from the tears I've cried
Tears that prove
We live in an awful groove
I made a move and
I said yes
And at time when I needed love
I opened my heart
Let it all in
I lived the dream hey
I loved the wonder
I said yes
Where it goes?
Honey no one knows
Now I'm free
To finally meet
True happiness
And so I confess
I said yes
He'd say yes (He'd say yes)
I said yes
Oh, I said Y-E-S
I took a chance
And I said yes
And at time when I needed love
I opened my heart
Let it all in
I lived the dream hey
I loved the wonder
I said yes!
Oh, oh, I said yes!
And at time when I needed love
I opened my heart
Let it all in
I lived the dream hey
I loved the wonder
