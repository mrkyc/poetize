You are the calm
Whenever the storm is raging
Whenever the world gets crazy
All I keep asking lately
You are the same
When everything else is changing
When all of the walls are caving
Whenever I needed saving
You were there

Nothing lasts forever
Even time, it runs away
But you and I can prove them wrong
'Cause I still feel the same

And when you hold me
Love me slowly
When everything is changing
I know we never will
'Cause when I hold you in my arms
We can make time stand still

And you are the stars
You're lighting the space around you
As bright as the day I found you
When all of the lights fade out, there's you
And you are the sun
And you are forever burning
As long as my world's been turning
You're the only thing that's turning
You might also like
Nothing lasts forever
Even time, it runs away
But you and I can prove them wrong
'Cause I still feel the same

And when you hold me
Love me slowly
When everything is changing
I know we never will
'Cause when I hold you in my arms
We can make time stand still

Love me slowly
Love me slowly
We can make time stand still
Love me slowly
When you hold me
We can make time stand still

And baby I'm so glad you're mine
I love everything about you
Don't wanna live without you
And as the years go passing by
And if this world falls down around us
There will still be you and I
And when you hold me
Love me slowly
When everything is changing
I know we never will
'Cause when I hold you in my arms
When you hold me
Love me slowly
When everything is changing
I know we never will
'Cause when I hold you in my arms
