You give me a new sensation
Something that I've never felt before
You give me the inspiration
Give me everything I need and more
Defying the explanation
You're the rhythm deep within my soul, oh
And every time I'm with ya
Every touch just makes me lose control
And I wanna let go

'Cause the way you give it to me
With everything that you've got
You've started something and I don't want it to stop
I want your body on me
Baby, I can't get enough
Come on and give it to me
Just give me your love

Just give me your love, oh
Just give me your love
You give me your love, oh, yeah

Can't imagine my life without ya
And I don't ever wanna be apart
And whenever I think about ya
You send a lightning bolt straight to my heart, yeah
But baby my pulse is racing
Feel your rhythm deep within my soul, oh
And baby, you know I feel ya
Every touch just makes me lose control
And I wanna lose control 'cause
You might also like
'Cause the way you give it to me
With everything that you've got
You've started something and I don't want it to stop
I want your body on me
Baby, I can't get enough
Come on and give it to me
Just give me your love

Just give me your love, oh
Just give me your love
You give me your love, oh, yeah
