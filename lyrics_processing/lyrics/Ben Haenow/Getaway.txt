Ooh, ooh, ooh

Nothing ever happens around here
Need to find our way out of these worn-out surroundings
That we kicked around in
Back when we thought
That we'd do something good with our lives
Oh, 'cause look at us now, yeah
With the time running out, we're sat wasting away
Thinking back to the days when
We always said that we'd do so much more with our lives

Let's start today
In the cover of darkness
We'll make our escape

'Cause we're wide-awake tonight
As we leave this tired town behind
Ain't no time to waste tonight
'Cause they won't wait to be found
We'll make our getaway
We've still got dreams to chase
You might also like
Brand new hopes, new horizons
Ain't no clouds in our skies
Ain't no holding us down in this place that we found
We can see everything now
And we opened our eyes
Such a beautiful sight
Brand new stories to write
And yeah, we can be all that we wanted to be
It's taken some time but I'm so glad that we've realised

It's never too late
Don't ever give up on those dreams that we made

'Cause we're wide-awake tonight
As we leave this tired town behind
Ain't no time to waste tonight
'Cause they won't wait to be found
We'll make our getaway

And I know that it's hard
To be all that you are
Though the skies may be dark
We can reach for the stars
'Cause we're wide-awake tonight
As we leave this tired town behind
Ain't no time to waste tonight
'Cause they won't wait to be found
'Cause we're wide-awake tonight
As we leave this tired town behind
Ain't no time to waste tonight
'Cause they won't wait to be found
We'll make our getaway
We've still got dreams to chase
