I guess this isn't our place
I guess you made all the running, baby
But I couldn't finish the race
You've been trying to hide it
And I've been missing the signs
While you were crossing your fingers and hoping
I've just been crossing the lines
And if you gotta go, then I get it
If you're gonna leave, then goodbye
And there'll be no chance to forget it
We are connected, you and I
As long as you make it back to me
Take all the time you need
You can love who you want
You can love till you don't even think about me
As long as you make it back to me
Right now I'm not what you need
I can learn to be more than who I was before, wait and see
Just make it back to me
Are you better without me?
Are you falling apart?
Are you reaching the end of the story?
'Cos I'm trying to rewrite the start
You might also likeAnd if you gotta go, then I get it
If you gotta leave, then goodbye
There'll be no chance to forget it, oh
We are connected, you and I
As long as you make it back to me
Take all the time you need
You can love who you want
You can love till you don't even think about me
As long as you make it back to me
Right now I'm not what you need
I can learn to be more than who I was before
Wait and see
Just make it back to me
For all the times I let you down
And said I never would
I'll right those wrongs, turn it around
And love you like I should
For all the times I let you down
And said I never would
I'll right those wrongs, turn it around
And love you like I should
As long as you make it back to me
Take all the time you need
You can love who you want
You can love till you don't even think about me
As long as you make it back to me
Right now I'm not what you need
I can learn to be more than who I was before
Wait and see
