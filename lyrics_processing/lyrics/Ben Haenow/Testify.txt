When the world keeps telling me lies
When I feel like there's no you
I just take one look in your eyes
And it's all depending on you, oh no
And you like it when I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
And I like it when you hold me close and show me, I'd pray
Your love can make me stronger, take the pain away
And your love can make me better, better
Baby let me testify, I wanna testify 'til it breaks me 'cause
Your love can make me stronger, make it all okay
And your love can make me better, better
Baby let me testify, I wanna testify 'til it breaks me 'cause
I've given up my pride
And I'll be sanctified
Baby, let me testify
When I falter, you are my faith
When I'm doubting, you are my real
And when I thought that things would never change
You made me change the way that I feel, oh oh
And you like it when I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
And I like it when you hold me close and show me, I'd pray
