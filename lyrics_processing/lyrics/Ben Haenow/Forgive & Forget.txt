It's funny how the nighttime
Brings to light a darker side of me
And I've never found the right lines
I'm always sayin' things that I don't mean
And I know I never made time
It's only now that I've begun to see (whoa)
While I was out there searching
What I'm lookin' for was right in front of me, yeah

So, it's taken time
To realize what I gave up
'Cause it's so clear now what I couldn't see back then (oh yeah)

If I could take it back
If I could take it back
Oh, I'm sorry for the stupid things I said
If you forgive me, babe, I won't forget
If I could take it back

I know you were my lifeline
But you don't know what you got 'til it's not there
And now I finally see that I
Said the things I did 'cause I was scared
You might also like
Oh, it's taken time to realize what I gave up
'Cause it's so clear now what I couldn't see back then
What I didn't know back then

If I could take it back
If I could take it back
Oh, I'm sorry for the stupid things I said
If you forgive me, babe, I won't forget
If I could take it back (If I could take it back)
If I could take it back (I would take it back, yeah)
Oh, I'm sorry for the stupid things I said
If you forgive me babe I won't forget (If you forgive me baby)

So, if you take me back, you know I wouldn't ever let you go
'Cause baby I don't want to be alone
Oh, if I could take back all I said
Me and you could start again
You know that I can't do this on my own

If I could take it back
If I could take it back
Oh, I'm sorry for the stupid things I said
If you forgive me, babe, I won't forget
If I could take it back (if I could take it back)
If I could take it back (oh oh I would take it back, yeah)
Oh, I'm sorry for the stupid things I said
If you forgive me, babe, I won't forget
