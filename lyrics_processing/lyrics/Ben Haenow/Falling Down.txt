I been tryn'a keep it together
Hoping everything will get better
But everything is coming apart right now, now, now, oh no
And I know I always said I could save ya
And you always told me I was a failure
If that's just me, then I can't see

'Cause who the hell am I anyway?
I've forgotten everything but a name
And now the weather's starting to change
And I just wanna run and hide away, yeah
'Cause I'm too weak to keep it together
I guess the sun can't shine all the time

When everything is falling down around me like rain
You're my shelter
When I can't find the strength to fight from washing away
In the flood

I tried picking up the pieces
But my hands are bleeding
I'm in need of help, oh yeah yeah
And I know I always said I could save ya
But the pressure's got me starting to waiver
And I can't believe it's broken me, but
You might also like
Who the hell am I anyway?
I've forgotten everything but a name
And now the weather's starting to change
And I just wanna run and hide away, yeah
'Cause I'm too weak to keep it together
I guess the sun can't shine all the time

When everything is falling down around me like rain
You're my shelter
When I can't find the strength to fight from washing away
In the flood

When I can't hold on
I'm losing it all again
You keep me strong
You're there when I need a friend, oh yeah

When everything is falling down around me like rain
You're my shelter
When I can't find the strength to fight from washing away
In the flood, yeah yeah
When everything is falling down around me like rain
You're my shelter
When I can't find the strength to fight from washing away
In the flood
When I can't hold on
I'm losing it all again
You keep me strong
You're there when I need a friend, oh yeah
