Forget about the in-between
We could write the ending scene
Hey, I already feel much better
Knowing I got time to breathe
Knowing that you're right there for me
You can hold together 'less you're falling apart
You can black out the stars
'less you can see in the dark
Find the missing pieces
Gon' get back what I lost
I don't wanna wait no more
I don't wanna wait no more
Hey
I'll fix my heart
Remove these scars
So when you show up
I'll be ready for you
Closed up or here
Get a hold for real
So when you get here
I'll be ready for you
Hey, ain't it a funny thing
Words could move on the wall
But to you they say it all
Hey, so I'm taking in
Don't count the days
Make the days count, yeah
