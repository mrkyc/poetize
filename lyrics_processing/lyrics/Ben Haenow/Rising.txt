Oh, you tried to deny but you just can't fight the truth
I wouldn't be half the man that I am if it weren't for you
When I'm lost in the night, I don't think I can make it through
I can see in the dark with the light that I find in you
When the weight of the world gets me down and I'm feeling blue
You lift me up with your love to a place with a brighter view
Oh, and nobody else makes me feel like the way you do

When I'm here in your arms
There's no way that they can't break through
When I'm here in your arms
There's a place that you take me to, yeah

I can feel us rising
We're leaving the ground
No one can reach us
This place that we found
So much higher, higher
You lift me up with your love
Baby, we're still rising, yeah yeah

See, everyday I'm amazed by you, babe, and the love we found
Leave the world far behind as we fly to a higher ground
And I won't be afraid that you'll stray when I'm not around
You might also like
'Cause so many wanna hold you
But all they do is hold you down
Oh, so many wanna hold you
But all they do is hold you down

I can feel us rising
We're leaving the ground
No one can reach us
This place that we found
So much higher, higher
You lift me up with your love (with your love)

We ain't never coming down, never coming down
Never coming down
We ain't never coming down, never coming down
Never coming down

I can feel us rising
We're leaving the ground (leaving the ground)
No one can reach us
This place that we found (this place that we found)
So much higher, higher (Feel so high)
You lift me up with your love
And baby, we're still rising
We ain't never coming down, never coming down
