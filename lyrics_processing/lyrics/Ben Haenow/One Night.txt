But I'm standing in the rain
Don't care if every drop's a dagger
Cause I need you back again
And oh, I thought my star was rising
But baby now I've paid the price
Cause everything I love is burning
From one roll of the dice
Why do we fall into love
When all we do is run into trouble
I don't know why I gambled on your heart
Cause it got lost in the struggle, yeah
Just give me one night
I'd risk everything
One night
I'd risk everything
One night
To win you back again
Things will be worse before they're better
When you find out what I've done
You're gonna strike me down with lightening
But it still don't mean I'll run
Baby I'm begging for forgiveness
I confess I done you wrong
Its true, I always played the joker
But my queen of hearts is gone
You might also likeWhy do we fall into love

One night
To win you back again
Tell me you forgive me so

Tell me that you love me so
