Nothing I can do but let go
Rush you with a cold white water
Trying to stay afloat
We keep fighting with the tide to get us back to how we had it before
Trying to make you see what I can see you don't believe anymore
But something's changed in us
And I can feel you slipping away
Like the sunlight at the end of the day
I can feel you slipping away
Like the sunlight at the end of the day
Hey, hold on brother
Wait, it's not over
Whatever comes between us I know we can make it right in the end
The river keeps running but were gonna find each other again
So hold on
Until you're picking up the pieces
You never think it's going to break
I'm not gonna leave you like this
Won't sweep it all away
We can put it back together make it better than we had it before
And I know I can make you see what I can see you don't believe anymore
You might also likeCause nothing's changed in us
But I can feel you slipping away
Like the sunlight at the end of the day
I can feel you slipping away
Like the sunlight at the end of the day
Hey, hold on brother
Wait, it's not over
Whatever comes between us I know we can make it right in the end
The river keeps running but were gonna find each other again
So hold on
So hold on
So hold on brother
So hold on
Cause I can feel you slipping away
Like the sunlight at the end of the day
I can feel you slipping away
Like the sunlight at the end of the day
So the river's trying to pull me away
But I'm holding on whatever it takes
And I'll never let you slip away away away
Hey, hold on brother
Wait, it's not over
Whatever comes between us I know we can make it right in the end
And the river keeps running but were gonna find each other again
So hold on
So hold on
