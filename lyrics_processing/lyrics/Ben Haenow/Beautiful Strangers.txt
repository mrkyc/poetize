Baby, you look so good to me
Tell me where you came here from
It's crazy, I really do believe
You could be the only one
Save me, oh come and dance with me
Instead of dancing on your own
The music's playing, I don't want you to leave
Stay with me for one more song, oh

Hey girl, I know I've never seen you before
But from the moment that you walked in, I knew
I know I've never wanted anything more
I'll do whatever it takes to be with you

I know that we've only got tonight (stay with, stay with me tonight)
And I just want your body close to mine (stay with me tonight)

Baby, I wanna get with you
Tell me how to make you mine
And lately, I could use someone like you
We've been waiting all this time
And I'm not playing, wanna say just what I mean
Baby, we don't have too long
The music's playing and I don't want you to leave
Stay with me for one more song, yeah

I know that we've only got tonight (stay with, stay with me tonight)
And I just want your body close to mine (stay with me tonight)
Oh, beautiful stranger (stay with me)
You're running out of time (stay with me tonight)
And I just want your body close to mine
Stay with me tonight

Oh, beautiful stranger
Stay with me tonight
Beautiful stranger
I want you by my side, yeah

I know that we've only got tonight (stay with, stay with me tonight)
And I just want your body close to mine (stay with me tonight)
Oh, beautiful stranger (stay with me)

Beautiful stranger (me tonight)
Stay with me tonight (me tonight)
