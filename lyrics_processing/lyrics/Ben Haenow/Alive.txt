How could I ever have doubted
With all that you show, and all that you say
I should've never allowed it
Letting it all just get in my way

This life gets tough
We're bruised and cut
But we can mend ourselves
And with your love
You light me up

Yeah lately I've been thinking about it
All that you do and all that you've done
Don't know how I've been living without it
You give me the strength to stand tall when I wanna run

This life gets tough
We're bruised and cut
But we can mend ourselves
And with your love
You light me up
No one can stop this burning

Let's take the fire we started
And set this place alight
We're coming out of the darkness
And taking back the night
And I, I never felt so alive
And I, I never felt so alive

This light that you're shining around me
It's showing me sights that I've never seen
And I can never do it without you
I tried to tell you
But you'll never really know what you mean to me, yeah

This life gets tough
We're bruised and cut
But we can mend ourselves
And with your love
You light me up
No one can stop this burning

Let's take the fire we started
And set this place alight
We're coming out of the darkness
And taking back the night
And I, I never felt so alive
And I, I never felt so alive
And with your love
You light me up
No one can stop this burning
Yeah, with your love
You light me up
No one can stop this burning

Let's take the fire we started
And set this place alight
We're coming out of the darkness
And taking back the night
And I, I never felt so alive
