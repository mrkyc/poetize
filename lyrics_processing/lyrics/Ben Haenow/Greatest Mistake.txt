Tell me baby, where'd you go
You always said that I could do what I want
But all I want to do it's just hold you, oh oh
I just wanna love you, oh oh
Yeah, like I'm supposed to, oh oh
But all my friends say I should run away as fast as I can go
Your poison touch, she's all I got on my brain
I'm so messed up, why don't you hit me again
You're poison love
It's my greatest mistake, yeah

Why I fall for someone so bad for me
But in my defense, yeah
I kind of like when you're mad at me
And all I do is hold you, oh oh
I just wanna love you, oh oh
Yeah, like I'm supposed to, oh oh
But all my friends say I should run away as fast as I can go
