And visible when you look into a clear blue sky
Memories of days gone by
Activated by a mirror ball shining bright
In a provincial disco on a Thursday night
You appeared from nowhere beside me on the floor
Identical in every detail to the way you were before
The best part of a decade since you went out of my life
The worst part of a decade, but here you are tonight
By my side
You're in my eyes, you're in my face
Just like before you went away
You're in my arms, I feel your warmth
And I will dance until the dawn
'Cause I don't want to lose you again, oh no
Yeah, I don't want to lose you again, oh no
A trick of the light, a disco hallucination
A waking dream, an impossible situation
Oh, but you look real good in your halter-top, don't stop
Don't disappear
I need you here
I need you here
You're in my eyes, you're in my face
Just like before you went away
You're in my arms, I feel your warmth
And I will dance until the dawn
'Cause I don't want to lose you again, oh no
No, I don't want to lose you again, oh no
And I don't want this song to ever end, 'cause I know if it did then you would disappear again. Let this be forever 3 AM. Caught in a loop that repeats endlessly. It was the mirror ball that did it - a chance reflection that sparked you back to life. Like you'd just been to the bar for a little while, and you smiled and there was nothing in your eyes, like this silt in mine making it hard to get around. I thought you'd gone, but all this time I'd been carrying you around in my eyes
In my eyes
In my eyes
You're in my eyes, you're in my face
Just like before you went away
You're in my arms, I feel your warmth
And I will dance until the dawn
'Cause I don't want to lose you again, oh no
Yeah, I don't want to lose you again, oh no
Yeah, I don't want to lose you again, oh no
Because one day my eyes will be full. A snow storm every time I shake my head. But that day is not tonight. And if we keep moving - dancing tight - they might never catch us
