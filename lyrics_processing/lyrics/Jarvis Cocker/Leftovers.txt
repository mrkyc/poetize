And I make no bones about it
I said if you wish to study dinosaurs
I know a specimen whose interest is undoubted
Trapped in a body that is failing me
Well, please allow me to be succinct
I wanna love you whilst we both still have flesh upon our bones
Before we both become extinct
That's what I told her: I wanna be your lover
And then I told her twice: I wanna be your lover
Well, he says that he loves you like a sister
Well I guess, I guess that's relative
He says that he wants to make love to you
Well instead of "to", shouldn't that be "with"?
Oh, I told you once: I wanna be your lover
And now I've told you twice: I wanna be your lover
And so I come to you filled with guilt and self-loathing
And I am praying that you could make me good
And so I fall upon your neck just like a vampire
Yeah, like a vampire who faints at the sight of blood
You might also likeAnd I told you once: I wanna be your lover
I'm gonna say it again
And then I told you twice: I wanna be your lover
Well this is my CV and I've got no one else to blame
So I will state, state my case, I will state it again
Come and help yourself to leftovers
Got a little surplus love and affection
And getting cuddly, so won't you cuddle me?
I could be your teddy bear... oh yeah
I know I ain't no eligible bachelor
This is no mouthwatering proposition
Make no mistake, you're in big trouble, little lady
If we start a-hugging and a-kissing
And a-kissing, are you listening?
'Cause I told you once
And then I told you twice
And now I told you three times
And at the risk of repeating myself
I'm gonna say it again
Yeah
I wanna be your lover
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I wanna be your lover
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I wanna be your lover
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I wanna be your lover
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
