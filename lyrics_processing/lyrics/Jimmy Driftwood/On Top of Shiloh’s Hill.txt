Come all you gallant soldiers, a story I will tell
About the bloody battle on top of Shiloh's Hill
It was an awful struggle that would cause your heart to chill
All from the bloody battle on top of Shiloh's Hill (on top of Shiloh's Hill, on top of Shiloh's Hill)

'Twas on the sixth of April, about the break of day
The drums and fifes were playing for us to march away
My feelings at that moment, I do remember still
When first my feet were tromping on top of Shiloh's Hill (on top of Shiloh's Hill, on top of Shiloh's Hill)

About the hour of sunrise, the battle first began
Before the fight was over, we fought them hand to hand
The horrors of the battle did my soul with anguish fill
The wounded and the dying on top of Shiloh's Hill (on top of Shiloh's Hill, on top of Shiloh's Hill)

Early up on the next morning we fit the fight again
Unmindful of the wounded, unuseful to the slain
The cannon smoke did hide the sun, ten thousand was the killed
And streams of blood went running on top of Shiloh's Hill (on top of Shiloh's Hill, on top of Shiloh's Hill)

My uniform of blue was turned into a purplish red
When someone on a foeman's steed did strike me on the head
I sent a bullet through his heart and as he fell away
I saw the face of my dear father dressed in bloody gray (on top of Shiloh's Hill)

We won the battle, but my heart will always be in pain (yeah, yeah, yeah)
The one who brought me to this world, I'll never see again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I pray to Christ my savior, consistent with His will
