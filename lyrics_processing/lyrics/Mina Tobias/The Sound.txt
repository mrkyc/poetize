Tell me romance for nothing, you don't know for sure
And I'm gonna fight for something, something more
Tell me i'm standing for nothing, or maybe with a cure
And nobody has been asking, asking for

Tell me i'm just the one, who never matter more
Cause I'm gonna fight for something, something
Tell me i'm standing for nothing, or maybe with a cure
And nobody has been asking, asking for

No-no-no-no-no-no-no
I'll never let you down
Oh-oh, even when I were a crown
Even when I'm doing alright
Oh, i won't just skip the sound
No-no-no-no-no-no-no
I'll never let you down
Oh-oh, even when I were a crown
Even when I'm doing alright
Oh, i won't just skip the sound
