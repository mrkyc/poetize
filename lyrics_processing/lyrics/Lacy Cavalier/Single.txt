Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Things didn't end great
I cried a lot and you drank
I've been takin' my time
But you took no time to get back to your game
You do a real good job
Pretendin' to be okay
It kinda almost seems like
You gon' really love her one day

You didn't stay single long
Just found somebody else to put your issues on
Don't even know how to be alone, ooh
You didn't stay single long
But that don't mean I believe you've moved on
Yeah, we both know you ain't letting go, ooh

You didn't stay single for long
Single for long, single for...
You might also like
Yeah, she's kinda cute
I'll give that to you, babe
But how good could it be when you're hittin' me
On weeknights, sayin' shady things
A relationship's s'posed to be
A two people only thing
But you're tryna make it three
'Cause you ain't even close to over me

You didn't stay single long
Just found somebody else to put your issues on
Don't even know how to be alone, ooh
You didn't stay single long
But that don't mean I believe you've moved on
Yeah, we both know you ain't letting go, ooh

You didn't stay single for long
Single for long, single for...
You didn't stay single for long
Single for long

You're just a sad boy
She's just a sad chick
Gettin' hit with collateral damage
From the mess she never dealt with
You're just a sad boy
She's just a sad chick
Gettin' hit with collateral damage
From the mess she never dealt with
You didn't stay single long
Just found somebody else to put your issues on
Don't even know how to be alone, ooh
You didn't stay single long
But that don't mean I believe you've moved on
Yeah, we both know you ain't letting go, ooh

You didn't stay single for long
Single for long, single for...
You didn't stay single for long
