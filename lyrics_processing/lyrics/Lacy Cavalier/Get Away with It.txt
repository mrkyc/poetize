Watchin' you watch me take down my hair
Slow motion falling, feeling your stare
I wish your hands were where your eyes are at
Tracing my shoulders all the way down my back
You're like a different language I want to speak
Like a handsome stranger I want to meet
You make me want to know all the unknown
Paintin' up trouble like gold

You get away
With making me want
To forever stay here in your space everyday
You get away with it
You get away
With making me fawn, making me trip
'Gain and again, everyday
You get away with it

Keep the red pourin' 'cause I know we're done
I'm all here for it, this buzz has just begun
You slid right under that yellow caution tape
And I never questioned a thing
You might also like
You get away
With making me want
To forever stay here in your space everyday
You get away with it
You get away
With making me fawn, making me trip
'Gain and again, everyday
You get away with it

You're makin' me trip
Makin' me want to stay forever
Everyday baby
Again and again, and again, and again, and again, everyday
Again and again, and again, and again, and again, everyday
Don't just leave, now

You get away (You get away)
With making me want
To forever stay here in your space everyday
You get away with it
You get away
With making me fawn, making me trip
'Gain and again, everyday (Every single damn day)
You get away with it
You get away
With making me want
To forever stay here in your space everyday
(Here in your space, baby)
You get away with it
You get away
With making me fawn, making me trip
'Gain and again, everyday
You get away
