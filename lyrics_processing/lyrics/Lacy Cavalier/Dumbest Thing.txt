Mmm-mmm-mmm, ah

There's not one good reason why
I called you last night
But I had a talk with some 42
And the fourth glass told me to
I was surprised you picked up
I might have said too much
Bringin' up some old feelings
And how I've been wonderin'

Just a couple little things
Like if you still feel the same
Like you did way back when
When
I had a couple little drinks
And started sayin' crazy things
Like maybe we could jump back in
But to think that we could be us again
Was the dumbest thing I ever did

I guess I got drunk again (Guess I got drunk again)
Forgive me for callin'
Yeah, to think that we could be us again
Was the dumbest thing I ever did

My birthday wasn't the same
The whole crew's there, mom and dad came
It was the first time in three years
You weren't sittin' beside me there
Nostalgia got the best of me
I kept playin' out how it could be
If I forgave you, but forgive me
It was the dumbest thing for wondering

Just a couple little things
Like if you still feel the same
Like you did way back when
When
I had a couple little drinks
And started sayin' crazy things
Like maybe we could jump back in
But to think that we could be us again
Was the dumbest thing I ever did

Like showin' up at your house
And thinkin' if I scream loud
Maybe we'd work it out
It was the dumbest thing
Like pretendin' that I was strong
And swearin' that we were wrong
And lettin' you move on
It was the dumbest thing
(The dumbest thing)
It was the dumbest thing (The dumbest thing)
The dumbest thing
It was the dumbest thing I ever did
The dumbest thing (The dumbest thing)
The dumbest thing (The dumbest thing)
The dumbest thing
It was the dumbest thing I ever did
I guess I got drunk again
Forgive me for callin'
Yeah, to think that we could be us again
