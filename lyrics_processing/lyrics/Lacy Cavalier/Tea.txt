Pretty little dress
Sitting on shoulders you keep held back
Pearls on your neck
Your mama's mama used to have
Country club wave and that cushion cut
Next to that pink-painted pinky that you got holdin' up

I know something you don't wanna know
Your man should tell you, but he won't
We all know somethin' you don't wanna know, no

Let me serve you some tea (Yeah)
I know the truth can be a little hard to drink
I know he's smooth, but he ain't what you think
You don't know me, but I know him to a T
He's got you sippin'
Let me serve you some tea (Yeah)
I know the truth can be a little hard to drink
He's doin' to you what he did to me
You don't know me, but I know him to a T
He's got you sippin' on that fake love, honey

Easy on the eyes
He could sell the moon every time he speaks
GQ smile and a wallet that could buy you anything
I can tell you right now, he ain't gonna mean them vows
Save the white dress for a man with an honest mouth

Let me serve you some tea (Yeah)
I know the truth can be a little hard to drink
I know he's smooth, but he ain't what you think
You don't know me, but I know him to a T
He's got you sippin'
Let me serve you some tea (Yeah)
I know the truth can be a little hard to drink
He's doin' to you what he did to me
You don't know me, but I know him to a T
He's got you sippin' on that fake love, honey

The cup got heavy, girl don't blame me
I'd wanna know if it were me
The cup got heavy, girl don't blame me
'Cause he don't wanna spill the tea

Let me serve you some tea
I know the truth can be a little hard to drink
I know he's smooth, but he ain't what you think
You don't know me, but I know him to a T
He's got you sippin'
Let me serve you some tea (Yeah)
I know the truth can be a little hard to drink
He's doin' to you what he did to me
You don't know me, but I know him to a T
He's got you sippin' on that fake love, honey
The cup got heavy, girl don't blame me
I'd wanna know if it were me
The cup got heavy, girl don't blame me
