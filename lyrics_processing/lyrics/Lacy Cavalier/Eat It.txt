You're always asking what I want
Want to give me the world and then some
We're both living life unconventionally
That makes you exciting to me
But if you hold me down, I'ma wanna leave
Just 'cause I'm in no place to jump in something exclusive, baby
Don't mean I don't dream 'bout how those goddamn hands...
I wanna have my freedom, freedom and still have you
I wanna have my cake and eat it, eat it too
Wanna have it both ways, baby, don't make me choose
I wanna have my cake and eat it, eat it too
I really only love the beginning phases
You play a little house, little cat and mouse
Get naked and figure each other out
But when that part comes to an end, I wanna start over again
So I keep one foot in and one out
Why can't that be enough right now?
Just 'cause I'm in no place to jump in something exclusive, baby
Don't mean I don't dream 'bout how those goddamn hands...
I wanna have my freedom, freedom and still have you
I wanna have my cake and eat it, eat it too
Wanna have it both ways, baby, don't make me choose
I wanna have my cake and eat it, eat it too
You might also likeI'm not ready to have to have all the answers
Tell me, does that bother you?
I'm not ready to have to have all the pressure
I'm an Aries through and through
Let's just keep this light, come and spend the night
Let's not leave this room
Not ready to have to have it together
I just wanna be young with you
I wanna have my freedom, freedom and still have you
I wanna have my cake and eat it, eat it too
Wanna have it both ways, baby, don't make me choose
