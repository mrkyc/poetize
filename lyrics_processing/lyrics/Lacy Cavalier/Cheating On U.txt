Cheating on you
You

You told me people could only fall in love once
Then you told me you loved me after two months
So I just assumed I was the one
Jealousy was never something I believed in
'Til you let random girls in the bed I sleep in
And I still wonder why I didn't leave then

It'll be three years and three days since
I met you at the Opry backstage
Leanin' against that doorway
Sometimes I wish I would've shown up late

I wish I didn't feel like you're the one
Still, it don't really feel like this is done
When I'm out here on dates tryna find new love
Find new love
Yeah, it's been a month or two
Since we said that we were through
So why does it feel like I'm cheating on you?

Cheating on you, you

Ain't moved on in case things change at all
I still talk to your cousin and your sister in-law
I know they're probably wonder what's goin' on
On the days that I really wanna forgive you
I think about all the other girls touching you
And honestly it's left me with some body issues

Now I'm blank starin' at some new face
Can't help but compare everything
I'm sure you're at some chick's place
Doin' what you do with no shame

I wish I didn't feel like you're the one
Still, it don't really feel like this is done
When I'm out here on dates tryna find new love
Find new love
Yeah, it's been a month or two
Since we said that we were through
So why does it feel like I'm cheating on you?
Cheating on you, you
Cheating on you, you

Thing is, when I look back
You always needed control and now I see that
You just want to make me feel bad
And it's kinda working, ain't that sad?

I wish I didn't feel like you're the one
Still, it don't really feel like this is done
When I'm out here on dates tryna find new love
Find new love
Yeah, it's been a month or two
Since we said that we were through
So why does it feel like I'm cheating on you?

Cheating on you, you
