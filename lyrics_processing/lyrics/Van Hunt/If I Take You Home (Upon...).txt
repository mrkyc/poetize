If you're going my way
Let's take the fast lane to your place... together...
Somethin's come over me:
I stink of teenage heat;
Lay me down before I freeze... forever...
Girls: (If I take you home, will you respect me in the mornin'?)
"Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah..." 
Girls: (If I take you home, will you write my name in a song?)
"Yeah, yeah..." 
I want you 'cause I need to;
Never felt so sure about a cure upon meeting someone new...
Watch me, baby!
Watch me!
We're going nowhere;
Can't wait to get back there
So, I can pull your hair... forever...
(I know it feels good...) You know it feels good
(Just the way pain should...) Just the way pain should;
(The young and dirty laugh through...) The young and dirty laugh through it... together...
Girls: (If I take you home, will you respect me in the mornin'?)
"Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah..." 
Girls: (If I take you home, will you write my name in a song?)
"Yeah, yeah..."

(Yeah, yeah...)
Indication of a strained relation has my devotion spent...
(Yeah, yeah...)
I know what it looks like, but the time is right;
Never felt so sure about a cure for the quiet life...
I want you 'cause I need to;
Never felt so sure about a cure upon meeting someone new...
