(Highway killed the village)
(Highway killed fashion, killed fashion)
Ooh, (I was raised) I was raised (by the milliner) by the milliner
(Ultrasuede) Ultrasuede
(by a home stay) by a home stay (we should all become old hats)

Lost among the noise of muscular toys
Of all the old stories
About old fashion, old fashion
I'm told that black crows made mobile homes in
A blue sky that blew slow when
Uptown was still low then
Now it's is all traffic, it's all traffic
It's all fast

(Highway) Highway (killed the village)
(Highway) Highway (killed fashion) killed fashion, (killed fashion)
Ooh, (I was raised) I was raised (by the milliner) by the milliner
(Ultrasuede) Ultrasuede)
(by a home stay) home stay (we should all become) we should all become (old hats)
Just gimme some love, just gimme some (x5)

He died without an heir
To the castle, to the castle
To the throne
Think you're the greatest
Just cause you're latest
Well we all go, baby, to the rapture, to the rapture
With the ghost

(Highway) Highway (killed the village) killed the village
(Highway killed fashion), killed fashion (killed fashion)
Ooh, (I was raised) I was raised, yeah (by the milliner) by the milliner
(Ultrasuede) Ultrasuede
By a home stay (home stay) we should all become
Just gimme some love, just gimme some (x7)

Rose passion from my clothes
Like this coat
The way it moves on me, don't you know it
Them last two jokers
They're the ones they're laughing, they're laughing
At the most
(Highways) Highways (killed the village) killed the village
(Highway killed fashion), killed fashion (killed fashion)
Ooh, (I was raised) I was raised (by the milliner) by the motherfucking milliner
(Ultrasuede) oh
(By a home stay we should all become old hats)
