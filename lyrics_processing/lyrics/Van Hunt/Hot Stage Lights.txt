All the men in her life, they been hung up, poster-ized
Like dead heroes;
She done traveled the globe, leaving their hearts pulverized
From coast to coast...
Invited me over for tea, looking hot and murderous
From head to toe;
I took a seat right by the door, with my hand on my gun
Determined to keep my clothes on...
She kiss me on my neck, and I feel the fire;
...Feel those cameras flashin'... feel them hot stage lights...
I've been voted best, #1 desire;
...the latest passion... Oh!
It's clear, I'm man of the year
But I won't go near them hot stage lights...
It's clear, I'm man of the year
But I won't go near them hot stage lights...
She can shoot out my windows, but, I'm already gone
Cursed and criminal;
And, she won't waste her breath - she'll send me a text on the phone
With her thoughts in prose...
I don't love her as much as I glamorize her
Like a centerfold;
I don't want her as much as I want to own her
And, then let her go...

But I won't go near them hot stage lights...
It's clear, I'm man of the year
But I won't go near them hot stage lights...
(I'm cool.)
Today I, your love, tomorrow, the world;
Wish that I could stay, but I'm looking for more...
Maybe one day, at the end of the tour
I'll drop by - if still I'm ready for the hot stage lights...
Ready for the hot stage lights...
If I'm ready for the hot stage lights...
If I'm ready for the hot stage lights...
Today, your love - tomorrow, the world;
Wish that I could stay, but I want more...
Maybe one day, at the end of the tour
I'll drop by if then I'm ready for the hot stage lights...
