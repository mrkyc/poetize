I don't need to fit in
Stand up if you give a damn
It's the living season
Who and what you're looking for
Have you got a reason
You can if you want to see
Touch I'm on only human
The same blood
The same cells
The same God
The same hell
The same life
The same love
Somebody, anybody
Everybody stand up
Hey you!
We can turn it up
Hey you!
We can turn it up
You know no one's listening
They don't want to it
Saying what you want to say
People start to fear it
