Are we on? Are we off?
On the phone, reality
Every word is killing me
You dirty bitch, beautiful
Treatin' me like an animal
Changing rules, I never knew
Let me get over you

Girl got a gun, girl got a gun. Bang! Bang!
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun, gun, gun
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun. Bang! Bang!
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun, gun, gun
Girl got a gun, girl got a. Bang! Bang! Bang!
(Bang! Bang!...)
Got my heart, I got the night
All my love, left behind
Take a trip, roll the dice
I got lost, paradise
