What's underneath the moon and stars?
What's underneath our clothes, we are
Hiding what we want to share
Take my hand, I'll take you there

There's a call in the wild
There's a snake in your bed
And it's telling you something (it says)
Yeah I like it like that!
When you're feeling lonely
Go help yourself
Do whatever you desire

Go throw your arrows
Hit her heart
If they don't react
Love who loves you back!
The perfect storm
What turns you on?
You can have all that
Love who loves you back!
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Love who loves you back!
Turn me on, turn me on
Love who loves you back!
Turn me on, turn me on
Love who loves you back!

What's real we have to squint to see
Lean in closer next to me
Count to three and lose control
If you like it let me know

Some are small, some are tall
Some are born with it all
Some are in it for the kill
Some just do it for the thrill
Archers aim your perfect mark and throw

Throw your arrows
Hit her heart
If they don't react
Love who loves you back!
