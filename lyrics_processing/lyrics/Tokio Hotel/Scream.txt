You get up and somebody tells you where to go to
When you get there, everybody's telling you what to do
Thank you, it's been another bloody Monday
And no one is asking what you wanted anyway

Nein - nein - nein - nananana nein
Nein - nein - nein - nananana nein
Scream 'til you feel it
Scream 'til you believe it
Scream and when it hurts you
Scream it out loud
Scream 'til you feel it
Scream 'til you believe it
Scream and when it hurts you
Scream it out loud
Scream (Scream it out loud)

Watch out stay awake they're lurking
Obsess you they are always working
Promising everything you never asked for
And one day it'll be too late and you'll beg for more

Scream and when it hurts you
Scream it out loud

Back to zero
Your time's about to come
Let them know
You're not just anyone
(Scream scream scream it out loud
Scream scream scream it out loud)

Your time's about to come

Scream 'til you feel it
Scream 'til you believe it
Scream and when it hurts you
Scream it out loud
Scream 'til you feel it

Scream it out loud, (shout)

No cause you feel it
No cause you believe it
No and when it hurts you
Scream it out loud
No! No! No! No! No! No!
