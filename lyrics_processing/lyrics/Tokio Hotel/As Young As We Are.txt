Love is all we got
Love is all we got, and we want it all
Love is all we got

My face is numb, I like this place
Break my heart, cut and paste
I try to drown all my fears in downtown
Are you down, are you with me?
I wanna fly, play my cards, learn the rules
Pay my dues, my world is spinnin'

I've been on earth so many times
I've seen it all, I'm alright
You tell me things I wanna hear
So let us die

As young as we are
As young as we are
As young as we a-a
As young as we are
As young as we are
As young as we are
As young as we a-a
As young as we are

Ooh-ooh
I want it, you want it, we want it
As young as we are

I'm living fast, I'm on my own
It's gonna hurt falling into you
I close my eyes, I let go of control
Cut a line, I'm in trouble
The end is near, I don't fear
Something new, something real
Pop my bubble

I've been on earth so many times
I've seen it all, I'm alright
I tell you things you wanna hear
So let us die

As young as we are
As young as we are
As young as we a-a
As young as we are
As young as we are
As young as we are
As young as we a-a
As young as we are
Goodbye
Ooh-ooh
I want it, you want it, we want it
As young as we are

Love is all we got
Love is all we got, and we want it all
Love is all we got
Love is all we got, and we want it all
Love is all we got, and we want it all

As young as we are
As young as we are
As young as we a-a
As young as we are
As young as we are
As young as we are
As young as we a-a
As young as we are

Goodbye
Ooh-ooh
I want it, you want it, we want it
As young as we are
Love is all we got, and we want it all
