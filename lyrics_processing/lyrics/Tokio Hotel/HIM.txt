He stares
Squintin' through the sunlight
There's a tear in the sky and it bleeds red and it burns bright
All night
I ride the wave along that takes me
Right through the door of my sanity

I feel the rush, rush
Without your touch, touch
Washin' over me
I feel so much, much
Without your touch, touch
There's something wrong with me

He's an unknown, yeah, and he don't care
Whenever I want him, he'll be right here
Just how I like him
Just how I like him
I scream when I'm mad, but you don't talk back
I know you're not real, but I'm good with that
Just how I like him
Just how I like him

I close my eyes, but I never sleep
I think you live in my head
Counting the stars watchin' over me

I feel the rush, rush
Without your touch, touch
Washin' over me
I feel so much, much
Without your touch, touch
There's something wrong with me

He's an unknown, yeah, and he don't care
Whenever I want him, he'll be right here
Just how I like him
Just how I like him
I scream when I'm mad, but you don't talk back
I know you're not real, but I'm good with that
Just how I like him
Just how I like him

He stares
Squintin' through the sunlight
There's a tear in the sky and it bleeds red and it burns bright
He's an unknown, yeah, and he don't care
Whenever I want him, he'll be right here
Just how I like him
Just how I like him
