(Every night, baby, every day)
(I feel your heart beating so close to me)

Nothing to say, nowhere to be
Lost in a daze and TV's on repeat
Nothing to do, looking at you
All through the weekend

Gonna let the curtains closed
Can you make it feel like home?
And darling, if you're loosing hope
I just wanna let you know

Baby, no, I don't wanna talk, wanna talk
Tell me nothing 'cause I can feel the rush
When you wrap your arms around me
And just a little touch, little touch
Feel your body, can you feel the rush?
Let's forget the world around us tonight
(Hey)

Summertime heat under the sheets
All of your loving is all that I need
Deep in your eyes, a sadness inside
Not trying to fix you

Can you make it feel like home?
And darling, if you're loosing hope
I just wanna let you know

Baby, no, I don't wanna talk, wanna talk
Tell me nothing 'cause I can feel the rush
When you wrap your arms around me
And just a little touch, little touch
Feel your body, can you feel the rush?
Let's forget the world around us tonight
And all through the weekend
Let's forget the world around us tonight
And all through the weekend
Let's forget the world around us tonight

Every night, baby, every day
I feel your heart beating so close to me
Every night, baby, every day
I feel your heart beating so close to me
Tonight

Baby, no, I don't wanna talk, wanna talk
Tell me nothing 'cause I can feel the rush
When you wrap your arms around me
And just a little touch, little touch
Feel your body, can you feel the rush?
Let's forget the world around us tonight
And all through the weekend
Let's forget the world around us tonight
And all through the weekend
