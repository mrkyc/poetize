It's been a while since i've seen your face
I wonder how you look today, old friend
Remember when you knew my name
Before the world got in our way?
I won't forget

But I wanna be connected
The way we were before
You said we'd stay the same
That we wouldn't change at all
Our hearts were unprotected
We were never scared to fall
You said you won't forget me
Guess time has changed in all

When life was easy
And we smoked weed in the backseat of your car
And watched the stars
When love came easy
I gave you all a boy could give
Life was wild and dangerous
But I know

We can't go-o-o-o
Go-o-o
We can't go back now
Go-o-o-o
Go-o-o
We can't go back now

We had nothing figured out
No regrets, no doubts, we had it all
I miss the times we didn't care
I miss it when you were here
What did we do?

I wanna be connected
The way we were before
You said we'd stay the same
That we wouldn't change at all
Our hearts were unprotected
We were never scared to fall
You said you won't forget me
Guess time has changed in all

When life was easy
And we smoked weed in the backseat of your car
And watched the stars
When love came easy
I gave you all a boy could give
Life was wild and dangerous
But I know
We can't go-o-o-o
O-o-o-o
We can't go back now
Go-o-o-o
Go-o-o
We can't go back now

When life was easy
And we smoked weed in the backseat of your car
And watched the stars
When love came easy
I gave you all a boy could give
Life was wild and dangerous
But I know we can't-

Oooh
