Come pick me up in your car
Don't let me down for nothing
I wanna know who you are
And if you down for something
I want a piece of your heart
Come let's just not do anything
Give me a piece of the stars
We're high as fuck, nowhere to be
No second chance in this galaxy
It could be you, it could be me
So let us be, you and I
What if I would love you till the end?
You would never be alone again
What if I would love you till the end?
(What if, what if, what if)
You would never be alone again
(What if, what if, baby)
It's 5 a.m., that's nothing
Get you back in the car
We're getting lost in some new place
At least we know who we are

No second chance in this galaxy
It could be you, it could be me
So let us be, you and I
What if I would love you till the end?
You would never be alone again
What if I would love you till the end?
You would never be alone again
What if I would love you till the end?
(What if, what if, what if)
You would never be alone again
(What if, what if, baby)
What if I would love you till the end?
(What if, what if, what if)
You would never be alone again
(What if, what if, baby)
What if
Feel I will show again
What if I would love you till the end?
You would never be alone again
What if I would love you till the end?
You would never be alone again
What if I would love you till the end?
(What if, what if, what if)
You would never be alone again
(What if, what if, baby)
What if I would love you till the end?
(What if, what if, what if)
You would never be alone again
