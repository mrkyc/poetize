Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Stupid me, I don't know how to slow down
Felt your touch and now I want it all now (oh)
Waiting by the phone begging for a call now
Centuries go by, and still there's no sound

Why do you play with my heart, why do do do you?
(Do do do you, do do do you)
When you know that I see right through through through you?
(oh)

But if you don't love me the way I love you
And if you don't want me the way I want you
And if you don't need me the way I need you (oh)
I just got one thing to say to you
Stupid you

Stupid you, you don't know how to act right
Gave you the best sleep you ever had in your life (oh)
And all you had to do was kiss me goodnight
I swear to you a man like me you won't find (oh)
You might also like
Why do you play with my heart, why do do do you?
(Do do do you, do do do you)
When you know that I see right through through through you?
(oh)

But if you don't love me the way I love you
And if you don't want me the way I want you
And if you don't need me the way I need you (oh)
I just got one thing to say to you
Stupid you

Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

So why do you play with my heart, why do do do you?
(Do do do you, do do do you)
When you know that I see right through through through you?
(oh)

But if you don't love me the way I love you
And if you don't want me the way I want you
And if you don't need me the way I need you (oh)
I just got one thing to say to you
Stupid you, aye
Stupid you, oh oh oh
Stupid me for falling for you
