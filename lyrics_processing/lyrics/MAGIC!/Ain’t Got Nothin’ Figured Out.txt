I don't know what is real or fake
All these numbers don't calculate
Trying but I can't calibrate purpose
Looking for my own destiny
Without sense or sanity
Tryin' not to get stuck on the surface

One day she loves me
The next she cries
I can read the stars
But not the look in her eyes
Thought I had the answers
The key to life
But the more I search
It seems the less I find

'Cause the only thing that I got figured out
Is that I ain't got nothing figured out
The only thing that I got figured out
Is that I ain't got nothing figured out
(Yeah) So, so, so I ain't gonna stress it up
I'm just gonna let life do, what it do
'Cause the only thing that I got figured out
Is that I ain't got nothing figured out
You might also like
I don't know if I'm off or on
Do I stand out or I just belong
Tell me is there something that I'm missin'
It's getting harder to meditate
Faking all of my namastes
Trying to get back what I've been given

One day she loves me
The next she cries
I can read the stars
But not the look in her eyes
Thought I had the answers
The key to life
But the more I search
The less I find

'Cause the only thing that I got figured out
Is that I ain't got nothing figured out
The only thing that I got figured out
Is that I ain't got nothing figured out
(Yeah) So, so, so I ain't gonna stress it up
I'm just gonna let life do, what it do
'Cause the only thing that I got figured out
Is that I ain't got nothing figured out
(Guitar Solo)
'Cause the only thing that I got figured out
Is that I ain't got nothing figured out (Ay, say)
The only thing that I got figured out
Is that I ain't got nothing figured out (Absolutely nothin')
'Cause the only thing that I got figured out
Is that I ain't got nothing figured out
The only thing that I got figured out
Is that I ain't got nothing figured out

(Yeah) So, so, so I ain't gonna stress it up
I'm just gonna let life do, what it do
'Cause the only thing that I got figured out
Is that I ain't got nothing figured out
