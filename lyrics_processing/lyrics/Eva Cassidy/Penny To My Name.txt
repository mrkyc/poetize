Bill and I got married
Following our first born
Daddy left this gas and convenience store
Just before he died
And I was only nineteen
When I had my third baby
Sometimes I think maybe
I should have left here long ago

Travelers are stopping by
Check their oil and their PSI
Gas up and away they fly
Moving down the line
But this beat up truck and worn out shoes
Always giving me the blues
Billy's sucking down the booze
Nearly every night

I've never seen the city lights
How they must shine so bright
Not like this country night
The sky's black as coal
And this gas station mountain home
Not a thing to call my own
How I wish I was alone
With a penny to my name
You might also like
Strangers say this mountain here
Is beautiful beyond compare
But it's just a dumb old mountain there
I see it every day
If I could see sunset skies
Over fields of grain, or ocean tides
City skyline in the night
I'll be dancing 'til the dawn

I've never seen the city lights
How they must shine so bright
Not like this country night
The sky's black as coal
And this gas station mountain home
Not a thing to call my own
How I wish I was alone
With a penny to my name

Bill and I got married
Following our first born
Daddy left this gas and convenience store
Just before he died
Maybe Bill and I someday
Will find a chance to get away
Until then it's here I'll stay
Wishing on a star
I've never seen the city lights
How they must shine so bright
Not like this country night
The sky's black as coal
And this gas station mountain home
Not a thing to call my own
How I wish I was alone
