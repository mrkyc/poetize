Ohhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhh yeah yeah
Can you pretend to be the man
I should have been with
Can we make the life?
You know I should have had
Can we do a better job of pretending that you really care
Or ill have to give the part to someone else
You seem to have an important part
The leading role of my heart
You played it well
A long time ago
Until I started falling in love
And then you changed you character
And avoided all of your lines
Now the man I love is gone now
Can you plays is part or just try
Can you pretend to be the man
I should have been with
Can you make the life
You know I should have had
Can you do a better job of pretending that you really care
Or ill have to give the part to someone else
You might also likeLove is like a see saw
It takes two in order for it to work
I working hard
Im playing my part
But the scean still won't work
And rehearsals are long
Because your timing is all wrong
So ill find someone who loves me
And can play your part for life
I deserve alot better than this
And im tired of acting like
Its okay for me to give you my love
And recieve nothing back in return
Can you pretend to be the man
I should have been with
Can you make the life?
You know I should have had
Can you do a better job of pretending that you really care?
Or ill have to give the part to someone else
Can you pretend to be the man?
I should have been with
Can you make the life?
You know I should have had
Can you do a better job of pretending that you really care?
Or ill have to give the part to someone else
