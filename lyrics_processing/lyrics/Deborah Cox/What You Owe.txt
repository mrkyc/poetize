Oh, ooh-ooh
Mmm
Woo, ooh-ooh
Ah-ah, huh
Yeah

Swipe me off my feet to only
To drop me, babe
You just let me keep falling
Didn't stop me baby
So blinded by love I was trippin'
Couldn't never hit the mark
We kept missin'

Took my breath away, then suffocate me
So, I can't breathe
Don't make promises that you can't keep
Put back the pieces you broke
Give back the time that you stole
You said you'd never let go
Can't help but feel like you owe me

You know that you owe me
You know that you owe me
Took away the old me
You owe me, you owe me
My days, you owe me back
Lost nights, you owe me that
I know I'll never get 'em back
But some day you'll pay what you owe
You might also like
Honestly you never loved me
Did you babe?
This new side of you is ugly
I see it, baby
Well I got questions that need answers
Why couldn't you just have been better?

You blew me away, then left me stranded and shattered
You sold me a vision of forever
Put back the pieces you broke
Give back the time that you stole
You said you'd never let go
Can't help but feel like you owe me

You know that you owe me
You know that you owe me
Took away the old me
You owe me, you owe me
My days, you owe me back
Lost nights, you owe me that
I know I'll never get 'em back
But some day you'll pay what you owe
Puttin' back the pieces myself
You can leave
Don't need nothin' else
You're gonna pay what you owe

You know that you owe me
You know that you owe me
Took away the old me
You owe me, you owe me
My days, you owe me back
Lost nights, you owe me that
I know I'll never get 'em back
But some day you'll pay what you owe
