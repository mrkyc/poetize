Mmm
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Hey, ooh
(That's the only time I get sentimental)

I used to mess around
But I never let it get into me
'Cause I didn't take you serious, baby
Now to be without your love
Only makes me realize
What I could've had in you, honey

Now that you're gone, I want you more
I said it slapped me in my face
And then my friends don't understand
Because I had the chance
I don't know why

I'm going crazy, alone in a daze
And my heart ain't the same
And I don't even think
Unless I think about you
That's the only time I get sentimental (Yeah)
That's the reason why, baby (I can't let go of you, yeah)
That's the only time I get sentimental
You might also like
I miss you day and night
Seems like you're still here
I'd rather be together, honey, oh
Now that I'm lost for words
I can't believe I'm on my own
I should've been looking at love

Now that you're gone, I want you more
I said it slapped me on my face
And now my friends don't understand
Because I had the chance
I don't know why

I'm going crazy, alone in a daze
And my heart ain't the same
And I don't even think
Unless I think about you, mmm
That's the only time I get sentimental (Yeah)
That's the reason why, baby, (I can't let go of you)
I'm going crazy, alone in a daze
And my heart ain't the same
And I don't even think
Unless I think about you, oh
That's the only time I get sentimental (Mhm)
That's the reason why, baby (I can't let go of you, mhm)
That's the only time I get sentimental
Oh, sing it
(That's the only time I get sentimental) Mhm

Now that you're gone, I want you more
I said it slapped me in my face
And then my friends don't understand
'Cause I had the chance
I don't know why

I'm going crazy, alone in a daze
And my heart ain't the same
(My heart just ain't the same)
And I don't even think
Oh no, unless I think about you, you, baby, baby
That's the only time I get sentimental (Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's the reason why, baby (I can't let go of you)
I'm going crazy, alone in a daze
And my heart ain't the same
And I don't even think
Unless I think about you, oh-ho, oh
That's the only time I get sentimental
(That's the only time I think about you, baby, oh yeah, yeah)
That's the reason why, baby
(I can't let go of, can't let go of you, oh, oh, oh)
That's the only time I get sentimental
I can't let go of you
(That's the only time I get, that's the only time I get)
Tell me, baby, baby
(That's the only time I get sentimental)
Oh, oh
