To just act like
We never were
To come around
And not show hurt
How dare we greet
By shaking hands
Just months ago
I was your man (I was your man)

Verbally, we agreed it was over
And we were through
I'm trying to compose myself
But I just can't get over you, girl

We can't be friends
(Oh no, oh no, no, no)
We can't be friends
(Deborah, you know I can't go on being just your friend, yeah)
We can't be friends
'Cause I'm still in love with you, ooh, ooh
(Yeah)

I went by mother's house, saw your car there
To her you're still family, and it don't seem fair
For everyone to just go on
And I've tried and I can't do it
'Cause I'm still torn
You might also like
I've tried to think of you as just another love (Another love)
In the past (In my past), that didn't last
But it's not that simple, baby

We can't be friends
(Oh no, no, no)
We can't be friends
If we, if we can't be lovers
We can't be friends
'Cause I'm still in love

You may see me staring or catch me in a daze
May see me hang my head when you come my way
Don't get to close to me and expect me to behave
I might just still a kiss if you come near my face
What I'm trying to say

(We can't be friends)
(Oh, oh) We can't be friends
Can you look me in the eyes
And honestly say you don't love me? Oh, oh
(Deborah, you know, oh, oh, oh, oh)
We can't be friends (R.L. I know)
(I'll never, ever find another love like you, oh) We can't be friends
I love you too much, baby
I love you too much, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh (Woah)
We can't be friends, I'm still in love with you
With you
I am
Still in love
Still in love (You're making it hard for me)
