It's your life
Thing may not always go right for you
In those times
Just leave it behind
Cause sometimes you gotta play the game
Just to survive
Without losing yourself
It's a fight, it's true
It takes time
Don't have all the answers
No matter how hard it gets
Hold on to what's inside

Don't never let nobody bring you down, girl
Don't never let nobody tear your world apart
Look in the mirror and see who you are
Beautiful you are

In the dark
The pain chips away at your heart
So deep
Can't you see
See the light in the distance
Open up your eye, look, look to the sky (And believe)
There's much more to life when you're free
That's the key and in time
You will find all the answers
Don't have to lose your pride
Hold on to what's inside
You might also like
Don't never let nobody bring you down, girl
Don't never let nobody tear your world apart
Look in the mirror and see who you are
Beautiful you are

Don't never let nobody bring you down, girl
Don't never let nobody tear your world apart
Look in the mirror and see who you are
Beautiful you are

Don't care what they say anymore
There's no time to be insecure
I leave it all at the door
She staring at him in the face
She's taking it day by day
I'm finally on my way

Don't never let nobody bring you down, girl
Don't never let nobody tear your world apart
Look in the mirror and see who you are
Beautiful you are
Don't never let nobody bring you down, girl
Don't never let nobody tear your world apart
Look in the mirror and see who you are
Beautiful you are
Beautiful you are
Beautiful you are
