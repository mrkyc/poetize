A paradise safe and so serene...yeah
A wonder I love so much
Such a rich foundation
To a land of hate and violence
Where did we go wrong?
I'm caught in a war of identity
That threatens to hurt my family
It seems so cold when nobody cares
But now I know
Please won't you show some empathy
Cause if you don't have someone in need
Nobody cares
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na
Ooohh
See us the same not differently
Why would you be afraid of me?
Oh yeah
Cause fear and hate held inside
Encourages this genocide
You can't kill the spirit of life
It never dies!
Ooohh
