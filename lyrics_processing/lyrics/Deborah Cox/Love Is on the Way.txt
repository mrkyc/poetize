Girl, I know
I know I'm the man I'm supposed to be
'Cause you see, I'm just a man
But if you need call
I'll be there, don't worry, yeah
I wanna rock with you (Do you wanna rock with me?)
I wanna rock with you (Do you wanna rock with me?)
I wanna rock with you
(We'll be rockin', baby
We'll be rockin')

Don't you worry love is on the way
As we lay we'll rock the night away
You just name the time and place

I know you miss me
And I've been missing you
Before you know it
I'll be right there next to you
No matter the distance
You're still in my heart
Baby, I'm with you
Even though we are apart
So don't worry
You might also like

I'm never too busy
When it comes to loving you
Hold on I'll be there
'Cause I have plans for me and you
We can hide away in our secret place
The two of us alone again
A special place
Where our love began
So don't you worry

Don't you worry love is on the way
I really miss you (on the way, on the way)
As we lay we'll rock the night away
(We'll rock the night away
We'll rock the night away)
Don't you worry love is on the way
I really miss you
As we lay we'll rock the night away
You just name the time and place

(Hide away) I've been lonely, babe
Hide away late at night, baby
A special place where all our love began
That's where our love began
That's where our love began
Don't you worry love is on the way
I really miss you
As we lay we'll rock the night away
You just name the time and place
Don't you worry
As we lay we'll rock the night away
I wanna rock with you (Do you wanna rock with me?)
I wanna rock with you
I wanna rock with you
You just name the time and place
