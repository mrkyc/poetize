Heard a million stories about love
Some were good some were bad
I found that if you hold on too tight
You might lose everything you have
Didn't think my heart could easily break
When you fall in love that's a chance you take
Now I know from these lessons that I learned from loving you

I know that everybody makes mistakes
I hope you still believe it's not too late
Cause I don't care about what people think or say
I'd rather take a chance with you
I'd rather be in love than be alone
But I never knew that love could hurt so much
Mmm hmm, ohh so much

I found it in my heart to forgive
But it's hard to forget
Cause everyday the vision creeps in
Of you and somebody else
All my girls told me to let you go
But I know they're wrong
I still love you so
I'll hold on 'til I gain back the trust I had in you
You might also like
I know that everybody makes mistakes
I hope you still believe it's not too late
Cause I don't care about what people think or say
I'd rather take a chance with you
I'd rather be in love than be alone
But I never knew that love could hurt so much

It's killing me but I'll get over it
But I made my commitment to you
Even though it's gonna leave a scar
It could never change what's in my heart
I'll do whatever to stay together

I know that everybody makes mistakes
I hope you still believe it's not too late
Cause I don't care about what people think or say
I'd rather take a chance with you
I'd rather be in love than be alone
But I never knew that love could hurt so much

I know that everybody makes mistakes
I hope you still believe it's not too late
Cause I don't care about what people think or say
I'd rather take a chance with you
I'd rather be in love than be alone
