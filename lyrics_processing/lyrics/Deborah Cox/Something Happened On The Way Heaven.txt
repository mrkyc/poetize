But you don't know what you've got 'til you lose it
Well, that was then and this is now
And I want you back, how many times can I say I'm sorry
Oh yes, I'm sorry
How could something so good go so bad
How could something so right go so wrong
I don't know, I don't have all the answers
But I want you back, how many times can I say I'm sorry
Oh yes, I'm sorry
(You can run and you can hide)
But I'm not leaving 'less you come with me
(We've had our problems, but I'm on your side)
You're all I need, please, believe in me
(You can run and you can hide)
But I'm not leaving 'less you come with me
(We've had our problems, but I'm on your side)
You're all I need, please, believe in me
I only wanted you as someone to love
But something happened on the way to heaven
It got a hold of me and wouldn't let go
And I want you back, how many times can I say I'm sorry
Oh yes, I'm sorry
You might also likeOh, you can run, you can hide
(You can run and you can hide)
But I'm not leaving 'less you come with me
(We've had our problems, but I'm on your side)
You're all I need, so please, believe in me
(You can run and you can hide)
I'm not leaving unless you're here with me, baby
(We've had our problems, but I'm on your side)
You're all I need, please, believe in me
They say you can't take it with you when you go
And I believe it
But taking what I've got or being here with you
You know I'd rather leave it all
Baby, stay with me
(You can run and you can hide)
Oh, stay with me, baby
(We've had our problems, but I'm on your side)
You're all I need, so please, believe in me
(You can run and you can hide)
But I'm not leaving, 'less you come with me
(We've had our problems, but I'm on your side)
Oh, I'm on your side
(You can run and you can hide)
I'm on your side
(We've had our problems, but I'm on your side)
(You can run and you can hide)
