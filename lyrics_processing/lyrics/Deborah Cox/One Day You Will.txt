You don't miss me now, you don't miss me now
You don't miss me now, you don't miss me now (You don't miss me now)

One day you will be walking down the street, yeah
And you'll see someone and she will look a lot like me
And you'll think about someone you've left behind
And it will make you cry
One day you will be starting out your day, yeah
And you'll look inside your coffee cup and see my face
And you'll realize the sad mistake you made
And it will be too late, ooh

One day you'll wonder why you ever said goodbye
And you will wish you were still right here by my side, oh
But I won't be around, no
You don't miss me now, you don't miss me now
One day you will

Never find a love like what we had
Never find someone like me again
Through the tears one day you'll see
That the one you need is me
You'll want me back again
You'll want me back again
Oh, one day you will be driving in your car, yeah
And you're gonna hear a song that's gonna break your heart
And you'll wish you said those words you didn't say
And it will be too late
You might also like
One day you'll wonder why you ever said goodbye
And you will wish you were still right here right by my side, oh
But baby, I won't be around, oh, no, no, no
You don't miss me now, you don't miss me now

One day you will be walking down the street, oh yeah
And you'll see someone and she will look a lot like me
And you'll think about someone you left behind
And it will make you cry, oh (Make you cry)

You don't miss me now, you just don't miss me now
You don't miss me now, you don't miss me now, oh
You don't miss me now, you don't miss me now
But one day you will
One day you will
