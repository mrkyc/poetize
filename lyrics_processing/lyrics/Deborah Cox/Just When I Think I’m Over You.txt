I used to think about it back then
You walked in and said you're leaving me
Goodbye, goodbye
I don't know why I never woke up
Torch of your love you'd given me had died
So I erased you from my mind, but

Just when I think I'm over you
I feel your body cry
Making love to you
Just when I think I'm over you
I hear a song that plays
That we once danced to

I used to think about how you'd play
The way you would hurt
The way that'd say goodbye, goodbye
And all the lies, they did you no good
You'd live with yourself
I hated you inside 'cause you were over me

Just when I think I'm over you
I feel your body cry
Making love to you
(Making love to you, baby)
Just when I think I'm over you
I hear a song that plays
That we once danced to
Just when I think I'm over you
I feel the pain again
Whenever I see you
Just when I thought that we were done
Baby, time has taught me you were the one
You might also like
When you were there I didn't realize
All the things you meant to me 'til you were gone
And now you're just a memory
I'm still not over you
So let's dance
Make 'em dance
Come on and dance
I'm still not over you
So let's dance
Make 'em dance
Come on and dance
Just when I

Just when I think I'm over you
I feel your body cry
Making love to you
(Making love to you, baby)
Just when I think I'm over you
I hear a song that plays (Hear a song)
That we once danced to
(Just when I am over you)
Just when I think I'm over you
I feel the pain again (Feel the pain)
Whenever I see you (Whenever I'm with you)
Just when I thought that we were done
Baby, time has taught me you were the one
(Oh oh baby)
Just when I think I'm over you
I feel your body cry
Making love to you
(Making sweet love to you)
Just when I think I'm over you
I hear a song that plays (Hear a song that plays)
That we once danced to (That we once knew)
Just when I think I'm over you
(I'm still not over you)
I feel the pain again (Feel the pain)
Whenever I see you
Just when I thought that we were done
