Oooh baby, I didn't come here to fight
Why you wanna mess with me?
Oooh, I'm always willin' to compromise
But you ain't controllin' me, no

Cause I came here to make love not war with you babe
So try to find some ways to make me feel good

Up and down, in and out, that's what love is all about
Always leaves both of us feelin' good or helpless
Up and down, in and out, love keeps movin' us around
To the beat, like a drum
I don't know if I can catch the rhythm

Oooh, you know me better than I know myself
So why you keep teasin' me?
Mmmh, I can't seem to deal with nobody else
Cause you love me so crazy, yeah

Cause I came here to make love not war with you babe
So try to find some ways to make me feel good
