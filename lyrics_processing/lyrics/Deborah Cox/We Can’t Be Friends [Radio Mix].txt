To just act like we never were
To come around and not show hurt
How dare we greet by shaking hands
Just months ago, I was your man, was your man
Verbaly we agreed it was over
And we were through
I'm trying to compose myself
But I just can't get over you, girl
We can't be friends
(Yeah, no oh)
We can't be friends
(Deborah, you know I can't go on being just your friend, yeah)
We can't be friends
Cuz I'm still in love with you
(Deb)
I went by mother's, saw your car there
To her you're still family
And it don't seem fair
For everyone to just go on
And I've tried and I can't do it
Cuz I'm still torn
You might also likeI tried to think of you as just another love
In my past that didn't last
But it's not that simple, baby
We can't be friends
(Oh no, no, no, no)
We can't be friends
(If we, if we can't be lovers)
We can't be friends
Cuz I'm still in love
(Both)
You may see me staring
Or catch me in a daze
May see me hang my head
When you come my way
Don't get too close to me
And expect me to behave
(RL ) I might just steal a kiss
(Both) If you come near my face
What I'm trying to say
Repeat 1 while:
(RL ) We can't be friends
(Deb ) Can you look me in the eyes
And honestly say you dont love me?
(RL ) Said do you know
(Deb ) R.L. I know
(Both) I'll never ever find another love like you, oh no
(RL ) I love you too much baby
(Deb ) I love you too much, oh
(Both) We can't be friends, I'm still in love
(Deb ) with you
(RL ) With you
(Deb ) I am
(RL ) Still in love
(Deb ) Still in love
