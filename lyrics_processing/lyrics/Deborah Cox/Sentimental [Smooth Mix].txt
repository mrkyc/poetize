Yeah...
Ooh... (That's the only time I get sentimental...)
Hmm...
I used to mess around, but I never let it get into me
'Cause I didn't take you serious, baby...
Now to be without your love, only makes me realize
What I could've had in you, honey...
Now that you're gone, I want you more
I said it slapped me in my face
And then, my friends don't understand
Because I had the chance - I don't know why...
I'm going crazy, alone in a daze, and my heart ain't the same
And I don't even think unless I think about you... mm...
That's the only time I get sentimental... yeah...
That's the reason why, baby, I can't let go of you...
Yeah... that's the only time I get sentimental...
I miss you day and night - seems like you're still here;
I'd rather be together, honey... oh...
Now that I'm lost for words, I can't believe I'm on my own;
I should've been looking at love...
