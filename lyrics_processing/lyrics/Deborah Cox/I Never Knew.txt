Oh yeah, ooh
Ooh, ah

It was a cold day in December
I remember it so well
You captured my whole being
And you left me in a spell
You warmed my heart with passion
Desiring all of you
You left me cold in the summer
I wish that I only knew
But I

I never knew that you would be the one
To come along and snatch my heart and run
Away from me with no explanation why
I never knew what we had would die
All I wanna do is hide away
From all the hurt and pain of yesterday
Don't you see the tears of hurt inside
I never knew, please tell me why (Why?)

All the nights you left me crying
Keeping company with my fears
That someday you'll leave me lonely
And that's exactly what you did
I swore that I was your baby
The darkest night for you I bare
Now that I need you here with me
I call your name and you're not there
You might also like
You left me standing (So)
So empty-handed
Out in the cold
How was I to know that
My love didn't matter
My world was shattered
'Cause you left me here
Drowning in tears, oh I

I never knew that you would be the one
To come along and snatch my heart and run
Away from me with no explanation why
I never knew what we had would die
All I wanna do is hide away
From all the hurt and pain of yesterday
Can't you see the tears of hurt inside
I never knew, please tell me why

After we made plans
To spend our lives together
I thought what we had
Was meant to be forever
Oh why did our love have to go away
I don't know how, I don't know when
But I know I'll never love this way again
I never knew that you would be the one
To come along and snatch my heart and run
Away from me with no explanation why
(No explanation why)
I never knew what we had would die
All I wanna do is hide away (Hide away, baby)
From all the hurt and pain of yesterday
Can't you see the tears of hurt inside (Hurt inside)
I never knew, please tell me why
(Can't you see what you've done to me?)
I never knew that you would be the one
(Snatched my heart and left me lonely)
To come along and snatch my heart and run (Why, oh why?)
Away from me with no explanation why (Tell me why)
I never knew what we had would die
All I wanna do is hide away (Hide away)
From all the hurt and pain of yesterday (Pain of yesterday)
Can't you see the tears of hurt inside (Inside)
I never knew, please tell me why

I never knew, I never knew
(Never knew)
I never knew I never knew
(I never knew it, baby)
I never knew, I never knew
(Never knew)
I never knew, I never knew it would be like this
I never knew, I never knew
(I never knew)
I never knew I never knew
(I never knew it, baby)
I never knew, I never knew
(Never knew, no)
