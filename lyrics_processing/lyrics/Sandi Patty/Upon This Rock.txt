Just what they want to see
You will see the things that never die
You will know and recognize
By simple childlike faith
The priceless truth that others will deny
When others say I'm just a man
Who'd liked to dream His dreams
When others call a miracle a myth
You'll listen for eternity
In moments as they pass
And see with spirit eyes what others miss
Upon this rock, I'll build My kingdom
And on this rock, forever and ever it shall stand
And all the powers of Hell itself
Shall never more prevail against it
For Satan's thrones are built on sinking sand
Upon this rock, I'll build My kingdom
And on this rock, forever and ever it shall stand
Upon this rock of revelation
I'll build a strong and mighty nation
And it shall stand the storms of time
Upon this rock
You might also likeIf in a simple carpenter
You see the Son of God
If you would chose to lose
When you could win
If you would give your life away
For nothing in return
Then you are where My kingdom will begin
Upon this rock, I'll build My kingdom
And on this rock, forever and ever it shall stand
And all the powers of Hell itself
Shall never more prevail against it
For Satan's thrones are built on sinking sand
Upon this rock, I'll build My kingdom
And on this rock, forever and ever it shall stand
Upon this rock of revelation
I'll build a strong and mighty nation
And it shall stand the storms of time
Upon this rock, I'll build My kingdom
And on this rock, forever and ever it shall stand
Upon this rock of revelation
I'll build a strong and mighty nation
And it shall stand the storms of time
Upon this rock
I'll build My church upon this rock
