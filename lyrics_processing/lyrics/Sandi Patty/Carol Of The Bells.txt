All seem to say, throw cares away
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer
To young and old, meek and the bold
Ding-dong ding-dong, that is our song
With cheerful ring, all caroling
One seems to hear words of good cheer
From everywhere, filling the air
Oh, how they pound, raising the sound
O'er hill and dale, telling their tale
Gayly they ring while people sing
Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas
(Merry Christmas)
Hark, how the bells, sweet silver bells
All seem to say, throw cares away
(The bells seem to say, throw cares away)
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer
To young and old, meek and the bold
(Meek and the bold)
