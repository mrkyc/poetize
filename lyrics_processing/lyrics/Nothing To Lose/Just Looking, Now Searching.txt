I know theres much to learn and i know theres much to see
But deep inside your heart where our lost love can be found
Theres a guy that waits for you but he's waiting until now
She's going away away from me
And now she's gone and now i see
That if i look away there's a lesson learned
That it's over now it's lost forever
What if i woke up in my dreams
Exactly how real would it seem
Would it be sure to last forever
Would you be right there by my side
Would you be with me for the ride
There's nothing that we could not endeavor
Even though i've been alone without you holding me
The jerk that holds you know has something over me
If theres such a thing as love and i'm sure there probably is
Then your love has skipped my heart and i'm hurting all within
She's going away away from me
And now she's gone and now i see
That if i look away there's a lesson learned
That it's over now it's lost forever
What if i woke up in my dreams
Exactly how it wouldn't seem
Would it be sure to last forever
Would you be right there by my side
I'd be there with you for the ride
There's nothing that we could not endeavor

Around for this long
You start to go down i come along
The only time life seems fair is when i sleep later on
So you know i'll be sleeping when you're gone
