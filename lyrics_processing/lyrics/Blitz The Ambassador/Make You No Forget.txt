Police Corruption/ They steal election/
Brutality my brothers no get option/
Thats why (You don't Forget where you come from)

Chale, Make we sit make we chat some / Its been a minute since me den you reason way we laugh some/ You dey kai the time wey we be kiddies anaa?
The Chaskele/ Pilolo's and the Panpanaa's/ Watching Osofo Dadzie we thought we will never grow up/ By The Fire Side Maame Dokono was so hot/ But non was hotter than Uncle George Laing/ Kye Kye Kule Kye Kye Kofisa drove us insane/ Chale/ You dey kai Italia 90 den the goal wey Roger Milla score dancing with the flag pole/ Better yet yet / You dey kai Senegal 92/ Ghana den Ivory Coast/They say the keeper use Juju/ Oh Chale/ the cell phones from back in the day?
Mobitel/ Megyina abonten na merekasa/ Well some things change and some might not/ But when they reminisce over you/ My God

Ohh hah, I say (Make you no forgeti where where you from) 4x
As the weather dey hot/ na so the hunger dey knock/
Still hating the cops whether they like it or not/
Thats why (You don't Forget where you come from)

Oh Chale/ Look how we all come grow/
Secondary school time catch no be small/ Me, I go Motown where you learn to survive/ Gari and Shito was the ish that kept us all alive/ But wedge you dey kai the night clubs for Osu? You shada fine fine/ Go wey they bounce you/ So you go change your clothes come back they let you in just to realize you should have stayed your ass at home/ Cos the London boys dey here/ The Yankee Girls dey there/ the Dadabees dey mingle and you are all alone chale/ these were the days Groove FM never missed us/ From Bush K to Woodman to Super Soul Sister/ But I gotta say, looking back in the day/ Nobody shook Accra quite like Acapulco Bay/ Cos somethings change and some might not/ But when they reminisce over you/ My God!
