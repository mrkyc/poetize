And Are We Out Of Sight?
Or Will Our World Come Tumbling Down?
Will They Find Our Hiding Place?
Is This Our Last Embrace?
Or Will The Walls Start Caving In?
(It Could Be Wrong, Could Be Wrong)
But It Should've Been Right
(It Could Be Wrong, Could Be Wrong)
Let Our Hearts Ignite
(It Could Be Wrong, Could Be Wrong)
Are We Digging A Hole?
(It Could Be Wrong, Could Be Wrong)
This Is Outta Control
(It Could Be Wrong, Could Be Wrong)
It Could Never Last
(It Could Be Wrong, Could Be Wrong)
Must Erase It Fast
(It Could Be Wrong, Could Be Wrong)
But It Could've Been Right
(It Could Be Wrong, Could Be...)
Love Is Our Resistance
They Keep Us Apart And They Won't Stop Breaking Us Down
And Hold Me, Our Lips Must Always Be Sealed
If We Live Our Life In Fear
I'll Wait A Thousand Years
Just To See You Smile Again
Kill Your Prayers For Love And Peace
You'll Wake The Thought Police
We Can Hide The Truth Inside
(It Could Be Wrong, Could Be Wrong)
But It Should've Been Right
(It Could Be Wrong, Could Be Wrong)
Let Our Hearts Ignite
(It Could Be Wrong, Could Be Wrong)
Are We Digging A Hole?
(It Could Be Wrong, Could Be Wrong)
This Is Outta Control
(It Could Be Wrong, Could Be Wrong)
It Could Never Last
(It Could Be Wrong, Could Be Wrong)
Must Erase It Fast
(It Could Be Wrong, Could Be Wrong)
But It Could've Been Right
(It Could Be Wrong, Could Be...)
Love Is Our Resistance!
They Keep Us Apart And Won't Stop Breaking Us Down
And Hold Me, Our Lips Must Always Be Sealed
The Night Has Reached Its End
We Can't Pretend
We Must Run
We Must Run
It's Time To Run
Take Us Away From Here
Protect Us From Further Harm
