If anybody feelin' fresh in the buildin'
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceilin' right now
And say, "Damn, I'm killin' them, damn, I'm killin' them"
I know they feelin' me now
And if you too fresh in the buildin'
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceilin' right now (Right now)
And say, "Damn, I'm killin' them (Damn), damn, I'm killin' them" (Damn)
I know they feelin' me now

And I'm still here with a lifestyle you would kill for (Brap!)
Still here with the same shoes that I had on from the get-go (Yeah)
Straight out of Atlanta, Georgia, for any of y'all that didn't know (Eastside)
And I'm never that hard to find because 420 is my zip code (Haha, yeah)
But back then, couldn't get dro (Nah) 'cause back then, I was this broke (Yeah)
That's why I got so many hustles (Uh), bruh man from the fifth floor (Nah)
What would you do in the middle of the winter
When the sun goes down and it gets cold?
Growin' up in a house with no stove
No doors, no walls, no windows
And my brother was always fresher
I would go to school in his clothes, when I did go
So that's why now this the type of life that I live for
Comin' up as a youngin', man, some nights I would vomit
I would throw up on myself 'cause I was so sick to my stomach
Now I'm the shit, fix the plumbin'
Bare with me y'all, I'm this close (This close)
Spent my whole life chasin' chips, where's Nabisco? (Where's Nabisco?)
My past memories, I miss those (Miss those)

I know they feelin' me now (Ayy, hey!)

I'm fresh off my pit-stop, my flow airtight with no Ziploc (Bah!)
Get shit poppin' when my shit drop (Bah!), no hip-hop, this Tip hop (Yeah)
I'm back standin' at the tip top where I belong, it won't be long
'Til you hear me on a B.o.B song (Ah), some chick gettin' my skeet on (Skeet)
To touch the sole of my feet, G, you gon' have to get your reach on (Ah)
I'm up all the way high, all the way fly, on the ground, I'm off the radar
Bernie Madoff money, dawg, got killers paid off with it all
I got the juice (Hello), could you place a call? And we place a call to who place a call (Go)
Beg your pardon, not too hard, I disregard what you say (Yeah)
Back up the truck and pass the buck, here's where it's stoppin' today
Got swag all on me, homie, can't wipe it away, we too ill, ill
That's how we got arenas, domes, and stadiums filled (Cyeah, cyeah, cyeah)
Ayy, how you feel?

And I'm still here in a black whip full of strange clouds (Full of strange clouds)
And I'm still here with the same team, nigga, stay down
Still here for the Eastside, ain't a thang change but the bank 'count (Eastside, ha!)
Hands high when I come 'round 'cause I'm killin' this shit, nigga, hands down (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
And I go hard, my passport's like a postcard (Ha)
Give a fuck if I'm solo, I'll go toe-to-toe with your whole squad (Yes)
With the soul of a soldier, but even still, I don't want no parts
And no niggas with no hearts, you cocksuckers need throat guards
I'm throwed off for the most part, a young dog with a old bark (Woof)
Flow dumb, but I'm so smart (Ha), I compose art, call me Mozart
My nightlife's like a soap opera (Yeah) with two chicks like it's Noah's ark
They got nice dresses with no bras with good bodies like, "Oh God" (Oh God)
From a poor child to on top like a mohawk (Ha) (Ha)
But I always knew I'd go far like a gas truck with no park (No park)
So no applause (No applause), hold the applause
Just put your hand up if you know the song
