Ooh, unsuccessful people talk the most shit that's just what they do
No squares in my circle cause they don't fit we don't fuck with you
So that's why making money makes the most sense get your revenue
So all I do is work and get high so excuse me for my
Bloody red eyes
Bloody red eyes
Bloody red eyes
Bloody red eyes

Ooh, niggas always talking cause it so cheap
Ooh, this is how it look when you don't sleep
Ooh, strangers always acting like they know me
Ooh, fresh up off work 'bout to roll tree
I roll a whole tree, this shit is so deep
I got the whole world, wishing for the old me
And I don't say shit, even if they owed me
All I remember is, what my momma told me, my momma told me

Snakes, they always smiling in your faces
Fake friends, yeah they just fake it till they make it
Until they make it, that's when they act the fakest
Shit go from "You like family" to "Fuck nah, we ain't related"
So fuck nah, we ain't related there's no affiliation
Money always take a good thing and complicate shit
How you stop yourself from a mistake before you make it
If you never seen a problem can't solve for the equation
So niggas out here underestimating
Even a fuck you takes up too much time and energy to say it
And if time is money I won't mind in the AM
Don't wake me in the AM unless you talking 8 M's
Who really down? Who really gon' hold you down?
Them niggas ain't really your dog, they be fucking your bitch when you out of town
You was blind till now
Every hand that come to the king to protect, they be close cause they want that crown
But soon as the shine wears off they're nowhere to be found
Down
