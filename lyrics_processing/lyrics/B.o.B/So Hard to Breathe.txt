Since day one, I said fuck the fame and everything it dealt (Okay)
But the fame is really here just to facilitate the wealth (Okay)
But the wealth attracts you haters like mosquitos to a well
And the waters gettin' deeper, so I must set out to sail (Okay)
Someone called my cell (Huh) and left a voicemail (Uh-huh)
They said, "Congratulations on the million-record sales"
As I'm flippin' over furniture (Argh!) Knockin' shit off the shelf
I told myself I'd never get too deep to take a breath
But I'm sinkin'
(Damn) And it's so hard to breathe
Yeah
And even more so to sleep
When no one cares
It was all I could need
But now I'm sinking, so deep
I can't come up for air

Yeah, I've seen the valley (Valley)
Of the shadow of death (Uh-huh,) I've seen the mountains (Mountains)
A wild childhood (Yeah,) that's why I sing about it ('Bout it)
I just try to move on and keep my peace about it ('Bout it)
But come to think about it, I can't even count the days (Yeah)
That I spent starvin' (Yeah,) tryna find some decent housin'
It's why I'm always smilin', but on this beat, I seem so violent
So ask me 'bout the music scene and what the fuck I think about it
Time flies, I guess that's why I'm buggin'
Just yesterday I was rappin' with my brother and my cousin
If you had the stove or toaster on you couldn't use the oven
We knew that we were strugglin' we just acted like we wasn't
It was either make it rappin', if not that, then hustlin' (Hustlin')
So all I see is magazine covers in this game
You either surface or you plummet, it's a thin line, and I'm just tryna
Keep my head above it, damn
You might also like
And it's so hard to breathe
Yeah
And even more so to sleep
When no one cares
It was all I could need
But now I'm sinking, so deep
I can't come up for air

Air
I
(I sink away)
Air (I sink away)
Air (As I sink away)
I (Damn, I sink away)
Damn, damn (Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy)
I sink away (Bobby Bands, Bobby Bands)
Get carried away (Damn)
Get carried away, yeah (This was never in the plans, but, hey
It's a long way from beatin' pots and pans)
And it's so hard to breathe (Woo)
Yeah (Hey!)
And even more so to sleep
When no one cares (Nobody cares)
It was all I could need (It was all I could need)
But now I'm sinking (Hey!) So deep
Damn, this was never in the plans, but, hey
It's a long way from beatin' pots and pans
Damn, this was never in the plans, but, hey
It's a long way from beatin' pots and pans
Damn, this was never in the plans, but, hey
It's a long way from beatin' pots and pans
Damn, this was never in the plans, but, hey
It's a long way from beatin' pots and pans
