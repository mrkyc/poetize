I know one day, I won't have to wait in line
I know one day, I'ma get those keys to that new ride
I know one day I'll be fine
And I know one day I'll get mine
And I know one day
Hell it might be Monday

I remember thinkin': "Man, I need a decent ride"
And I won't have to ask my momma for the keys to drive
With my brother ridin' in an old Cutlass
Black and Mild lit, whole roof busted
Well who knows, maybe one day we'll have a little more
We'll finally shop somewhere else besides the corner store
My little sister say she gotta have a pair of Dior's
But right now they'll probably stop us 'fore we hit the door
My Uncle says: "That's how it is where we come from"
And if it weren't for bad luck, we wouldn't have none
Hard to tell the good days from the bad ones
If I could catch a shooting star then I'd grab one
I'd grab one, for real

I know one day, I won't have to wait in line
I know one day, I'ma get those keys to that new ride
I know one day I'll be fine
And I know one day I'll get mine
And I know one day
Hell it might be Monday

I remember feelin' trapped and no I couldn't get out
And when they laid my momma off, no it just didn't amount
I still remember how she looked when she walked into the house
But still she tried her best to show me what was Christmas about
And if we wanted hot water, we had to microwave it
And everyday the power'd cut off, but we'd tolerate it
The thoughts of all the beats I lost because I forgot to save 'em
I'm screaming at me in the mirror like: "I gotta make it!"
My teacher's tryna get through to me 'cause of my behavior
I said: "I got big dreams, and I gotta chase 'em"
I never cared a damn thing 'bout a college major
I only had one need, that was a lot of paper
But see, I never had a thing but a lotta prayers
After school, open mic night, rockin' stages
It all started from a demo, to a limo
From a limo, to a Lambo
And all of this came up out of Decatur
'Cause one day...

I know one day, I won't have to wait in line
I know one day, I'ma get those keys to that new ride
I know one day I'll be fine
And I know one day I'll get mine
And I know one day
Hell it might be Monday
One day, one day, one day, one day
One day, one day, one day, one day

I used to dream about these days and the things that I'd do
I had to get a new life, 'cause the old just won't do
I used to dream shades of grey, now the sky's shining blue
And everyday it feels like, there's no way I can lose

'Cause I knew one day, I wouldn't have to wait in line
I knew one day, I would get those keys to that new ride
I knew one day I'd be fine
And I knew one day I'd get mine
Yeah I knew one day
And not just Monday
