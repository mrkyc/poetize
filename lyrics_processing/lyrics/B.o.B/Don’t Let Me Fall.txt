Well, it was just a dream, just a moment ago
I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall
I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

'Cause I'm glidin' up there, oh so very high that if the
Clouds were to drop me then I'd, fall out the sky, I don't really
Know why I'm here, I guess I'm, just here for the ride, I swear it
Feels like I'm dreamin', it's vividly defined, yeah
So call me whatever you want, title me whatever you like
But let's get one thing straight, you know my name
So I run this town, when I'm on this mic, yeah
So here I go, B.o.B, Bobby Ray, I don't know, need I know
But I know, that I flow, rack 'em up, knock 'em down, dominoes
Then I go, as my story goes
I know I've done been down here before
Product of my East Decatur home
'Cause I was in the cold, tryna keep my toes unfroze
Now I'm in your house, now I'm in your soul
Now I'm everywhere that your iPod go
Everything I seen was a dream just a moment ago

Well, it was just a dream, just a moment ago
I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall
I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

Yeah, well I'm from much lower than where that pavement is
'Cause there ain't no parachute that they can make for this
'Cause I put my pain, my heart, my soul, my faith in this
Does anyone feel like how I feel? Then you can relate to this
Or just blaze to this, maybe roll one up, then take a hit
Toast to the good life then take a sip
Vacay everyday, yeah take a trip
It's easy to see I was made for this
From the womb all the way to the grave I spit
Just to show y'all niggas what greatness is, yeah
I'm talkin' very lucid, like makin' movies
To picture my life boy, you need a higher resolution
I used to cut class in the day, then run away at night
But now I'm ruler of the upper class and I don't even write
Well, it was just a dream, just a moment ago
I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall
I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
