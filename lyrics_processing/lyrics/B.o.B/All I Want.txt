I want everything I see, I wanna go in every mall, in every state, in every country, and buy shit
Whether I can afford it or not, nigga, I want bitches, I want cars, I don't give a fuck, I want it all, that's what the fuck we're here for

They say, "Life is but a dream," nigga
I'm just tryna keep it real, nigga
They say, "Life is but a dream," nigga
I'm just tryna keep it real, nigga
They say, "Life is but a dream," nigga
I'm just tryna keep it real, nigga
They say, "Life is but a dream," nigga

It's just so many women, it's just so many chains
It's just so many watches, it's just too many things
I want (Woah, woah, woah)
It's just so many trips, it's just so many bottles
It's just too many whips, it's just too many models
I want (Woah, woah, woah)

All I want is money; money, money, money (That's all I want)
Big face hundred; hundred, hundred, hundred (That's all I want)
That's all I want (That, that, that's all I want)
That's all I want (That, that, that's all I want)

Not a day goes by it ain't on my mind
I ain't gon' front, I ain't gon' lie
I'd rather have an M than an empty pocket
If hundreds ain't in 'em, them jeans ain't mine, aight
That's what I want, motherfucker
I'll never be a bum, motherfucker
You're talking 'bout like "it ain't about the money"
You just sound like a dumb motherfucker
A house on the hill by the lake
All real niggas can relate
You tryna book me for free?
But my rent is due on today
A better life is what we after
'Cause every dream I gotta capture
I always knew that I would blow up one day
Like a nuclear reactor

All I want is money; money, money, money (That's all I want)
Big face hundred; hundred, hundred, hundred (That's all I want)
That's all I want (That, that, that's all I want)
That's all I want (That, that, that's all I want)

From the cradle to a label
From Decatur to the majors to the paper, no more neighbors
I used to say I never cared about the money
'Til I put food on my momma table
Followed the trail, coulda been in jail
The way that I lived, coulda been fatal
I must have had an angel
It's funny how I'm always on the screen
But as a teen, I never had cable
But now I want it all
The wealth, the ladies, the whips
I took a fantasy and made it exist
No one ever handed us shit
We took what we had and we made it the shit
That's transforming "dusty" to "luxury"
Being off in the cut, to cutlery
That's the gist, that's the summary
So if you feel how I'm feeling then fuck with me
All I want is money; money, money, money (That's all I want)
Big face hundred; hundred, hundred, hundred (That's all I want)
That's all I want (That, that, that's all I want)
That's all I want (That, that, that's all I want)
All I want is money; money, money, money (That's all I want)
Big face hundred; hundred, hundred, hundred (That's all I want)
That's all I want (That, that, that's all I want)
That's all I want (That, that, that's all I want)

It's just so many women, it's just so many chains
It's just so many watches, it's just too many things
