I see you, you on the edge of your seat
Ain't you got some place to be?
Was hoping the suspense would kill you
Tell me, how would you begin?
Watching and waiting to sink your teeth in
Come on and give me your expert opinion, ah, fuck it
I settle down in a dump
Heard a crowd screaming "Jump"
So I came to the window
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
I said, "What the fuck have I done?"
They said, "We just want your blood
You know we like you better in limbo"
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)

So come on and take a shot, you just can't get enough
Don't let the fact that you know nothing stop you talking now
'Cause when all is said and done, my name's still on your tongue

But tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
You better pray I don't get up this time around (Ooh)
And why you tryna put me in the ground?
Don't you know I'm a seed? (I'm a seed) I won't stop at the roof
Go ahead, bury me; this is how I grow, it's how I thrive (Ooh)
So why you gotta kick me when I'm down? (Down)
(Why you gotta kick me when I'm down? Ooh)
You might also like
Yeah, I know it's all in good fun, but
Don't say it's coming from love, no
I see those arms in akimbo
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
And don't set that phaser to stun 'cause
What doesn't kill me, well, it better run like hell
Yeah, you better run like hell

So come on and take a shot, you just can't get enough
Don't let the fact that you know nothing stop you talking now
'Cause when all is said and done, my name's still on your tongue

So tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
You better pray I don't get up this time around (Ooh)
And why you tryna put me in the ground?
Don't you know I'm a seed? (I'm a seed) I won't stop at the roof
Go ahead, bury me; this is how I grow, it's how I thrive (Ooh)

Remember this line that you crossed
Look back and stare at the dot
Know there's no turning back now
Now, that you've opened the gates
Corrupted the memory, error, failsafe
(Commence the countdown)
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
Remember this line that you crossed
Look back and stare at the dot
Know there's no way to fix us, no
Oh, God, what the fuck have you done?
I loved you like daughters, I loved you like sons
So tell me, yeah, tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
You better pray I don't get up this time around (Ooh)
And why you tryna put me in the ground?
Don't you know I'm a seed? (I'm a seed) I won't stop at the roof
Go ahead, bury me; this is how I grow, it's how I thrive (Ooh)
Why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
But tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
