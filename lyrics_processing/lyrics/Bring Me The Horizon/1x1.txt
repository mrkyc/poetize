Put me outta my misery

Disconnected from the world again
And no, the sun don't shine in the place I've been
So why you keep acting like I don't exist?
Yeah, feel like I'm ready to die, but I can't commit

So I ask myself, when will I learn?
I'd set myself on fire to feel the burn
I'm scared that I'm never gonna be repaired

Put me outta my misery, my mind
Feels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyes
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go
Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by one

Sabotaged myself again
Got a brain like a hurricane
Me and that bitch, no, we can't be friends
And I don't even care, no
Got me sinking to a dark place (Outta love)
Evil twin under the staircase (Oh, my God)
Think I'm looking at a long night
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone
You might also like
Terrified (Terrified), I'm numb (But I'm numb)
Annihilation never looked so good, shut up
Hush your mouth, you talk too much

Put me outta my misery, my mind
Feels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyes
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go
Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by one

And I'm staring into the void again, no one knows what a mess I'm in
The voices in my head say I'm just being paranoid
But it's bad for my health, how much I hate myself
I suffocate, the weight, it pulls me underneath

Put me outta my misery, my mind
Feels like an archenemy, can't look me in the eyes
I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go
Reliving my memories and they're killing me one by one

Yeah, it's killing me one by one
