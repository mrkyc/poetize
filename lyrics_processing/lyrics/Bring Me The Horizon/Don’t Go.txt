I was raised in the valley, there was shadows and death
Got out alive but with scars, I can't forget
This kid back in school, subdued and shy
An orphan and a brother and unseen by most eyes
I don't know what it was that made a piece of him die
Took a boy to the forest, slaughtered him with a scythe
Stamped on his face, an impression in the dirt
Do you think the silence makes a good man convert?

We all have our horrors and our demons to fight
But how can I win when I'm paralysed?
They crawl up on my bed, wrap their fingers 'round my throat
Is this what I get for the choices that I made?
God, forgive me for all my sins
God, forgive me for everything
God, forgive me for all my sins
God, forgive me; God, forgive me

Don't go, I can't do this on my own
Don't go, I can't do this on my own
Save me from the ones that haunt me in the night
I can't live with myself, so stay with me tonight
(Don't go)
(Don't go)
You might also like
If I let you in, you'd just want out
If I tell you the truth, you'd vie for a lie
If I spilt my guts, it would make a mess we can't clean up
If you follow me, you will only get lost
If you try to get closer, we'll only lose touch
Yes, you already know too much and you're not goin' anywhere

Tell me that you need me 'cause I love you so much
Tell me that you love me 'cause I need you so much
Tell me that you need me 'cause I love you so much
Say you'll never leave me 'cause I need you so much


Don't go, I can't do this on my own
Don't go, I can't do this on my own
Save me from the ones that haunt me in the night
I can't live with myself, so stay with me tonight
Don't go, I can't do this on my own
Don't go
Save me from the ones that haunt me in the night
I can't live with myself, so stay with me tonight
Don't go
Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go
Don't go (Tell me that you love me)
Don't go (Tell me that you need me)
Don't go (Tell me that you love me)
Don't go (Tell me that you need me)
