Count down the thunder
I think we're too close for comfort
So no, don't rock the boat and don't calm the storm
God already gave you His answer
Blink, I'm sorry, it's over, the whistle's been blown, I
Think you got the wrong number, I'm breaking up
Wanna make a connection, can't get no reception
Leave a message after the tone

'Cause it's got my head running 24/7
I don't know if I can figure it out
It's all messed up, only one thing I know for sure
We're so full of

Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
(Everybody's full of)
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea

Don't move a muscle
No, we can't have a struggle
But the situation is in control
So play pretend that it's all good
You could tell the Messiah
His pants are on fire, I politely decline, I
I gotta go, I gotta stick my head in the sand
And block out all the sadness, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I don't know if I can figure it out
It's all messed up, only one thing I know for sure
We're so full of

Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
(Yeah, everybody's full of)
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea

And it's got my head running 24/7
I don't reckon I can figure it out
It's all messed up, only one thing I know for sure
(We're so full of)
And we all march on like we know the way to Heaven
Who the hell died and made you the king?
We don't know what we want, but we know that we want it
Yeah, we want it, yeah, we want it right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
(Fuck you) Everybody, everybody's full of

Sugar, honey, ice, and tea (Oh, and now everybody's full of)
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea (Every, every, everybody full of)
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea (Oh, everybody's full of)
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
