Sometimes I wonder why are we all here
Call me a nihilist, I guess I'm just unclear
To why I bother, why I try
Death is on my mind so much, it makes me wanna die
I lost my wife this year, we've lost our friend
Always fighting battles, but it never seem to end
Are we just ladders in the world of snakes?
'Cause if life's one big fuckin' game, well, I don't wanna play
So come and sing me, sing me to sleep
I dealt with too much fuckin' shit and now I'm in too deep
Cut off my wings, my flowers bloomed
You want salvation? Well, I'm sorry, we're all doomed

Cut off my wings and come lock me up
Just pull the plug, yeah, I've had enough
Tear me to pieces, sell me for parts
You're all vampires, so here

You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my
You might also like
The world's a funeral, a room of ghosts
No hint of movement, no sign of pulse
Only an echo, just skin and bone
They kicked the chair, but we
We helped tie the rope

You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my heart (My heart, heart)
You can have my

So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade

I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed, and now, there's no way back

You must've made some kind of mistake
I asked for death, but instead, I'm awake
The Devil told me, "No room for cheats"
I thought I'd sold my soul, but he kept the receipt
So leave a light on, I'm coming home
It's getting darker, but I'll carry on
The sun don't shine but it never did
And when it rains, it fuckin' pours, but I think I like it
And you know that I'm in love with the mess, I think I like it

So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade

I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed, and now, there's no way back
I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed, and now, there's no way back

So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry, but it's too late, and it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade

I think we're doomed
I think we're doomed, and now, there's no way back
