Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

On the verge of no return, why'd you keep fucking it up?
Don't wanna have to bury you, but nothing seems to get through your skull
One day, the only butterflies left will be in your chest
As you march towards your death, breathing your last breath
I hate to say "I told you so," but look how the bruises show

Tell me, how's it gonna feel
Without my arms wrapped around, wrapped around you?
Bet it feels pretty real when your skin starts to peel from the bone
You were dead to the world, now I'm dead to you
Haunting your own house, nothing to lose
How did I let you sink your fangs so deep? Ah-ah
You know you can't breathe on your own

Past the point of rescuing, why'd I keep pushing my luck?
The hole I wore into your soul has got too big to overlook
One day, the only butterflies left will be in our chests
As we march towards our death, breathing our last breath
I thought we had a future, but we ain't got a chance in hell
You might also like
So tell me, how's it gonna feel without my arms
Wrapped around, wrapped around you?
Bet it feels pretty real when your skin starts to peel from the bone
You were dead to the world, now I'm dead to you
Haunting your own house, nothing to lose
I let you sink your fangs so deep, ah-ah
You know you can't breathe on your own
You know I can't breathe on my own
How can you breathe on your own?
How can I breathe on my own?

Oh, oh-oh-oh

The sun is setting on our love, I fear
Letting our loneliness out into the atmosphere
The tide is turning on our chance to turn it 'round (Love isn't in the air, love isn't in the air)
I never thought I'd see my fingernails fall out (Love isn't in the air, love isn't in the air)
Love isn't in the air, love isn't in the air
