I've been climbing up the walls to escape the sinking feeling
But I can't hide from the nihilist at my door
Buried in the basement floor, didn't know what I had planted
It blossomed with all the heart of a Cold War

I'm a spirit in a tomb
Won't somebody raise the roof?
I'm going white, I'm going black, I'm going blue
Do you mind if I'm exhumed?
I'm the ashes in the plume
I'm a beggar in the ruin
I'm peaking out, I'm burning up, I'm shooting through
I'm only lonely for the truth

Paradise is in my soul, and I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth, we are lost in a labyrinth
Paradise is in my soul, and I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth, we are lost in a labyrinth
Please, don't follow
Paradise is in my soul, and I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth, we are lost in a labyrinth
Please, don't follow

Light as a feather, stiff as a board
Sink to the floor, I sink to the floor
I sink to the floor
Light as a feather, stiff as a board
You were in my dream last night, but your face was someone else's
A twitch in my spine, a mutual disorder
Isolation neophyte, too afraid to taste your conscience
You march in the dark, little lamb to the slaughter

I'm a spirit in a tomb
Won't somebody raise the roof?
I'm going white, I'm going black, I'm going blue
Do you mind if I'm exhumed?
I'm the ashes in the plume
I'm a beggar in the ruin
I'm peaking out, I'm burning up, I'm shooting through
I'm only lonely for the truth

Paradise is in my soul, and I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth, we are lost in a labyrinth
Please, don't follow
Paradise is in my soul, and I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth, we are lost in a labyrinth
