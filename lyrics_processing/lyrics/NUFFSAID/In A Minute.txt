I ain't spit a bar in a minute
Shit...

Shit...
I ain't spit a bar in a minute (In a minute)
I ain't spit the AR in a minute (In a minute)
I ain't been to the bar in a minute (In a minute)
Shit, I ain't drove my own car in a minute (In a minute)

Play the backseat lately, chauffeured
Pull up to the club with yo girl
Yeah you know I hit that pussy
Till I made that ho purr (Yeah)
And my pockets stay fat
They be on Oprah (Unh huh)
I'm tryna cop that new 7
Or the Range Rover (Yeah)
I'm tryna make it in heaven
But I'm never sober (Never)
College hoes on deck
Finna call 'em over (Yeah)
White girl, fat ass
Anna Kournikova
Don't get me wrong
I love chocolate girls (Right)
Like Russell Stover's
Tryna put on for my city
Like that nigga Hova (Yeah)
I'm from that lead fly Bedstuy
Strong live, rest die
Live around the corner
From Bedford, Nostrand
Finna milk the game
Even tho a nigga lactose (Unh huh)
Let's toast
We in the building
Like asbestos
Yeah you gettin' money
But that don't mean you the best though (Nah)
Heart and soul
Is what you other rappin' niggas lack most
You might also like(x2)

I be with a gang of wolf
Like my last name Mozart
My life like a movie
Only got a couple co-stars (Yeah)
All the real homies
That been fucking with me
From the start (Unh huh)
Pull up like blood clart
Where the fucking weed at
A&R's looking for the best
Nigga we that
My team run this shit
Like a motherfucking MEAC (Right)
Got a potty mouth
Please excuse my French
My team only got shooters
Please excuse my bench
Leaving all my regrets
In my rear view lens
Life is like a camping trip
That shit's intense
Bunch of two faced friends
Call em Harvey Dent's
Bout to head to the church
Kneel down and repent
(x2)
Lord
Please bless me (Bless him)
Cuz every day a fuck boy
Wanna test me
