Yeah
To all my killers and the hunnid dollar billers
Word up son
To real niggas who ain't got no feelin's
Check it out now

I'm like a colorblind
Optimus Prime
Going Columbine
Armed with the sword of Omen
Totin'
Virginia Tech nines
Got the twenty foot, three-headed hydra
For small intestines
Got my pen and pad ready
For any nigga
Who wanna test mine?
From that Boo-doo-bye-bye Bedstuy
Where the young boy
Let the lead fly
Where the strong live
And the rest die
Egos don't match
They chest size
Evil will
Get you chastised
Bum nigga
You don't get fly
Price tags on me
Like Best Buy
All my verses is deadstock
Just like my kicks is
I be kickin' it up in the kitchen
Takin' aim with fixed precision
See my dreams all take fruition
Hope these ignoramus listen
I am hip hop's new addition
Homies tell me cool it now
They probably fans o' New Edition
From the dead I have arisen
Seen the white light through the prism
Free my brother that's in prison
Hope he come back out with wisdom
Man I swear to God I miss him
But a nigga on a mission
All these haters slick dissin'
Cuz a nigga Slick Rickin'
Get yo hand up!
You might also like (x4)
This the sound o' one hand clappin
I call that shit Han Solo

Genius
Tell me what the business is
Since 2010
Me and NUFF$AID been killin' shit
Mobbin' like we from the Bridge
Control the game with a verse
I'm feelin' like Kendrick
For everything I write
I'm facin' twenty-five to life
I'm blowin' by twenty-five
I put that on my life
Southpaw nigga
I don't really do what's right
What good your Margiela's
If they never seen my Mike's?
Yes I be genius
But I'm more like a savage
I'm not from 8 Mile
But I feel like B-Rabbit
It's only right
I cause these niggas havoc
I'm schoolin' these rappers
They soundin' D average
Gotta clap 'em for me by the hook
Rebel nigga never played by the book
Only one real reason why they shook
Cuz ain't no such thing as halfway crooks


Hatin' on God-given talent
So blasphemy is what it has to be
Claim they ready for war
But ain't ready for all the casualties
Mixtape ain't even done
They already call it a masterpiece
Make me wanna lick a shot at the Sun
My nigga pass the piece
Poppa been smooth since days o' Underoos
Got this Hip-Hop shit down packed like kangaroos
Girlfriend, here's a pen
I'ma Facebook, IG ya
Come through
Have sex on rugs
That's IKEA
Tell a stripper bitch chill
Go head hit your tip drill
Cuz if that booty sit still
Them dollar bill won't spill
When last you heard another rapper
With this much skill?
I only run from holy water
If the shit distilled
My flow sick, sick, sick
Not six, six, six
Rep my city
Like my New York
State ID
I'm the NUFF
Dollar sign
To the A-I-D
And if I wasn't
Then why would I say I be?
Get yo hand up!
