'Cause I'm in love with your back, in love with your back
But if you just got to turn around
I really hope your face match, hope your face match
'Cause girl I'm in love wit yo booty, in love wit yo booty
In love wit yo booty, in love wit yo booty
In love wit yo booty, in love wit yo booty
Girl, I'm so deeply in love wit yo booty
Momma got ass for day's
And she got a daughter about half her age
I conversate with her from the rear
Her booty talking shit I wanna hear
So I'ma have to lend it my ear for a second
My girl right here getting pissed, trying to smack me
And I'ma have to blame it on a fifth like a alchy
But on the way home, I be reminiscing on this song
Girl, don't turn around
'Cause I'm in love with your back, in love with your back
But if you just got to turn around
I really hope your face match, hope your face match
'Cause girl I'm in love wit yo booty, in love wit yo booty
In love wit yo booty, in love wit yo booty
In love wit yo booty, in love wit yo booty
Girl, I'm so deeply in love wit yo booty
You might also likeIf I could, then I would put a ring on it
But since I can't, you should let me put my thang on it
'Cause I'll lick it like a stamp and make it rain on me
And mail you back to your man with my name on it
So I'ma have to lend it my ear for a second
My girl right here getting pissed, trying to smack me
And I'ma have to blame it on a fifth like a alchy
But on the way home, I be reminiscing on this song
Girl, don't turn around
'Cause I'm in love with your back, in love with your back
But if you just got to turn around
I really hope your face match, hope your face match
'Cause girl I'm in love wit yo booty, in love wit yo booty
In love wit yo booty, in love wit yo booty
In love wit yo booty, in love wit yo booty
Girl, I'm so deeply in love wit yo booty
Now let me see you get your Reggae dance on
I like the way the booty rollin' to my song
Girl, you got me up, you feel it threw my clothes
Wanna lay you up and take you to the home
That girl just rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
Bring it back to the top, don't stop
Girl, don't turn around
'Cause I'm in love with your back, in love with your back
But if you just got to turn around
I really hope your face match, hope your face match
'Cause girl I'm in love wit yo booty, in love wit yo booty
In love wit yo booty, in love wit yo booty
In love wit yo booty, in love wit yo booty
Girl, I'm so deeply in love wit yo booty
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go
So I'ma have to lend it my ear for a second
My girl right here getting pissed, trying to smack me
And I'ma have to blame it on a fifth like a alchy
