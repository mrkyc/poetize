And see my mind, body and soul feel magnetized
They are one with each other, I keep attracting light
I'm on the right track when I rap, I'm passing satelites
And spreading food for thought to rappers with an appetite
Steve jobs was the apple of my eye
I'm an asshole with afro who just likes tobacco pipes
But now I''m about to travel in the sky
I quit alcohol for drugs and now I'm high and dry
So it's back to the jack daniels any time i like
Meditation, I'm losing my mind at night
And when I wake up, I find it right by the mic
They criticize nikolai because I'm getting high
So ask my drummer what I symbolize
I meet people 20 times before I know them
I close my eyes and i don't know where I'm going
Tomorrow is coming right now
That was zen, this is tao
See me friends, see the tension in the clouds
I hope you know what im about be attentive
Imagine driving an aston martin through wine country
Northern california is really quite sunny
My money is chun li's pig tails, split in two
There's some for me and there's some for you
I'm feeling like jordan so you might as well light that J
Hide behind the black shade and lie back blazed
My white girl has furry boots and nice ass ways
Peppermint kiss and a leopard print ipad case
She's gets high and plays words with friends
It always ends up in a tournament
I never learn from it
I might never find nirvana but ima still search for it
Infatuated with being perfect im nervous
Affirmative, burning the herbalness down, I'm down
Green eyes but I promise you kermit did it
Sunshine blotter paper if you need a party
Call me when your ready to leave your body
You might also likeTomorrow is coming right now
That was zen, this is tao
See me friends, see the tension in the clouds
