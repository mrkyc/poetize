There's a summer
A frozen heart recalls
When you're breathing with love
There's a pathway
The silver candle shines
When you're seeing with love

Dry martini with a smoking jacket
When I die I hope you smoke my ashes
See which of my friends can proudly roll it the fastest
Will it be Ricky, Riley, Freddie, Tony, Joe, Harry, or Memphis? (which one?)
Arrogance and self-awareness never go hand-in-hand
Charm is my specialty, styling's my plan
I want to win an Aston Martin in the poker game
Trying to work for MI6 and my word is bond like James
The rest of the competition's on novocaine
Easy, small, and expensive watches living like mobsters
I put a bomb under my car and drive it off a cliff
And while I blow up, I write the most fire shit
So I can tell god I went out in a blaze of glory
Bring them a paper full of kush and tell them blaze it for me
Writing verses stuffing purple in by Bible page
Now it's me and Moses surfing on a tidal wave

No words, no expectation, no hate, no problems (x2)

Hallucinating in the snow storm
Avalanche cannabis slow burn
I got a thermal full of Merlot
Drinking wine in the cold
It's great for the body
It's good for the mind and the soul
Ski slope building a mountain full of coke
And a house of cards that resembles a happy home
It's coming down on my faux
I need an ounce of hope, or half
Kilo of humor and two pounds of jokes
Pimping I moved out my mom's house
Now I'm feeling homesick
Cause my insecurities is what I'm left alone with
Hip hop I'm your old man
Oh man, we're old friends
Let's get potted tell all the rappers kick rocks like Stonehenge
Tchaikovsky choke pen
I'm cocky I go in
And then like opium
All known associates
Rolling pimp blunts in the tube like Fallopian
