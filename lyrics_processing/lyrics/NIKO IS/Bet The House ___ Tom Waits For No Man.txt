Beat killer made another murder victim
My dawg got stopped by the cops he had the burner wit him
Serial number scratched off, it's a dirty business
Meanwhile meet Mao, that's my work assistant
Anyways I'm Prince of Zamunda with 30 bitches
No top on the drop call it circumcision
I see straight through the bullshit, I got perfect vision
I'm in Serie A you in third division
I got the German wit me like Jurgen Klinsmann
I'm the playmaker go focus on your position
This is urban diction I murder the words I ain't a perfect Christian
I'm smoking herb in Lisbon with Turkish women
Outside of the box like Churches Chicken
Homie ever doubting me was your worst decision
Everything purple rest in peace to Big Moe
Bia Bia playing bitches gon' get low
Bitch I'm feeling so invincible, twisting info
Everybody round me some blessed individuals
Everybody round me gettin' doe
Tell women surround me with the gold
Brutus!
Bet the house on me
I'm going all in it
Doing something new, they don't even know what they callin' it
You might also likeI been bad with the pen and pad bitch I'm Sinbad when I'm in the lab
It's a different world cinemax flow
In the castle out in Trinidad
But Leningrad is my winter swag though
Linen rag coat looking like a diplomat
There's so many ways to skin a cat though
Tell Smallz spin the wax, I'ma chill and hit the wax
Brazilian rap I invented that flow
Kicking back, sippin' that fo in the back of the Lac pickin' that fro
I'm the 2060 Nat Cole
The second verse is even harder than the first
Verses are permanent, magic markers on his shirt
So pardon the jargon I'm at a loss for words
It's a King's speech like Colin Firth
I'm a martyr you get lost int he verse
Bitch I'm feeling so invincible, twisting info
Everybody round me some blessed individuals
Everybody round me gettin' doe
Tell women surround me with the gold
Brutus!
Bet the house on me
I'm going all in it
Doing something new, they don't even know what they callin' it

Tom waits for no man so no can do
I sky rocket in the purple clouds and so can you
In my pocket lies a Roman crown that's gold and blue
It's so big you couldn't hold it with both hands (true)
Since the devil needs a song that he can slow dance to
Joey's on the MPC making old man's blues
I'm the Sultan of the Fontainebleau
When I move to Cancun I make sure to bring the whole fam through
We can eat carne esada and just roll bambu
I got the curls of God I use gold shampoo
We the no canned food crew we crab rangoo
I know ya dig, been in the crib like Roseanne do
Leave me alone man, I'm grown man dude, I'm Conan dude
Yo man you really stand no chance dude
Dan dun play the roland dude it's so damn smooth
