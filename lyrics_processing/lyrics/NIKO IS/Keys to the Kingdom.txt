Don't fuck with media hype
Cookin' in the stew
Ya'll got the ingredients right
Fly as ?
Trippin' like an Expedia flight
Man I might have been the king of Brazil in a previous life
And the ? like meteorite
Make it ? smokers livin' tedious lives
I'm helium high
My Ma gave me the keys to the kingdom
And told me keep it G
Now the heart colder than feet of a penguin
In the backseat of a Lincoln
Just chiefin' an ism
Just thinkin' peace in religion
We don't even need a religion
We just need us
Don't come and live the dream we invented
I mean, let a boy lay on the grave like a gremlin
I need a pack of dutch masters and a B.I.G beat
And then I be coughin' like I D.I.E.D
Look C.I.B, V.I.P. mami ven aqui
Got some ? from Cali
And some Bourbon from Tennessee
You might also like
We could kick soccer on the beach
Throw on that Big Poppa on repeat
Light a blunt
In the name of the O.G's

(O.G. shit... O.G...)
A pack of dutch masters
And a B.I.G beat
And then I get to coughin'
Like I D.I.E.D

Look nephew, it's best you know
This is that Navy SEAL rescue flow
John the Baptist, God bless you flow
You're making a mess, Ima let you gooo
I got lightning reflexes you're a step too slow (AH!)
Stop trippin' you nervous and I know it
I see the checkin' of the watch I notice the eye rollin'
Desperation creeps into the room like fog
And you get immersed in it (?)
By the 3rd minute you now thinkin' bout the 4th
Of course it's five course dinners we drink until the models gone
Eventually I wobble home and just follow the cobblestone
I had to stop for an espresso and a waffle cone
Weigh myself look tape myself like Karl Malone look
Eyo breakfast is plaintain chips and champagne sips
This is real rap raw, boy you can't change this
The wizard Joe is in the cor, Now I'm Frieda in the door (?)
Bout to give it and go, Julius Irving finger roll
