Real dogs bite hard and bark light
Bourbon balls in my archive
My flow game like shark bites
My mind writes at Mach 5
I spark lye dutchies
I split like apartheid
Tia and Tamara now I'm feeling like Smart Guy
Red carpet life
We stay in the star bright
He got the hands high now that I'm playing my cards right and get dealt with
I embellish in the selfish on my Finelle shit
I'm bumping Children of the Corn on my Big L shit
It's going to be a training day until I'm Denzel rich
Ayo my swag is crippled rap is badder than this
I rap elaborate extravagance, I'm the Gatsby of wit
If I ain't in your top five then I'm snatching your list
Bitch, I came to fuck up the track like a scratch of the disc, ha!
Let's keep it moving, man, it's Colours of the Culture
Welcome to the motherfucking organization
I'm the rapper with clout everybody yap about
You talk dirty about Colours and Danny will snatch your mouth
Without a doubt give you something to write about
I spit the gospel straight out of the shaman's mouth
The time is now
I'm high as my grandmama smiling down at the afro shining Prada inside the Chevy riding round
The body never understands just what the mind's about
It probably ends up usually finding itself inside the clouds
I'm feeling righteous I might just put on King Midas's crown and crack the golden whip on my lions if I hear the slightest sound
I'm bringing the virus out
Spitting the typhus now
Pendulum swinging like 
When the money starts coming and the eyes come out
They start looking at your from every single angle
You feel strangled but I stay INCOGNIKO I did 
You might also likeWhat in the world should I rhyme about, whatever, I'm around
Fuck haters, I got them open like Miley Cyrus's mouth
Oh Lord!
I'm the rapper with clout everybody yap about
You talk dirty about Colours and Danny will slap your mouth
I'm the rapper with clout everybody yap about
You talk dirty about Joey then Chico will slap your mouth
I got that lift I'm like an elevator
Listening to Ella
The emerald excavator
Energy detonator
We talking back and forth like FBI investigators
Feng shui living, the interior decorator
Fuck the speculators and suspects
They constantly keep getting in the way of my success
Crazy enough to make lady luck undress and talk Mother Nature out of her sundress
I got that lift and I riff with the risk-takers
The bump mix and I puff spliffs with the dick-takers
Articulate disc-makers
