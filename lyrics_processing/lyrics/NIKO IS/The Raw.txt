The optimist botanist
If hip hop is too monotonous
Then I look pompous in the drop top bumping 2Pacalypse
Blunted and provocative
Family running the block with this
Fucking the world so much it's preposterous to be monogamous

On that pineapple tie lifted, I feel like Socrates
Drinking guava tea, talking transcendental philosophies
Spazzing, laughing at mediocrity
I hit the smoke and like Lord of the Rings, the trees talk to me

Ooh baby, I like the raw

I put my mink on, it's such a fucking cold world
Never trust a woman with too many homegirls
They talk shit and throw luggage
They start shit, then end shit, then gossip and hold grudges
I just puff dutches in my cave, I'm a hermit
Rappers just digging an early grave
Bring the hearses, performing at the pearly gates, this is ya funeral service
I'm a beautiful person
I speak sermons from the Home of the Brave
You'll see somebody's true colors with a chrome in their face
I'm stoned and amazed at the amount of clones in the game, that don't amount to the gold in my chain, there's no fucking way
I'm on a whole different plane
I'm flying over the game
I'm 300, no one's allowed to bowl in my lane
Homie is so frozen in flames I was chosen to reign, bitch I smoke the pain away until it goes to the brain

I'm on the coast of Costa Rica, just to sow wild oats
Straight plotting like oh I know
Driving scooters on the beach, I got both eyes closed
I get doper with the more I smoke
The flow I wrote is dope sorta like the coca boat
Dutch master can't slow my roll
I cop reefer from a Russian shop keeper
Although it's not cheaper than the Puerto Ricans, it's more convenient
Ayo, the corner is my corner office
We discuss important topics like exporting narcotics to get more of a profit
I want your ears, your heart or something, it's charming
The water gets deeper where the sharks swim
I put tentacles everywhere, I'm eating octopus
Ayo, we don't fuck with your shit that shit don't knock enough, oh yeah
I just got me like a box of blunts and some chocolate truffles
I got what ya want
Boy I got ya open
