OG
Ay yo man Joey
Tito crack that dutch
Tito crack that dutch
Roll the window down
Inhale and ash the blunt
That's that Girl Scout cookies
Sour Diesel, Captain Crunch
Get the cash stack it up
Then fall back and add it up
Tito crack that dutch
Tito crack that dutch

(We love it!)
Bang!

Blunted with the plug I'm blunted in the club I'm in
So high on the success it comes off as humbling
Come again, all my bitches come again
And its colors of the culture
Just in case you're wondering
Goose got me just like Zeus
Coming through thundering
Hovering over the competition that keeps tumbling
The industry is suffering
I don't fuck with none of them (nah)
As soon as I touched the pen
I'm in Wonderland
Down the rabbit hole
Tryna go wherever Alice goes
Jack, I'm sippin' Captain while I'm trapping with the calico
Just to pay the rent like Alamo
Pyrex flow, Virgil Abloh
Fass the po, Joe pass the dro
I don't fuck with negative people, we're not compatible
I don't understand hating on others, that's irrational
The truth in the booth and the proof is all factual
Yo NIKO IS the name make sure all them words is capital!

COLOURS

Salute me and suit me quick
I'm Kuti with the doobie lit
In the Stu', that's a movie script
High as a Bruce Lee kick
I'm ordering Sushi at Suzie, Julie her booty's great
And Juicy's woozy off the booze he sip, he's a lightweight
I dig a groovy chick, eyes blue, yeah, that's Tookie Crip
With a booty as juicy as Lucy Liu's lips, look
Stu brought the crew for a Q, call that Judy Dench
That's when we learn family ain't always friends
Carpe diem, if I seem 'em, it's all love
You learn to leave things in the past
Keep on speeding in a BM, I just laugh
With an Eastern European who's agreeing with the facts
Hearts get taken like Liam, then we leave 'em in the trash
Boy I Beez up in the trap, break my trees up and relax
I'm so G'd up got my feet up on the track
Almas Caviar for the first course
It's so well deserved cause I'm a workhorse
Tito crack that dutch
Tito crack that dutch
Roll the window down
Inhale and ash the blunt
That's that Girl Scout cookie
Sour Diesel, Captain Crunch
Get the cash, stack it up
Then fall back and add it up
