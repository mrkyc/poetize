Ayo the record is rugged, so we deserve an incredible budget
If not then it's an errant judgement
But they need something disposable they could sell to the public
Go and have your self destructed boy, America loves it (They love that shit)
I'm not shooting for heaven, I'm shooting for a level above it
The way is too  in the sky for the devil to touch it
I need a box of leaf dutches and Moet in a bucket
The concierge pullin' strings like the neck of a puppet
In the face of death, I practice the sacred breath
And live life by the thought, never waste a sec
Boy I twist fire then I spark, and get right
The kid writes in the dark
It's midnight, I'm like a fistfight in the park
He gets right with a quick right, it feels like a big knife to heart
Yo there's a thin line between war
If you don't see the lucidity you should probably dream more

Natural born chillers, Mallory ridin' shotgun
Don't worry 'bout the tropical mama I got some
Six course meals we got options
I just want you to be who you are when nobody is watching
Nobody is watching
I want you to be who you are when nobody is watching
Be real or be aware where you going
Make sure the  is flowing

In a age where satisfaction's instantaneous, people get impatient being patient
Everybody's high maintenance
Everybody wants to be in five places at the same time without wasting time like 
Bring the cash in
Make sure that your seat belt is fastened
Fast and frugal with the hash she likes to ration (That's true)
I like to splurge that's my fashion
I got the flashing  full of passion
I got that (Hell yeah) I got that (Yeah )
I make that sincere, I been here
Air 1's, give me ten pairs
Enjoy the fruits of labor I need ten pears
I smoke pot and I rise (Rise)
And use telescope eyes to see the robots in the skies
The world's spinning in reverse
I'm just living in the verse
Linen livin' got me feelin' like I'm sinnin' in the church
The unlimited lyricist boy I'm bringin' you that work
For my gravediggers that are swimmin' in the dirt
I roll a swisher full of purp (Cheers)

Don't worry 'bout the tropical pa cause I got some

Nobody is watching
I want you to be who you are when nobody is watching
