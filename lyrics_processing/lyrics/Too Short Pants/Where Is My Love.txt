Hey baby, what's up?
Um, just sitting at the studio makin some music right now
Well, I mean it's my dream, I think if I work hard enough
It'll take off at some point
You mean that guy from the bar? What about him?
Oh...
Well if he makes you happy I guess I won't keep you from that
What do you expect me to say?
It seems like you've already made up your mind
So what's the point in trying?
If I don't make you happy I want you to be with somebody who does
Somethin's just not right with me
I'm never who I'm supposed to be
I never can find what I seek
All of me is broken
Somethin' in my life's missin'
I couldn't even begin
To explain to you what I'm feelin'
It's somethin' unspoken
Where is my love? I don't know
I thought I gave it to the girl with the halo
It doesn't matter what you do
I'll never come back home to you
I had to saay goodbye to you
There was nothin' else I could do
Cause when I tried to make a move
You gave me the cold shoulder
I don't think this is a sin
Maybe I can try again
If you have to ask me when
My answer is when I'm older
Where is my love? I don't know
I thought I gave it to the girl with the halo
It doesn't matter what you do
I'll never come back home to you
Look, I'm not mad
I just... I'm a little disappointed
I thought that you were the one
But I guess you didn't feel the same way
And if you want we can be friends
But I understand if you don't want that either
I guess it's hard enough for you to be in a relationship with me so
Feel free to block me I guess
On everything
I'm used to it, I'll be okay
Not that you care
Where is my love? I don't know
I thought I gave it to the girl with the halo
It doesn't matter what you do
I'll never come back home to you
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
