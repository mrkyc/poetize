You think that I would miss you after everything you did
You think that I would listen to you cause I loved your kid
You think that I'll forget about when you mistreated me
You think that I'd forget about the times you'd scream until we'd bleed

You told me you would never leave
Told me I wouldn't have to grieve
That there'd be no more suffering
You told me all these beautiful lies
Dragged me through your screwed up life
Didn't care how it affected me
Every time something pretty looked your way
You dropped me like an old toupee
And then expected me to return
You just make me so damn angry
With the way you treated me
I meant less to you than dirt

You think that I'd forget all the times that we broke up
You think that I'd forgive you for those men you went and fucked
You think that I'd forget all of the times I felt unsafe
The times I had to wrestle knives out of your hands and face
You might also like
You lied to me you told me everything would be okay
But when I wasn't there you had another dick in your face
Youre gonna lose your fucking kid because you can't quit weed
But that's not surprising cause its more important to you than anything

You told me you would never leave
Told me I wouldn't have to grieve
That there'd be no more suffering
You told me all these beautiful lies
Dragged me through your screwed up life
Didn't care how it affected me
Every time something pretty looked your way
You dropped me like an old toupee
And then expected me to return
You just make me so damn angry
With the way you treated me
