When I think about life
And the way that itd be if you were not with me
When i think about you
And I think about me and how we fight so easily
How I get when I don't get hugs
When I'm not on drugs when I don't get love
How you get when I say things wrong
When I talk too long when I sing my songs

I can't let go of you and thats okay
Because you can't let go of me and so ill say
That its true
I love you
And the things
That you do baby
I'm addicted to you

When I think about him
And the things he did and the way you dont care about it
When I think about me
And the things that I see and the things that you dont believe
How you get when I make you mad
Try to call my dad call me something bad
How i get when you dont say hi
When you say goodbye when you tell me lies
You might also like
I can't let go of you and thats okay
Because you can't let go of me and so ill say
That its true
I love you
And the things
That you do baby
I'm addicted to you

When I think about us
And the way that we were when we still lived together
When I think about you
And the way that you'll be when youre with someone other than me
How I get when you move along
Tell me nothings wrong then you say im strong
How you get when you think I'll leave
Say its your pet peeve you dpmnt wanna grieve

I can't let go of you and thats okay
Because you can't let go of me and so ill say
That its true
I love you
And the things
That you do baby
