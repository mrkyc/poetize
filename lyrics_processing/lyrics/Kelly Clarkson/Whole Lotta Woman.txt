What you say?
(Girl, this my body)

You ain't know? Texas women do it bigger
(What? Say it ain't so)
In the south, it gets no realer, baby
Pot full of grits, I'm hotter than your mama's supper, boy
Better get with it
Better watch your mouth, I might burn you, boy
You go, uh, downtown, gonna work
Good Lord like dessert
If ya scared, go to church
Woo, woo, on alert
Hold on tight, little country boy
I ain't no girl, I'm a boss with orders
All I'm needin' is a baby to love me
Like a warm biscuit on a Sunday mornin'

I got what you want, I'm aimin' to please
I got what it takes, I sure got the means
I got what you want
Sugar, honey, iced tea
All eyes on me, oh, oh, baby
You might also like
I'm a whole lotta woman
(From the way I walk and toss my hips)
I'm a whole lotta woman
(From the sound of my voice to the gloss on my lips)
I'm a whole lotta woman
(Anything I see, I want, I get)
I'm a strong, bad-ass chick with classic confidence, yeah

One time for the green
And rollin' like Tina
Lovin' hard ain't easy
Woo, woo, if ya mean it
Hold on tight, little country boy
I ain't no girl, I'm a boss with orders
All I'm needin' is a baby to love me
Like a warm biscuit on a Sunday mornin'

I got what you want, I'm aimin' to please
I got what it takes, I sure got the means
I got what you want
Sugar, honey, iced tea
All eyes on me, oh, oh, baby
I'm a whole lotta woman
(From the way I walk and toss my hips)
I said, I'm a whole lotta woman
(From the sound of my voice to the gloss on my lips)
I'm a whole lotta woman
(Anything I see, I want, I get)
I'm a strong, bad-ass chick with classic confidence, hey

Ain't no competition, babe
It's just can you keep up with me?
I can't do a thing about my wicked ways with gravity
Higher than the leaves, they fall from trees like D-O-Double G's
I reside in Tennessee, but Texas still flows deep in me

I'm a whole lotta woman
(From the way I walk and toss my hips)
Hey, I'm a whole lotta woman
(From the sound of my voice to the gloss on my lips)
I said, I'm a whole lotta woman
(Anything I see I want, I get)
I'm a strong, bad-ass chick with classic confidence, hey

Come on!
