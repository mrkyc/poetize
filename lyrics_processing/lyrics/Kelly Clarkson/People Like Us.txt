We come into this world unknown
But know that we are not alone
They try and knock us down
But change is coming, it's our time now

Hey, everybody loses it
Everybody wants to throw it all away sometimes
And hey, yeah, I know what you're going through
Don't let it get the best of you, you'll make it out alive
Oh

People like us, we've gotta stick together
Keep your head up, nothing lasts forever
Here's to the damned, to the lost and forgotten
It's hard to get high when you're living on the bottom

Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
We are all misfits living in a world on fire
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Sing it for the people like us, the people like us

Hey, this is not a funeral
It's a revolution after all your tears have turned to rage
Just wait, everything will be okay
Even when you're feeling like it's going down in flames
Oh
You might also like
People like us, we've gotta stick together
Keep your head up, nothing lasts forever
Here's to the damned, to the lost and forgotten
It's hard to get high when you're living on the bottom

Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
We are all misfits living in a world on fire
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Sing it for the people like us, the people like us
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
You've just gotta turn it up loud when the flames get higher
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Sing it for the people like us, the people like us

They can't do nothing to you, they can't do nothing to me
This is the life that we choose, this is the life that we bleed
So throw your fists in the air
Come out, come out if you dare
Tonight we're gonna change forever

Everybody loses it
Everybody wants to throw it all away sometimes
Oh
People like us, we've gotta stick together
Keep your head up, nothing lasts forever
Here's to the damned, to the lost and forgotten
It's hard to get high when you're living on the bottom

Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
We are all misfits living in a world on fire (In a world on fire)
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Sing it for the people like us, the people like us
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
You've just gotta turn it up loud when the flames get higher
(When the flames get higher)
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Sing it for the people like us, the people like us
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
We are all misfits living in a world on fire
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Sing it for the people like us, the people like us

Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
You've just gotta turn it up loud when the flames get higher
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
