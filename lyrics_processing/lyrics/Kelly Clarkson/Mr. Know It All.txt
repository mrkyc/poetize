Mr. Know-It-All
Well, ya, you think you know it all
But ya don't know a thing at all
Ain't it, ain't it something, y'all?
When somebody tells you something 'bout you
Think that they know you more than you do
So ya take it down, another pill to swallow

Mr. Bring-Me-Down
Well, ya, ya like to bring me down
Don't ya? But I ain't layin' down
Baby, I ain't goin' down

That's why I'm leavin' you lonely, lonely
'Cause, baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me
You ain't got the right to tell me
When and where to go, no right to tell me
Actin' like you own me lately
Yeah, baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me
