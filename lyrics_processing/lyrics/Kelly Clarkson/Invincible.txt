You know I was broke down, I had hit the ground
I was crying out, couldn't make no sound
No one hears the silent tears collecting
You know I had lost hope, I was all alone
Never been so low 'til you came along
Teacher, I feel the dots connecting

Beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
'Cause I can take on so much more than I had ever dreamed
So beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
'Cause baby, I am ready to be free
Now I am invincible
No, I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah, I am invincible
What was I running for? (Oh)
I was hiding from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible
And I'm a perfect storm (Oh)

Now I am a warrior, a shooting star
You know I got this far, had a broken heart
No one hears the silent tears collecting
'Cause it's being weak, that's strong
In the truth, I'm found
I have courage now, gonna shout it out
Teacher, I feel the dots connecting

Beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
'Cause I can take on so much more than I had ever dreamed
So beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
'Cause baby, I am ready to be free (Yeah, yeah)
Now I am invincible
No, I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah, I am invincible
What was I running for? (Oh)
I was hiding from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible
And I'm a perfect storm

I was running from an empty threat
Of emptiness
I was running from an empty threat
That didn't exist
I was running from an empty threat
Of abandonment
I was running from an empty threat
That didn't exist
But now I am invincible
No, I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah, I am invincible
What was I running for?
I was hiding from the world (Ooh)
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure (Ooh)
Now I am invincible
And I'm a perfect storm (Ooh, oh)
Now I am invincible (Ooh)
No, I ain't a scared little girl no more (Ooh)
Yeah, I am invincible (Ooh)
What was I running for? (What was I running for?)
I was hiding from the world
I was so afraid, I was so unsure (I was so unsure)
Now I am invincible (Oh)
