You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

Tonight (Tonight), I'm gonna hold you close (Ooh)
Make sure that you know (Know)
I was lost before you (Ooh)
Christmas was cold and grey (Ooh)
Another holiday (So alone)
Alone to celebrate

But then (But then), one day (One day)
Everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree
You might also like
I found (I found) what I was looking for (Ooh)
A love that's meant for me (Me)
A heart that's mine completely (Ooh)
Knocked me right off my feet (Ooh)
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all

'Cause you ('Cause you) are near (Are near)
And everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

And then, one day, everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree, yeah

You're here where you should be (Oh yeah)
Snow is falling as the carolers sing (Oh, yeah, yeah)
It just wasn't the same (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight (Oh, you're all I need)
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight (Underneath my tree)
You're all that I need (Underneath my tree, yeah)
Underneath the tree, tonight

Oh, you're all I need
