I need a do-over, how did we end up this way?
I'm so confused, lover, did I mistake love and pain?
Ain't got no shine left, I couldn't hide it
I almost lost all my light, and
I didn't choose sober, but my eyes can't look away
I see our true colors, lately, we've been lookin' gray
I can't turn back now 'cause you'd take me back down
That road that always seems to come right back around

Remember when
We had dreams to fly away?
But that was then
And now our story's just a page

Like a wave, you're always crashin' into me, crashin' into me
And these days are harder than they used to be, and they used to be
No shootin' stars can fix what we aren't, and
What good's a lighthouse when the light is burnin' out?

It's such a shame when your wants and needs, they don't align
Which road to take? 'Cause your hand's no longer holdin' mine
I guess that's life, and sometimes you fight, and
Sometimes you walk away in order to survive
You might also like
Remember when
There was nowhere to throw blame?
But that was then
And now it's when you use my name

Like a chill in my bones when you say to me what you say to me
I thought I found home, but hidden underneath, we were crumblin'
No shootin' stars can fix what we aren't, and
What good's a lighthouse when the light is burnin' out?

And I feel what we were washing over me (I feel)
Questioning everything all the time
And I keep all the ways that you wanted me (I keep)
To be different fresh in my mind (Fresh in my mind)
What you loved, what you wanted, what you held (Ooh)
So high when we first met in hindsight
Were the things that you tried and asked me to change
As if I could do that

Like a wave, you're always crashin' into me, crashin' into me
And these days are harder than they used to be, and they used to be
No shootin' stars can fix what we aren't, and
