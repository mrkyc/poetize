You were my Rock Hudson
It was real, but it wasn't
No, I never saw it comin'
I was never what you want and
Like a real-life movie
Didn't think it'd happen to me
Guess it didn't, you just fooled me
Who knew love was so confusin'?

Happiness doesn't mean smilin' when it's your scene
You said we were doin' fine as you set the whole place on fire
I tried everything, turns out we can't compete
Oh, reality is never quite as good as the dream

No, I won't dance anymore
No, I won't put on a show
And you can blame it on me
I don't care what they think
No, I won't let you control
No, I won't be what you want
And you can blame it on me
I don't care what you think
You might also like
From the moment I saw you
I had never felt I could choose
It was always gonna be you
Even when they told me not to
You were all I wanted
But now you're gone and
What good's a promise
If you're never really honest?

No, I won't dance anymore
No, I won't put on a show
And you can blame it on me
I don't care what they think
No, I won't let you control
No, I won't be what you want
And you can blame it on me
I don't care what you think

By the way, piece by piece
I found out my hero's me
By the way, piece by piece
I found out my hero's me
Happiness doesn't mean smilin' when it's your scene
You made sure to keep me small enough to keep me in-between
Should I stay, should I leave? Could I ever compete
With the bar you set so high that you could never even reach?

No, I won't dance anymore
No, I won't put on a show
And you can blame it on me (You can blame it on me)
I don't care what they think (I don't care what they think)
No, I won't let you control
No, I won't be what you want
And you can blame it on me (You can blame it on me)
I don't care what you think (I don't care what you think)

By the way, piece by piece
I found out my hero's me
By the way, piece by piece
