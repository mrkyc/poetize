Even though she knows how much its gonna hurt
Before I say another word
Let me tell you I love you
Let me hold you close and say these words just as gently as I can
There's been another man that I've needed and I've loved
That doesn't mean that I love you any less
And he knows he can't possess me
And knows he never will
Its just this empty place inside me
That only he can fill

Torn between two lovers
Feeling like a fool
Loving both of you is breaking all the rules
Torn between two lovers
Feeling like a fool
Loving you both is breaking all the rules
You might soon think you've failed me
Just because there's someone else
You were the first real love I ever had
And all the things I've ever said
I swear there're still all true
For no one else can have that part of me..... I gave to you

I couldn't really blame you
If you just turned and walked away
But with everything I feel inside
I'm asking you to stay
