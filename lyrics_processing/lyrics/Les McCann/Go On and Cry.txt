Go on and cry
You're better off without him
Go on and cry
Be glad that you are free
Go on and cry
It really doesn't matter
Remember how I cried
When you left me

When you told me that you were leavin' me
I almost went out of my head
There's a part, a part of me that's gone now
And I remember every word you said (Hit me, baby)

Go on and cry
Don't try to hide your sorrow
Go on and cry
Let your feelings show
Go on and cry
The sun will shine tomorrow
And you will find
What it is you gotta know
You might also like
I can feel everything that you're goin' through
Yeah, 'cause I used to be your lover man
But you had to do everything you had to, baby
Believe me, I understand


Baby, baby, baby
I thought I'd never, never, never stop cryin'
Say baby, can't you see it's you I love?
Believe me, I ain't lyin'

Baby, baby, baby
Let me tell you 'bout my situation
It's been three long years, baby, that you've been gone
Three long years, years of desperation

At last I'm on my feet, on my feet again
And there's nothing, honey, I ain't been through
I know that if I can get myself together, baby
Yeah baby, you can do it too
I was hurtin', yeah, and I could not see where the pain was comin' from
And I didn't think that I could shake it
But I kept on movin' step by step
The only way that I could make it, I'm talkin'

(Step by step) Gotta keep on movin'
(Step by step) Gotta keep on movin'
(Step by step) Yeah, keep on searchin'
(Step by step) Gotta keep on learnin'
(Step by step) Keep on moving, yeah
(Step by step)
(Step by step) Clean up the mess, gotta clean it up
(Step by step) You can do it, yeah, I said
(Step by step) Step by step by step
(Step by step) Ooh, girl
(Step by step) Ooh
