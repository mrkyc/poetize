Okay
Game face
There we go

I've got bipolar disorder
My shit's not in order
I'm overweight, I'm always late
I've got too many things to say
I rock mom jeans, cat earrings
Extrapolate my feelings
My family is dysfunctional
But we have a good time killing each other

They tell us from the time we're young
To hide the things that we don't like about ourselves
Inside ourselves
I know I'm not the only one
Who spent so long attempting to be someone else
Well, I'm over it

I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are
Secrets are
I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are
Secrets are

I can't think straight, I'm so gay
Sometimes I cry a whole day
I care a lot, use an analog clock
And never know when to stop
And I'm passive aggressive
I'm scared of the dark and the dentist
I love my butt and won't shut up
And I never really grew up

They tell us from the time we're young
To hide the things that we don't like about ourselves
Inside ourselves
I know I'm not the only one
Who spent so long attempting to be someone else
Well, I'm over it

I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are
Secrets are
I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are
Secrets are
So, what?
So, what?
So, what?
So, what?

Eeeeeeh Oooh Ooooohhh Ooooooooh
(Ha ha ha ha ha)

I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are (Secrets are)
Secrets are
I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are (Secrets are)
Secrets are

So, what?
So, what?
So, what?
So, what?

So, what?
So, what?
(I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are)
So, what?
