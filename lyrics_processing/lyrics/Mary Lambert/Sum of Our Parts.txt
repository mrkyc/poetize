This is my skin that I've never fit in
I was born the queen of nowhere
This is how it begins
I wonder is this your life
Were you raised in deep water
Are they pushing you down
Are you gonna push harder

I want to know whoever broke you
I want to know how you can grow bigger
Don't go looking for some kind of rescue
You are the only one who can save you

We are, we are more than our scars
We are, we are more than the sum of our parts
We are, we are more than our scars
We are, we are more than the sum of our parts

I didn't know I was a phoenix
'Til I learned how to speak
Even with ashes in my mouth
I was still born to breathe
I wonder are you like me?
Were you left in the fire?
Are you raising yourself
Above your father's empire?
You might also like
I want to know whoever broke you
I want to know how you can grow bigger
Don't go looking for some kind of rescue
You are the only one who can save you

We are, we are more than our scars
We are, we are more than the sum of our parts
We are, we are more than our scars
We are, we are more than the sum of our parts
(More than our scars)
(More than the sum of of our parts)

(I burn bright)
(I burn bright)
Look how bright we are
Look at all the things we have come from
Sometimes it hurts when you become them
Sometimes I bury myself in my own wreckage and
Don't want to come out
Which part of you is still in the wreckage?
Which part of you clipped your own wings?
Which part of you will begin at your own end?
Which part of you will you let live again?
We are, we are more than our scars
We are, we are more than the sum of our parts
We are, we are more than our scars
We are, we are more than the sum of our parts

More than our scars
More than the sum of our parts
More than our scars
