I don't wanna go to work
I don't wanna go to sleep
I don't wanna do it
I don't wanna do it
I don't wanna pay my rent
I don't wanna write a song
I don't wanna do it
I don't wanna do it

It could be that I'm lazy
Or unmotivated
I've got plenty to do

I just wanna hang out with you
Just wanna hang out with you
But I wanna hang out with you
Just wanna hang out with you

I don't wanna call my friends
I don't wanna hit the bar
I don't wanna do it
I don't wanna do it
I don't wanna fix my hair
I don't wanna play a show
I don't wanna do it
I don't wanna do it
You might also like
Everybody's been wondering
Where have I been?
When they cutting it loose
It could be that I'm lazy
Or unmotivated
I've got plenty to do

I just wanna hang out with you
Just wanna hang out with you
But I wanna hang out with you
Just wanna hang out with you
Just wanna hang out with you

I know that the days are mine
And when I wake up it's
Not always just this magic
But all I see is a heart I want
And when I'm with you it's
Something to do with magic
I know that the days are mine
And when I wake up it's
Not always just this magic
But all I see is the heart I want
And when I'm with you it's
Something to do with magic
But I wanna hang out with you
Just wanna hang out with you
But I wanna hang out with you
Just wanna hang out with you
Just wanna hang out with you
Just wanna hang out with you
But I wanna hang out with you
Just wanna hang out with you
But I wanna hang out with you
Just wanna hang out with you
But I wanna hang out with you
Just wanna hang out with you
