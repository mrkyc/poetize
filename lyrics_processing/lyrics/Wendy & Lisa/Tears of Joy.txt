In the morning, I wake up
Turn around and there's no one there
Wash my hair, do my make-up
It's a new day out there

Tears of joy, smiles of sorrow (Tears of joy)
Where do such strange feelings come from?
Can't be sure of tomorrow (Can't be sure of tomorrow)
But I know the day will come
Tears of joy, smiles of sorrow (Tears of joy)
I finally know what I'm lookin' for (I finally know what I'm lookin' for)
And I'm sure that tomorrow
Say hello and I'll be yours (Say hello)

Say hello such a strange word
Such a strange way to say hello
It's so hard for me sometimes
Like love's first night alone
Anyway, it's a pleasure
To know someone's waiting just for me
I'll find my buried treasure
And tears of joy will rain on me
You might also like
Tears of joy, smiles of sorrow (Tears of joy)
Where do such strange feelings come from?
Can't be sure of tomorrow (Can't be sure of tomorrow)
But I know the day will come
Tears of joy, smiles of sorrow (Tears of joy)
I finally know what I'm lookin' for (I finally know what I'm lookin' for)
And I'm sure that tomorrow
Say hello and I'll be yours (Say hello)

Can you hear me breathin'?
I just know that you're listening
And I'm longin' to know you
You're no stranger to me
And in the morning, I'll wake up
Turn around and you will be there
I'll kiss you and you'll wake up
And run your fingers through my hair

Tears of joy, smiles of sorrow (Tears of joy)
Where do such strange feelings come from?
Can't be sure of tomorrow (Can't be sure of tomorrow)
But I know the day will come
Tears of joy, smiles of sorrow (Tears of joy)
I finally know what I'm lookin' for (I finally know what I'm lookin' for)
And I'm sure that tomorrow
Say hello and I'll be yours (Say hello)
And I'll be yours
