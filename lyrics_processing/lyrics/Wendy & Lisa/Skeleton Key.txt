Stop the clock and follow it
Way down inside your mind
Life rolls by, just keeping time
Doors will open, doors will close, I suppose
Tears may overflow
Still, there's something in the quiet of a heavy sigh
There's security in what you know you keep inside
Touch your skin and feel your bone
Mama says how much you've grown
The mirror wears a pretty face
Eyes that share a better place
You have the chance to break the lead
Don't use the gun you think you need
Love needs not to love your needs, can't you see
You caught me just in time
Then you take the key to free the door, now walk inside
I've been there for you, you reach for me, your heart beats wild
(Skeleton key)
(Skeleton key)
(I'm something you should see)
(Skeleton key)
You curl up, you cannot breathe
Your mind's aware this strengthening
And you click your heels one thousand times
You say a prayer while no-one's around
You realise that deep inside, strength resides
Your key will make it known
Love is courting glimpses of our perfect inner world
With the key in hand you know that you'll be free for sure
You might also likeI am something you should see

Turn me and you will be free
(I'm something you should see)
(Skeleton key)
I am something you should see
(Just turn me, you'll be free)
(Skeleton key)
Turn me and you will be free
(I'm something you should see)
(Skeleton key)

(Skeleton key)
(I'm something you should see)
(Skeleton key)
(Just turn me, you'll be free)
(Skeleton key)
(I'm something you should see)

(Skeleton key)
(I'm something you should see)
(Skeleton key)
(Just turn me, you'll be free)
I am something you should see
(Skeleton key)
I am something you should see
(I'm something you should see)
Turn me, you'll be free for sure
