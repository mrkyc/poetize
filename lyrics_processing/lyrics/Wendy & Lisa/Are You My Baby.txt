Ooh, are you my baby?
Oh, oh, you make me crazy
Won't you be my man?

To my young and foolish heart
Lovin' has no end
Sometimes people grow apart
That's why I am wonderin'

Ooh, are you my baby?
Or are we just friends?
Oh, oh, you make me crazy
Baby, baby, won't you be my man?

I've had dreams I know won't come true
From them, I have grown
But, honey, if I can't have you
I just got to know, that's why I'm askin' you

Ooh, are you my baby? (My baby)
Or are we just friends? (My baby)
Oh, oh, you make me crazy (Say you love me)
Baby, baby, won't you be my man? (Won't you be my man?)
You might also like
I've had lovers in the past
But it always ends
A love like ours will surely last
Because you are my friend

It's a crazy thing, but of you, I sing
I won't be alone 'cause you are my home
You're my lucky card, 'cause in your love I start
You're my only heart, can't you feel its crazy beatin'?

Ooh, are you my baby? (My baby)
Or are we just friends? (My baby)
Ooh, I'ma gonna, gonna go crazy (Say you love me)
Baby, baby, won't you be my man? (Won't you be my man?)

No, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh, are you my baby? (My baby)
Or are we just friends? (My baby)
Ooh, oh, you make me crazy (Say you love me)
Baby, baby, won't you be my man? (Won't you be my man?)
Two, three, four
It's a crazy thing, but of you, I sing
I won't be alone 'cause you are my home
You're my lucky card, 'cause in your love I start
You're my only heart, can't you feel its crazy beatin'?

Ooh, are you my baby? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Be my baby, be my baby)
Or are we just friends? No, no, no, no
Ooh, I'ma gonna go crazy (Be my baby, be my baby)
Baby, baby, won't you be my man?
Ooh, won't you be my baby? (Be my baby, be my baby)
Or are we just friends?
