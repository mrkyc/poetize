Every time you come around, it makes me way too crazy
Crazy enough to think you'll ask me out
Yes, you are the talk of town, so congratulations
With a smile as good as gold, so don't wear a frown
Every time I see you down, still you're not too bitter
You don't need a babysitter to keep you on your cloud
Baby, you know it's true, I'll never be too uptight
To wrap you in my love, to just satisfy you

Didn't your mama tell you, didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction?
Didn't your mama tell you, didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction?

Every time you come around, my heart beats a little faster
You're all the drug, I'm sure I'll ever need
All the time, I do believe, your love is like a prayer
I can take you there if you feel the need
If you let me have it all, I'll shoot for satisfaction
'Cause nothin''s ever meant so much to me
But keep in your mind, we've got to keep on dancin'?
If all else fails, won't you dance with me?

Didn't your mama tell you, didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction? Yeah-e
Didn't your mama tell you, didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction?

If love can melt down barriers, I think I'll marry you

Didn't your mama tell you, didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction? Yeah, yeah-e
Didn't your mama tell you, didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction?

Every time I turn around, the shadow of you is still with me
But a shadow just can't take the place of you
When we touch, caress me cool, kiss me deep, my baby
All I have is for you

Didn't your mama tell you, didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction? Yeah
Didn't your mama tell you, didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction? (Whoo)
If love can melt down barriers, oh, baby, I think I'll marry you
How 'bout it, Jessie? (Aha-ha-ha-aha)
A little satisfaction
Yeah, yeah, hey-yeah
A little satisfaction
Early in the morning, I'm gonna set it up
A little satisfaction
Satisfaction

Didn't your mama tell you, didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction?
