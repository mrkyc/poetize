It makes me way too crazy
Crazy enough to think
That you'll ask me out
Yes, you are the talk of town
So congratulations
With a smile as good as gold
So don't wear a frown
Everytime I see you down
Still you're not too bitter
You don't need a babysitter
To keep you on your cloud
Baby, you know it's true
I'll never be too uptight
To wrap you in my love
To just satisfy you
Didn't your mama tell you
Didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction
Didn't your mama tell you
Didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction
Every time you come around
My heart beats a little faster
You're all the drug
I'm sure I'll ever need
All the time I do believe
Your love is like a prayer
I can take you there
If you feel the need
You might also likeIf you let me have it all
I'll shoot for satisfaction
'Cause nothing's ever meant
So much to me
But keep in your mind
We've got to keep on dancing
If all else fails
Won't you dance with me
Didn't your mama tell you
Didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction
Yeah
Didn't your mama tell you
Didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction
If love can melt down barriers
I think I'll marry you
Didn't your mama tell you
Didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction
Yeah, yeah
Didn't your mama tell you
Didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction
Everytime I turn around
The shadow of you is still with me
But a shadow just can't take
The place of you
When we touch, caress me, cool
Kiss me deep, my baby
All I have is for you
Didn't your mama tell you
Didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction
Yeah
Didn't your mama tell you
Didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction
Yeah
Didn't your mama tell you
Didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction
Yeah
Didn't your mama tell you
Didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction
If love can melt down barriers
Oh baby, I think I'll marry you
