Reached in my pocket lookin' down at the floor
My friend said "hey girl" as I bumped into the door
I grabbed my head tight so I wouldn't feel sore
Ooh ooh
I went back home
To take a little snooze
I said "what the hell, there's nothing else I can do"
And when I got up
I tripped over my shoes
Decided to go out
Cause I got nothin', nothin' to lose
Whew! Baby
Something's coming, something's coming
Something's coming, something's coming
Go to the closet
Ain't got nothin' to wear
Go to the Cupboard
And the cupboard is bare
Go to my parents
And there's nobody there
Get a flat tire
And I ain't got a spare
You might also likeBut I'm not worried cause
Cause I know what I need
I got a lover
And it's his love I feed
A real sweet cup
Will keep him up till morning comes
Fruit at the bottom
Fruit at the bottom
Fruit at the bottom
My lover's got um
Fruit at the bottom
Fruit at the bottom
Fruit at the bottom
My lover's got um
I walk around but
I ain't goin' nowhere
I'm on the ground but it feels like the air
My heads still achin'
And I can't see straight
I missed the last bus now I have to wait
But I'm not worried cause
Cause I know what I need
I got a lover
And it's his love I feed
A real sweet cup
Will keep him up till morning comes
Fruit at the bottom
Fruit at the bottom
Fruit at the bottom
My lover's got um
Fruit at the bottom
Fruit at the bottom
Fruit at the bottom
My lover's got um
Whooo! Baby, ba-aby
Something's coming, something's coming
Something's coming, something's coming
Whaoh
They turned the heat off and my power too
It's so cold out now I got the flu
Went to the doctor there was nothing he could do
Then I sneezed, Auchoo!
But I'm not worried
Cause I know what I need
I got a lover
And it's his love I feed
A real sweet cup
Will keep him up till morning comes
Fruit at the bottom
Fruit at the bottom
Fruit at the bottom
