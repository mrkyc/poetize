Yeah
Uh Uh
Yeah

Yeah we got the realist nigga this rap game is gonna' see
And if you thinking of pussy then come ride on me, come ride on me

They say money is power, power is pain
Niggas selling their soul now they stuck in the game
Wanna push made backs for robbers, killuminati
Dealing with demons tattered on a chrome illuminati
In the rush to live in a hurry to die
100 grand on my wrist but an ice on fly
I'm a player im a pimp im a boss in the game
Smoking weed poppin pills getting lost in the game
AKs on deck them fools wanna feel something
Coked out wanna kill something pill something
Hollow points have them niggas retreat possessed
By the other side we the only ones even
Baptised in the liquid fire
Them niggas fry
But its hopeless cos one day we all gonna die
Keep loading them clips killing blood flood the streets
Screaming ride till i die till I'm six feet deep

And if you thinking of pussy then come ride on me, come ride on me
Yeah, sipping liquor Ciroc got me having wild visions
Of niggas in convers either jammed up in prison
Home invaders jack boys im coming for paper
They be late night creeping pulling daily capers
Got many bodies on shotty, bustin no hesitation
Catching m1 every day paper chasin
Hitting licks out of state jacking niggas for work
All i need is my heat and i put them in dirt
10-20 life niggas strife but never see it
Al capone scarface they wanna be it
In they blood the thug slugs ring out in the night
Poppin pills sippin liquors take it in stride
Only way to prison chain gang on a tshirt
Never short pain but we hurt
Chop a city you can get it at the top of a .,
Getting high with the demons is a daily grind
 X2
