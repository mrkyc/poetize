Blac Haze, representing for my real niggas
Blac Haze, representing, for my real niggas
Let me holla at cha
Let me ride, Let me roll, get inside lose control
Real nigga never fold, money clip stay swole
Got me screaming not really, you motherfuckers kill me
Running game, acting silly only real niggas feel me
Coming up to the fullest,thought I was fallin'
Player haters don't wanna see a nigga ballin'
Dealin' with these niggas, got me pullin' triggers
Pumpin' up gettin' bigger, all up on me like a figure
Don't wanna get a nigga hot, talkin' shit must wanna get a nigga shot
Smoking herb with some old school cats
We go way back. Reminiscing on how we made niggas get flat
Writin' letters to my homie doing five to ten
Can't wait till we motherfucking ride again, don't worry
Nigga chill out, when them bitches let you go, we're gonna peel out
The way a nigga live,we be putting motherfuckers to sleep
I'mma ride till I'm six feet deep
(chorus)
So don't try to tell me how to live my life
Chillin' with my homies smoking weed all night, cos real niggas keep it real, And that's word is born
Riding out to the early morn'
Let me holla at cha
You might also likeHow many niggas on a paper chase, caught up in a paper race
Tryin' to make ends, losing friends to a better place
Living like a villain, player haters heelin'
Lord please forgive me for all the drama and the killin'
Blame it on the Hennessey, I'm falling for satan, let be known for the hard times, all that I'm facing
Smoking weed trying to get a buzz, running with the ghetto thugs
To a young man in the hood, trying to understand
Everybody wanna judge, threatening prophesies laced up with drama seeds,but nobody stops me
Young nigga stay paid, guard your riches, hoes become too scandalous
Better far from bitches, beware of the serpent
Parading like a centipede, full of accuse for all that is enemies
The world is a funny place nigga can't call it
Got me stressed to the fullest, chronic alcoholic
Peep game, let a motherfucker known you all up on it
Be about come up, cos only real niggas want it
Do what cha gotta, but reconcile where you must,cos we all must return to dust
(chores)
So don't try to tell me how to live my life
Chilling with my homies smoking weed all night, cos real niggas keep it real, and that word is born
Riding out to the early morn'
Let me holla at cha
Just riding it on out now, representing for my real niggas
Busting it down for my real niggas
Blac haze representing' for my niggas, representing
Live for material possess, what a repetition, termination of black life
A common expedition, God willin' uplift, going in peace and do it
But who knows, in dead cars. Nobody sure, get to see niggas leaving in an astonishing race, am I hell bound?
I repent, money be straight
All a nigga know how to maintain his cuff, living' in the last days
Lord Knows it's rough,hearing voices screaming nigga; appreciate yo life
A bullet pierce the heart,like a coppers's might
Still rolling with them niggas, I believe it's stuff, keep it real among killers, not giving a fuck
Open fire over chips, I died for my paper. roll a bob, when I rob, when high on a caper
Over miles of air and sea, disproving the written
No one knows I'm problem, keep it real but didn't
Made a record now the motherfuckers know me as haze
Kept my hoes seeing dollar signs, reckon for days, put the wood to the niggas player hatin' my space
Keep em' stressed on a how I stay a laced
(chorus)
So don't try to tell me how to live my life
Chilling with my homies smoking weed all night,cos real niggas keep it real and that's word is born
Riding out to the early morn'
