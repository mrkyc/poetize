How ya gonna die?
When ya die, nigga
I'ma die a hustla
I'ma die makin' money

I'ma die a hustla
I'm smokin' weed and shit
My baby mama keep sayin' she don't need this shit
She said I ain't doin' nothin' for my shorty
I'm like "Whatever"
As I'm sippin' on a forty
Uh, yeah
I got my mind on the come up
'Cause I'm a G
36 ounces to a key
I need to be
On the road with my niggas from the hood
Screamin', "It's all good, it's all good, it's all good"
I often wonder should I stay in the game
'Cause I got too many enemies takin aim
I learned that niggas that beef
Be tryin' to kill niggas
So if you see me hangin', I'm hangin' with real niggas
And I'll be bustin' at bitches and shit
Tryin to get the heck out
Swervin at my ride bout to wreck out
Damn
I can't complain cause that's the life I chose
Nigga, I'ma be a hustler 'til my casket close
And everybody's tellin' me, "You movin' too fast"
The street life don't last
Look at your homies that passed
And even though deep inside
I know they talkin' true shit
I still wanna do shit
Nigga, I'ma die a hustla

Ain't got no time for fuckin with hoes
They gotta wait
'Cause a nigga gotta get his money straight
'Cause niggas be actin' shady
When it come to green
Don't be fuckin' with my money
If you come, then come clean
You fools better wise up
I'm like what's displayed
'Cause I'ma 2 gunshots shoot a nigga, ask questions later
If I'ma die, nigga, I'm not dyin' alone
I'll be machine gun until my bullets gone
And only real niggas, can feel my pain
I once thought I was crazy but now I know I'm insane
Smokin' out, I'm the king of the base point
Me and my niggas rollin' up a fat laced joint
Tryin' to survive
I need paper to fold
Every other day I'm violatin' parole
Am I going back to jail?
I'll be damned if I will
I ain't shootin' to stop a nigga
I'm shootin' to kill
I lived my whole entire life in the fast lane
That's why I'm burned out
Never thought the streets would have a nigga's soul turned out
I'ma get me, no matter how I get it
And tell the police that Blac Haze did it
I'ma die a hustla
For real, yeah
How ya gonna die?
When ya die, nigga
I'ma die a hustla
I'ma die makin' money
How ya gonna die?

Could it be the street life?
Or am I really losin' my mind?
I get the trippin' nigga with my nine
When I low my shit you better stand clear
And call the coroner 'cause there's a dead man here
See, I be watchin' the niggas who wanna be large
Or maybe bigger
I catch a hot one and get to pullin' on the trigger
That's why I'm packin' five
When I'm packin' key's
So many homies that turned into my enemies
So don't be fakin' this shit
Like if you gonna blast
'Cause when I turn out the lights
You all outta gas
They got me caught up in the drama of the inner city
Who can a nigga trust?
Everybody's actin' shitty
I don't know where to turn
So I'ma chill back
And I'ma tighten my grip when I feel slacked
I don't want no small change
I want a big caper
I'm runnin' with the big boys
Makin' big papers
'Cause when I roll, I'll be rollin' with a dirty clip
Dirty guns and dirty bullets make you dirty quick
And we be layin playa haters down
Like the law
You said you want it
We serve it raw
Nigga, I'ma die a hustla
For real, yeah
How ya gonna die?
When ya die, nigga
I'ma die a hustla
I'ma die makin' money
How ya gonna die?
When ya die, nigga
I'ma die a hustla
