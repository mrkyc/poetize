You wanna ride, we can ride cuz I'm the realest

Ain't to many mother fuckas bad as us
You mad at us u wonder why we had to bust
You got love for my shit thats fabulous
All these hoes be grabbin us
What's your name? where you from?
Do u plan on givin me some?
If you won't I won't fight
You never know maybe your girlfriend might
Freak me down before I leave
Pass the blunt, hit the weed
You can bounce if you too fly
Gotta watch out can't get to high
Fuck these hoes, gotta get G's
Benjamins, gotta get keys
Sexually, gotta get pleased
Sex ain't free, gotta pay fees
Niggas can chill, ain't no stress
The weed still all up im my chest
Niggas wanna bust with a bulletproof vest
Bust em all who to shoot next
You won't freak please dont front
Lick you up like a Philly blunt
