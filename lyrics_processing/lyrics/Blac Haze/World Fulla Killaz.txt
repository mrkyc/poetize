Live Shot
Blac Haze represent

They got me smokin' weed cause the situation got me vexed
Never livin' to see what's next, funny how we flex
Critical situations, ain't nothing iller
Living in a world fulla killaz

Bullet wounds can make the roughest nigga scream for momma
I wonder why we fiend for drama
The media continues to paint violent pictures
No longer untouchable let the motherfuckers get you
But god has a place for the devils
The false prophet fiending for collection
Disregarding his Resurrection
Let me holla at cha
Greaters see what's in me
I let my spirit tell it
How many missionaries worshiping the relic
But still I'm screaming maintain niggas
Coming up ain't a breeze
Think about your frail existence when you move in the keys
This could be the last caper
Time to holla at the reaper
Am I your brothers keeper
My brain stay twisted with homicides I have witnessed
Many were personal but the majority was business
Many onlookers don't realise what it means to see a man take his last breath before your eyes

They got me smokin' weed cause the situation got me vexed
Never livin' to see what's next, funny how we flex
Critical situations, ain't nothing iller
Living in a world fulla killaz

Pull out some liquor for my niggas that was blown to pieces
Tragic is but that is what happens when the chrome releases
I hear them shots ringing in my head lord collect em
Forgive my homies for their sins let your glory protect em
How many niggas gonna die tonight we can't call it
We stay on ses plus we all alcoholics running
From the cops cos they killers and rapists
They be the main motherfuckers robbin niggas for papers
How many niggas doing 25 years or better
My baby mamas dropped the child support scared I might quit her
Some body tell me why wile out serial hits
And the motherfuckers lives over trivial shit
Hard times be provoking niggas to blast on site
Caught up in the hell and fury niggas blast all night
It's the beginning of the end we caught up in chambers
Using violence to express our anger

They got me smokin' weed cause the situation got me vexed
Never livin' to see what's next, funny how we flex
Critical situations, ain't nothing iller
Living in a world fulla killaz
(Gun Fire Exchange, police sirens)
How much weed can a motherfucker smoke fiending like a baser
Straight gin no chaser
Let me holla
Motherfuckers better recognise blessed to be
Try to diminish my image
Get the best of me
Young gs pack a fire
No remorse no love
Size em up if you want to
You be swallowing slugs
Seems everything occurring was probable and predicted
Poisonous play leave the drugs leaving masons addicted
Got me screaming don't get caught in the bullshit g
Can always pray for you but won't let them bullshit me
Look at how us young niggas stay caught up in prison
God was talking to my heart but my soul wouldn't listen
Hard lesson to be learned so much time was wasted
If a come up was available best believe I'd chase it
Born my legacy passed on to kids
God judging these people look at the things we did

They got me smokin' weed cause the situation got me vexed
Never livin' to see what's next, funny how we flex
Critical situations, ain't nothing iller
