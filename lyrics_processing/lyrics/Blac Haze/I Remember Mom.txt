I reminesce on my mom
Bout the good times we had and the bad times

I remember mom she used to hold me in her arms
The feelin was a charm
Ain't no need to be alarmed
Hittin me up with the love we was poor
I can recall livin on the run I can't imgaine all the pain that my mom felt
Tryin to raise 3 kids on a small wealth
Hard times wasn't nothin but a way of life
My mom never knew she would have to sacrifice
My old man hit the road neglected his spouse
I had no choice now im the man of the house
The possibilities grew at a fast rate
Now Im on the street tryin to get that cash straight
Tryin to stay up out of jail at the same time
A young G claiming fame the game is mine
My old girl had my back through all
The stess and drama took a test of time
In my mind I remember mama
Chorus: repeat 4x
Ooh mama mama mama ooh mama mama mama
I remember mama
You might also like
I thought my mom would live forever my fools fake
I can't recall my actions at school straight
I'm skippin class thinkin its the thing to do
No education watch what that brings to you
My old man was a crack fiend won't lie
Need to change his ways I know he won't try
Everytime he came around it was mad drama
I couldn't take it always hittin on my mama
He had no idea he was breakin me down
I was screamin out loud without makin a sound
One day I just snapped to my suprise stood up to my dad looked him dead in his eye
I guess God gave me strength to deal with that
Told my old man he gotta chill with that
No more beatin on my mom better watch that
I'm a man so you better squash that
Chorus:

Mom, I remember mom all the love I remember
You have a place in my heart forever
She was down for me everytime I fell
Mama had to come get me at the county jail
Look at me in the courtroom facin time
Hopin the judge reduce my crime
Mama never used to fuss but I knew she was hurt
Look at me on the street corner puttin in work
I tried hide to hide the fact that I was slangin rocks
Mama used to find crack bags in my socks
I would lie until the day they wasn't mine
But you can rest asure and do time
It all came to the light she knew the scoops
I was out runnin with the wrong groups
Mama needed me so I had to change my style
And on top of that im lookin at a brand new child
I ain't no time for havin cops chasin me
Realizing jail ain't the place to be
I remember
Chorus
This song is for anybody who's lost somebody
Ya know what I'm sayin
I lost my mom
But she still lives with me in my heart
To the day I leave to the day I die
I will forever keep u in my mind and my heart
Cuz I remember
I remember
