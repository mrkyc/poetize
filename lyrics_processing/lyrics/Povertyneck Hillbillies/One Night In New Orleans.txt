On a superbowl Sunday
In a bar with a big screen TV
She was there with some girls
They were down from Montreal
And she walked right up to me
She said, Voulez vous danse?
And she started to move
I said, Baby, I dont parlez vous
She said, "Voulez vous touche
Then she took me by the hand
And I knew that she wanted to dance
Ya c'est la vie baby
Whatever you say
I'll do anything if you put it that way
Voulez vous l'amour
I found out what that means
One night in New Orleans
Looking in her eyes
I saw the French quarter
The way I had never seen
Kisses in Binet's
Strawberry's and champagne
One night in New Orleans

She smiled and whipered

Although I never told her I loved her
That night in New Orleans, I did
