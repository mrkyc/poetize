Well everybody said "Son, you'll never get nowhere"
With my stubbon ways, well I knew that I would show them
You can't keep somethin' wild wrapped up in a cage
After time went by they finally realized I was on my way
Goin' down that two lane road
Stretched out across the desert
With the hot sun beatin' down on me
I don't know where I'm going
Or when I'm gonna get there
But when I do it will set my mind at ease
I was born, I was born to be free
Lookin' back now I think about those days
And how that one summer changed everything
But in the back of my mind
I still hear the voices
Reminding me that I did it right there
After time went by they finally realized I was on my way
Goin' down that two lane road
Stretched out across the desert
With the hot sun beatin' down on me
I don't know where I'm going
Or when I'm gonna get there
But when I do it will set my mind at ease
I was born, I was born to be free
