Do you think I don't know that
You say I should forget her
Pull myself together, shes never coming back
You tell me its time to get over her
Thats easy for you to say
You ain't saying nothing I don't tell myself every day
Tell me what I don't know
Like where do I go from here
If you really wanna tell me somethin' that'll help me
Tell me how to stop these tears
Tell me how do I forget her
Tell me how to let her go
Tell me how to live without her
Tell me what I don't know
You say that I'll be fine its just a matter of time
That sure makes me feel good
You tell me all I gotta do is find somebody new
Yeah, I know I should
You say she played me for a fool
What a suprise
And I know you've got good intentions
But if you wanna tell me your advice
You might also likeTell me what I don't know
Like where do I go from here
If you really wanna tell me somethin' that'll help me
Tell me how to stop these tears
Tell me how do I forget her
Tell me how to let her go
Tell me how to live without her
Tell me what I don't know
Tell me what I don't know
Like where do I go from here
If you really wanna tell me somethin' that'll help me
Tell me how to stop these tears
Tell me how do I forget her
Tell me how to let her go
Tell me how to live without her
Tell me what I don't know
Tell me how do I forget her
Tell me how to let her go
Tell me how to live without her
Tell me what I don't know
Tell me what I don't know

Stuck On You
Stuck on you
Got this feelin' down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
I'm on my way
I needed and the way I feel now
I guess I'll be with you 'til the end
I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed
Stuck on you
Been a fool too long
I guess its time for me to come on home
I'm on my way
So hard to see
Why a woman like you
Would wait around for a man like me
I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed
Woah, I'm leavin' on that midnight train tomorrow
And I know just where I'm goin'
I've packed up my troubles
And I've thrown 'em all away
Cause this time little darlin'
I'm comin' home to stay
I'm stuck on you
Got this feelin' down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
I'm on my way
I needed and the way I feel now
I guess I'll be with you 'til the end
I'm on my way
