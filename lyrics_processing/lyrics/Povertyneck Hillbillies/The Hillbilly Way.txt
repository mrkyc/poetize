Up in the country thats what we do it's a tradition
I'm carryin through
(Chorus)
You might not like what you see but that don't matter to me
Cause i'm gonna do it the hillbilly way thats were i was born
It's how i was raised if you don't like what i'm doin
What can i say hey the only way i know how to do it
Is the hillbilly way
Well i can plow a field, hunt for my food, light a fire
Pass around the home brew saturday night i truck into town
Raise a little hell closes honkey tonk down
(Chorus)
You might not like what you see but that don't matter to me
Cause i'm gonna do it the hillbilly way thats were i was born
It's how i was raised if you don't like what i'm doin
What can i say hey the only way i know how to do it
Is the hillbilly way
When it comes to women one thing i learned
I gotta be myself or i crash and burn
Theres a girl im seein later today
She seems to like it the hillbilly way
You might also like(Chorus)
You might not like what you see that really doesn't matter to me
Cause i'm gonna do it the hillbilly way thats were i was born
It's how i was raised if you don't like what i'm doin
What can i say hey the only way i know how to do it
Is the hillbilly way
I'm gonna do it the hillbilly way thats were i was born
It's how i was raised if you don't like what i'm doin
What can i say hey the only way i know how to do it
Well the only way i kno how to do it is the hillbilly way
