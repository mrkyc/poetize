Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
La La La La La La La La
La La La La La La La La
Come as you are
Baby bring your scars
Everything is fine
It's gonna be alright
A girl I've seen around
Has the face of a clown
You know the happy upside-down-look
Although her mouth looks glad
Her eyes are sad
She says she's heavy like her daddy
It's like she feels so much
That she kills the rush
She's unhappy all of the time
She's a twisted wristcutter

And wave 'em like you just don't care
Come as you are
Baby bring your scars
Everything is fine
It's gonna be alright
And just the other night
I could hear him cry
Although he lives two blocks away
And his every idol was suicidal
His belowed Kurt Co-bang bang bang
Mhm
But there's no nirvana
Beacuse he doesn't wanna
He's unhappy all the time
He's a twisted wristcutter
