I got love for you
Yes I do, but are you really true
'Cause you too good at playing cool
Thinkin' what to do, what do I do when
I gave all my time in seconds
That was up to you

Okay, look
I know mischievous people
Got me uneasy with people
How come the selfish and greediest people
Always seem like they're the neediest people
I don't need hidden agendas
I can't believe we were that close
You know I went at this flat out
But you thought if I made it you'd cash out
Oh yeah, I know
You complain about what I didn't do
You should think about what I did for you
Instead of ridicule, get a different view
But you don't
I don't need fake smiles and the slick talk
I know you can't wait 'til I slip up
I'm talking real life not just hip hop and you know
(If you don't care) If you don't care, keep it genuine
You can talk that shit 'til the end of time
But don't try to front, you ain't a friend of mine
I need some loyalty
Some try to apologize for the unforgiven
Some got your back, some stab you in it
Cold love
You might also like
I got love for you
Yes I do, but are you really true
'Cause you too good at playing cool
Thinkin' what to do, what do I do when
I gave all my time in seconds
That was up to you

You don't care (You don't care)
You don't care
Cold love, it's cold love
You don't care (You don't care)
You don't care
You don't, you don't, you don't care
You don't care
Yeah

Money
Does good things, does evil things
Pulls peoples' string, it makes egos big
It makes people kings and do deceitful things
I know
When they asked about me you would show me love
Now they ask and you just kinda shoulder shrug
Used to hold me up, now you cold as fuck
My bro
I don't need fake love or fake lap dance
I don't need anybody tryna take from me
Tryna fuck me over like the tax man, I don't
So I walked out quick on the in crowd
'Cause I know now who really been down
If you stuck around and never skipped town and (You don't, you don't care)
Don't try to congratulate me on my success
When as soon as I leave the room
You still comment on what I do and how I dress
High school shit
Take a puff or two just to get me through
Feelin' cynical but that's typical
Need to hold up from that cold love 'cause you
I got love for you
Yes I do, but are you really true
'Cause you too good at playing cool
Thinkin' what to do, what do I do when
I gave all my time in seconds
That was up to you

You don't care (You don't care)
You don't care
Yeah, cold love, it's cold love
You don't care (You don't care)
You don't care
You don't, you don't, you don't care
(Bumpin' this real shit, bumpin' this real shit)
You don't care
(Every night, bumping every night)
Yeah
(Bumpin' this real shit, bumpin' this real shit)
Yeah
(Every night, bumping every night)

Shiver me timbers
I feel the love cold in December
That bitter wind keeps blowing in
Lookin' for someone to soak it in and
It's making me shiver
I'm pushing on through the winter
'Cause they say they want me to win
But that's only if it does something for them
