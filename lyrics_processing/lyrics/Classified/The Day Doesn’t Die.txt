This day doesn't die 'til... (9x)

Forgive, forget
That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet
We try (Yeah, yeah, we try)
We cry (Yeah, yeah, we cry)
But a day doesn't die 'til the sun is set

Uh, yeah, night falls, days come and go
No retreat, stubborn, played the role
Held a grudge, seen it takes it's toll
I guess it proves I still got a way to go
Got to stop being so hard headed and hard nosed
And get rid of the excess cargo
You know, lighten up my carload
'Cause I keep veerin' on back down to her road
Uh, I've been lied to and cheated on
I've been shit talked, beat down, treated wrong
And I won't forgive or forget
But I don't wanna live with regret
And so I hope that I can let go, move on
Try to forgive anybody who did Luke wrong
Yeah, right, I can hold hope, hoping it'll do
But I don't think I got the will to

Forgive, forget
That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet
We try (Yeah, yeah, we try)
We cry (Yeah, yeah, we cry)
But a day doesn't die 'til the sun is set

He goes, balls to the walls 'till I drop
Love what I am, hate what I'm not
I no longer talk or text message
Any ex-girlfriends or these ex-best friends
Who left me stress and this neck tension
And who never paid any dues but expect pension
So that's why our friendship is suspended
And if you thought I'd forget, guess again
I don't have it in me, don't have the discipline
Eye for an eye, the adreneline is kicking in
Burn me once, then it's shame on you
If I let it happen twice, then it's shame on me
Okay, I get it
This is part of the vicious cycle we live in
So unforgivin'
Stay gettin' heated with anyone who burns us
Dwell on a grudge, but I'm still tryin' to learn to
Forgive, forget
That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet
We try (Yeah, yeah, we try)
We cry (Yeah, yeah, we cry)
But a day doesn't die 'til the sun is set

The day doesn't die... (5x)

Sometimes I think I'm a rebel
But I'm trying to be the bigger man and never sink to your level
I try to stay subtle in all my neighbours' drama
They're tellin' the police that I'm growin' marajuana
Thanks, ya lyin' punk bitch-ass wipe
Pricks come and go everyday, that's life
And truth be told, many other episodes occurred
But you ain't worth my time for a full verse
Shit, I'd forgive, but I never will (forget, forget)

That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet
We try, we cry
But a day doesn't die til the sun is set
Forgive, forget
That's a lesson that we haven't learned yet
We try, we cry
