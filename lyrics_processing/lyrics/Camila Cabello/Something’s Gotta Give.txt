Loving you, I thought I couldn't get no higher
Your November rain could set the night on fire, night on fire
But we could only burn so long
Counterfeit emotions only run skin deep
Know you're lyin' when you're lyin' next to me, next to me
How did we get so far gone?

I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now

Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go, ooh

I have never heard a silence quite so loud
I walk in the room and you don't make a sound, make a sound
You're good at makin' me feel small
If it doesn't hurt me, why do I still cry?
If it didn't kill me, then I'm half alive, half alive
How did we get so far gone?

I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now

Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go

I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breakin' right now, oh
I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breakin' right now

Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
All I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change (Something's gotta change)
No, I know that it won't (I know that it won't)
No reason to stay is a good reason to go, oh yeah
Is a good reason to go, ooh
