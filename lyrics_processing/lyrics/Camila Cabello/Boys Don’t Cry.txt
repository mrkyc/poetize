I know thoughts you don't want in your head
Are spinnin' round-round-round
I know you got demons from the past
Slowin' you down-down-down
But you don't answer your FaceTime
You never had much of a poker face
It doesn't make you less of a man
You're just human right now

When I'm afraid of the world, when every part of me hurts
You don't know how many times you've saved me
So why you hidin' from me? It's only makin' it worse
I just wanna be close, my baby

Give me your pain, I'll take the weight off your shoulders
Don't be afraid, fall into me, let me hold ya
We weren't made to hold back the rain  from the sky
Who ever told you that boys don't cry, boys don't cry?

Hate it when you shut me out
Actin' like it's your shit to figure out
Don't wanna be touched, don't wanna discuss
I get it, I just, uh
Now I'm in my head about what's in your head
Come back to bed, can we talk about it?
It's not stupid, it's not drama
It's just trauma turned to armor
Keepin' you from me, no performing
If you love me, come and touch me, yeah
