Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, I promise
Ooh

Tell me something, but say it with your hands, slow
When you touch me, paint me like a Van Gogh, oh
I wanna study every inch of you
'Til you trust me to make the angels come through

Like a choir singin' "Hallelujah"
When my body's crashin' right into ya
When we align, ooh yeah
Do you feel me? Can you feel me?
'Cause I can't breathe

Where did you come from, baby?
And were you sent to save me?
Ooh, there's God in every move
Ooh, and you're the livin' proof (Oh)
The way your hands can shake me
Soft to the touch, they break me
Ooh, there's God in every move
Ooh, and you're the livin' proof (Oh)
