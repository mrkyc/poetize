In a New York taxi cab
With an English man
I've never been kissed like that
So come on, kiss me again
And I felt your heartbeat
Driving down Charlotte Street for the first time
Now we're slow dancing in your kitchen
How time's passed by

We ran out of time again tonight
Happens like this every time
So what are you doin' for the rest of your life?

Baby, keep kissing me softly
Holding me, whispering quietly
Darling, I think that this might be the greatest love story
That's never been, never been, never been, never been easy
It's a new feeling I'm finding
Where the hell have you been hiding?
We'll tell the moon when we're old
The greatest love story that's never been told

Now we're walking hand-in-hand
In an English town
Gonna meet your momma and dad
And I'm nervous now
Now I'm in your home
Eating Sunday roast
And I say the wrong thing
Then you catch my eye, give me a smile
Say you fit right in

Baby, keep kissing me softly
Holding me, whispering quietly
Darling, I think that this might be the greatest love story
That's never been, never been, never been, never been easy
It's a new feeling I'm finding
Where the hell have you been hiding?
We'll tell the moon when we're old
The greatest love story that's never been told

Funny how no one knows all of our inside jokes
You know my demons by name, I know your beautiful soul
All of the secret we keep, you know that I'll never leave

So just keep kissing me softly
Holding me, whispering quietly
Darling, I think that this might be the greatest love story
That's never been told
Never been easy
It's a new feeling I'm finding
Where the hell have you been hiding?
We'll tell the moon when we're old
The greatest love story that's never been told
And yet, there's still so much left to unfold
