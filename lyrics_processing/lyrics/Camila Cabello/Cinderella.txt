It seems the floor's getting colder since I laid on it
And I held hands with the car cause he was late on it
I did my liner, put on but she's on his phone fronting
(Look at him fronting, look, look at him fronting)
Cause it's 3 AM and it ain't the same
And the sign is clear when the phone don't ring
Why, oh, why
She said a dream is a wish your heart makes
And he's a sad reality

Cinderella never asked for a prince (no)
Just a dress, there anybody like this? (no)
If the shoe won't fit then I'll walk barefoot to the moon
If you fall when the clock hits the spot then

Instagram that just won't do
Back then I managed the crew
At twelve it's just me in my ripped skinny jeans
But I'm still a damn princess to you
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Bibbidi-bobbiidi-boo
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Bibbidi-bobbiidi-boo

I broke a sweat tryna catch you single blame from it
But you're not listening, oh, you want kissing
I'm not asking for your red wine
But couldn't have you hold me down
I mean is this supposed to be like a date or something?

Cinderella never asked for a prince, (no)
Just a dress, there anybody like this? (no)
If the shoe won't fit then I'll walk barefoot to the moon
If you fall when the clock hits the spot then

Us twenty first century girls need chivalry too
If you fall when the clock hits the spot then

Once upon a time there was a boy with a face divine
But he couldn't understand how to be a gentleman
And so the lady said farewell, she deserved better for real
And now he's crying alone
Cause she sassed him with this song, oh
Cinderella never asked for a prince, (no)
Just a dress, there anybody like this? (no)
If the shoe won't fit then I'll walk barefoot to the moon
If you fall when the clock hits the spot then
If you fall when the clock hits the spot then

Mhm, I'm still a damn princess to you
