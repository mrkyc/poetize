Why did you leave me here to burn?
I'm way too young to be this hurt
I feel doomed in hotel rooms starin' straight up at the wall
Countin' wounds, and I am tryin' to numb them all

Do you care, do you care? Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me, my blood, my sweat, my heart and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?
I was there, I was there when no one was
Now you're gone and I'm here

I have questions for you
Number one, tell me, who you think you are?
You got some nerve tryin' to tear my faith apart
I have questions for you
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I should have never ever ever trusted you
I have questions
Number three, why weren't you who you swore that you would be?
I have questions, I've got questions hauntin' me

I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you

My, my name was safest in your mouth
And why'd you have to go and spit it out?
Oh, your voice, it was the most familiar sound
But it sounds so dangerous to me now

I have questions for you (Hey)
Number one, tell me, who you think you are?
You got some nerve tryin' to tear my faith apart
I have questions for you
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I should have never ever ever trusted you
I have questions for you (Oh)

I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you

Do you care, do you care? Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me, my blood, my sweat, my heart and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?
I was there, I was there when no one was
Now you're gone and I'm here
I have questions for you (Oh)

I have questions for you

I have questions for you
How do I fix it? Can we talk?
Can we communicate? Can we talk?
Do I wanna fix it?
I have questions for you
I'm afraid of you
Is it my fault? Is it my fault?
Do you miss me?
