In the middle of a storm, never touching the brake
I drove like a bat outta hell
Down that lonely ol' four-lane
With the bright lights of Houston just fadin' behind
My tires tearin' up the road t'ward the state-line
I was leavin' the great Lone Star state
That I loved, for good
For the love of a good woman who lives in Louisiana
On a bayou by the river with the moon in her hair
And when I get there, I'm gonna get down on one knee
'Cause wherever she is, boy, that's home for me
Don't get me wrong:
Love's the only reason I'd ever leave Texas;
She's the only reason I'd ever stay gone
Just about Baton Rouge, I was changin' my mind
Thinkin' 'bout all the things I'd be leavin' behind
Like a Red River sunrise
And the stars on a Galveston night
For the love of a good woman who lives in Louisiana
On a bayou by the river with the moon in her hair
And when I get there, I'm gonna get down on one knee
'Cause wherever she is, boy, that's home for me
Don't get me wrong:
Love's the only reason I'd ever leave Texas;
An' she's the only reason I'd ever stay gone
You might also likeLike a long lonely night
Wonderin' where I'd spend the rest of my life
Gone, like an old tumbleweed
Rollin' his way a place he can't find to call home
Instrumental break
For the love of a good woman who lives in Louisiana
On a bayou by the river with the moon in her hair
And when I get there, I'm gonna get down on one knee
'Cause wherever she is, boy, that's home for me
Don't get me wrong:
Love's the only reason I'd ever leave Texas;
An' she's the only reason I'd ever stay gone
Love's the only reason I'd ever leave Texas;
An' you're the only reason I'd ever stay gone
