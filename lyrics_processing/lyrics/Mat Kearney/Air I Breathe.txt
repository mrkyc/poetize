Born and raised
Under the rain and a Western Wind
Felt the weight
Trying to live up to they say I am
Is it any wonder
Shame comes calling my first name
Is there any question
If I'm the one here left to blame

It's the same fight all over again
It's the same bite breaking on my skin
It's the same light when you let me in
You let me in, You let me in

You are the air I breathe (Oh-oh-oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh oh)
You are the song I bleed (Oh-oh-oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
You are the war that I can't win
This is my white flag in the wind
Every word You speak (Oh-oh-oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Is the air I breathe
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)

I feel like a contender
Bringing my fist to pistol war
I surrender
That I need you now and You've loved me more
It's like an ocean over my head and I'm under the light
In slow mo-o-o-o-o-otion tonight
