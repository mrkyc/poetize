This whole city's black and white
Tell me what is your color
Could it be the same as mine?
Faded greens and blue street lights
There's a red fire burning
From the sea up to the sky

I don't want to wait until tomorrow
To tell you how I feel the rest of my life
You don't want a waste another minute when you realize
Walking on the dark side of the evening
Baby, it was you who opened my eyes
Burning like a fire on the water
In the city of black and white
Won't you just stay?
Won't you just stay?

I'm on the top still looking down
If you coming up to me
Is where the whole world wants to be found
Golden rings and coffee brown
There's a white flag waving
Where my heart is on the ground

Walking on the dark side of the evening
Baby, it was you that opened my eyes
Burning like a fire on the water

Won't you just stay?
Won't you just stay?

Won't you just stay now?
When the light glows under a dark street
No one else knows
So take my hand
I'll carry you, you can carry me

Won't you just stay now?
