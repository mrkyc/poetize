The ball will drop in New York soon
And everyone here is singin' along, yeah
All the lights they shine for you
You don't have to cry for me when I'm gone
(Don't cry love)

I held open the door, we drove away in the storm
Never felt it before, being shook to the core
'Cause we don't sleep anymore, we don't sleep anymore
Wakin' up on the floor, no we don't sleep anymore
(Don't cry love)
Drinkin' cheap champagne, you're always gone when you're paying
For a downtown love, on an uptown train
Yeah your heart's gonna break, your heart's gonna break
'Til they take it away

The ball will drop in New York soon
And everyone here is singin' along, yeah
All the lights they shine for you
You don't have to cry for me when I'm gone
Don't cry for me when I'm gone
(Don't cry, don't cry love)
Oh (don't cry)
Don't cry for me when I'm gone
(Don't cry, don't cry love, don't cry)

Young, dumb and afraid, in the springtime rains
Summer love went and came, almost blew us away

If you wanna stay young, baby don't be afraid
That your heart's gonna break, your heart's gonna break
'Til they take it away

The ball will drop in New York soon
And everyone here is singin' along, yeah
All the lights they shine for you
You don't have to cry for me when I'm gone
Don't cry for me when I'm gone
