And every word right from the start
I'll never let this love fall in the middle
'Cause you know you broke the hardest part
You know you broke the hardest heart
I'll never let this love fall in the middle
Through it all
Fifteen years old in a sea of blank faces
Swimming bold against a stream that's mocking as it races
In these halls, mountain high under a tangerine sky
Crack a smile just to hide the race that's inside
Eighteen years old bags packed and a pass for the rail
One last look at the past as it drowns in the hail
One in a million, still I keep feeling you keep me from a fall
A world to lose coming back with you tall
Through it all
No parachutes or safety nets here
One foot on the water to face these fears
I'm coming out strong like I can't be wrong
I said "Hey, I won't fall in the middle"
Twenty five here I am with freshman LPs
One life to write one, two years to repeat
Behind a curtain, uncertain if an encore's in store
Tuck my shoulder like a soldier to knock down the door
Thirty something here I'm running with kisses for one girl
These scars upon my sleeve still casting out my pearls
Throw each stone microphone like it's my last turn
With a kiss to the abyss and watch the ripples return
Through it all

One foot on the water to face these fears
I'm coming out strong like I can't be wrong
I said "Hey, I won't fall in the middle"
I said I'm gonna be alright, I'm gonna be alright
With you by my side
I said I'm gonna be alright, I'm gonna be alright
With you through this fight
Through it all
No parachutes or safety nets here
One foot on the water to face these fears
I'm coming out strong like I can't be wrong
I said "Hey, I won't fall in the middle"
I meant it all and every part
And every word right from the start
I'll never let this love fall in the middle
