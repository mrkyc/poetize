And all of your ways and all your thunder
Got me in a haze running for cover
Where we gonna go from here?
Where we gonna go from here?

Car lights in the driveway
I wonder who's going coming my way
Tomorrow we're turning down the highway
With another bright stage on a weekday
Green grass and a radio
Watching it fly past and away we go
Seven hundred places, seven hundred faces, one

And all of your ways and all your thunder
Got me in a haze running for cover
Where we gonna go from here?
Where we gonna go from here?
The back of your eyes look like my mother's
When we talk you're like my brother
Where we gonna go from here?
Where we gonna go from here?
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Time is moving on our side
How could I miss you to another guy
Pull of the ocean and the roaring tide
Is bigger than my eyes or my design
Father got a best plan
Saving the daughter for the best man
Seven hundred places, seven hundred faces, one

And alll of your ways and all your thunder
Got me in a haze running for cover
Where we gonna go from here?
Where we gonna go from here?
The back of your eyes look like my mother's
When we talk you're like my brother
Where we gonna go from here?
Where we gonna go from here?
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I've waited and I'll wait some more
Won't see me knocking on another door
But all this is crazy and amazing
There's only one half of us that I'm saving
So I'm praying just to let it go
Watch from a distance just to see you glow
Seven hundred places, seven hundred faces, one
And all of your ways and all your thunder
Got me in a haze running for cover
Where we gonna go from here?
Where we gonna go from here?
The back of your eyes look like my mother's
When we talk you're like my brother
Where we gonna go from here?
Where we gonna go from here?
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
