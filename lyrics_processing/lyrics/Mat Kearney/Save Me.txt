I've been on the run for half my life
Tryna tame the sun and raise the night
Over mountains and across the fields of gold
On my own
A man needs something he can hold on to
But that means nothing if he's scared to choose
If there's one thing that I can't lose
It's your love
Alone

Save me save me
Can't you hear me calling
I keep waiting waiting
For you to come and change me
Take me take me
Down to the river
Wash me in the water again
All the way down
Back to where my heart is
All the way round
Back to where we started

There's a gravity in your kiss
And galaxies in your fingertips
There's a fire burning on your lips
While my soul's runnin' cold

Oooooh
I'm tryna find your light
Tryna find your light
