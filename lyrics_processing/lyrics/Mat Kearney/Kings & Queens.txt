I don't need much with you, my love
'Cause the champagne drains and the airplane fame turns into rust
I don't need much with you, my love
Cause the Hollywood Hills won't ever make me feel as good as us
You got me singin'

We don't need no bankroll to make us feel alive
We don't need no Benzo, to feel like we can ride
Richer than Solomon with you by my side
We'll be kings and queens in our own mind
We don't need no jet plane to feel like we can fly
We don't need no gold chain just to watch it shine
24 karat lives, we don't got the time
We'll be kings and queens in our own mind

I got everything I'll ever need
You can cash every check try to buy a respect that's incomplete
I got everything I'll ever need
Don't gotta make it to the top yeah to know what I got
With you and me
You got me singin'

We don't need no bankroll to make us feel alive
We don't need no Benzo, to feel like we can ride
Richer than Solomon with you by my side
We'll be kings and queens in our own mind
We don't need no jet plane feel like we can fly
We don't need no gold chain just to watch it shine
24 karat lives, we don't got the time
We'll be kings and queens in our own mind
