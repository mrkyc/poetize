Waiting on a phone that never calls, at all
Heartbreak comes rollin' in like a storm, sooner or later
Trying to swim but your sinking like a stone, alone
And I can feel fire in the night waiting here
Baby, it's like we're walking on a wire thru the fear
Take my hand, we'll get there
Sooner or later, I swear we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it
Sooner or later, I swear we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it
Milk and honey till we get our fill
I'll keep chasing it, I always will
Sooner or later, I swear we'll make it there
Sooner than later, sooner or later
Sooner than later, sooner or later
We're all waiting on dream
That's hard to own, sooner or later
Trying to feel the high
Without the low, you know
You can feel fire in the night lying here
Baby, it's like we're walking on a wire through the fear
Take my hand, we'll get there
