(Yeah, yeah)
Nashville is burning tonight
You turn me right round, baby like a forty-five
And I'm feeling every song that this town could write
(Yeah, yeah)
Old fire in my head
And a drummer in my chest
Just take one look in my eyes and they will confess

That you got me feeling so high (yeah, yeah)
That you are the rhythm of my life, my life

I feel your heart beat, beat, beat
Beating right next to me
The heat, heat, heat
Got me feeling like I believe
All the things, baby, that we could be
I feel your heart beat, beat, beat
Beating right next to me
Beating right next to me
Beating right next to me

I feel your heart beat
(Yeah, yeah)
I feel your heart beat
(Yeah, yeah)
I feel your heart beat
(Yeah, yeah)
Heart beat, your heart beat
