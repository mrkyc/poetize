We were young, we were brave
With our eyes wide shut in the choices we made
Well you lit the match and I got caught with the flames
And your voice still rings out through my mind
And the thorns still twist down in my side
All the promises said that we left for dead in the night (woo woo)

Because I'm moving on, letting go
Forget the past
I'm giving up the ghost
All we are is fading stars, life's too short to stay where we are

Forgive, let live and move on tell me that you're gonna make me stronger
Forgive, let live and move on (woo)
Forgive, let live and move on tell me that you're gonna make me stronger
Forgive, let live and move on (woo)

Maybe I'm broken, maybe it's the fame
Maybe it's the moment you said I had changed
Where did thirteen years go like I didn't know you at all? (woo woo)

Because I'm moving on, letting go
Forget the past
I'm giving up the ghost
All we are is fading stars, life's too short to stay where we are

When bridges are burning in accusation
Funny how time is the great revelation (woo)
