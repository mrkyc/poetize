You're my favorite kind of trouble
'Cause there ain't no love without the struggle
If it all turns to rubble
We put each other back like a puzzle

Oh, no matter what, I'll keep on loving you
Oh, no matter what
Oh, no matter what, I'll keep on loving you
Oh, no matter what

My little Spanish speaking heart bleeding firecrackers
Senorita, rita, rita
Doing your silent treatment on the couch with a frown
Oh how I need ya, need ya, need ya
I'm sittin' stubborn 'cause I know that you're right
You're sittin' pretty 'cause ya picked the fight
And we're both swearin' not to bend 'til we win
But I can't stay mad at you that long
Five minutes I'll be back in your arms
I'm always comin' back to you in the end 'cause

Oh, no matter what, I'll keep on loving you
Oh, no matter what (I'll keep on loving you)
Oh, no matter what, I'll keep on loving you
Oh, no matter what

Stupid things, we disagree
When we both hear two different things
If love is war, I'll play for keeps
Cause I need ya, I need ya, I need ya

Doing your silent treatment on the couch with a frown
Oh how I need ya, need ya, need ya
