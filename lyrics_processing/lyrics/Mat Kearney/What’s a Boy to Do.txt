Three long years wandering in New York City
I guess I'm looking for the right way to do this
I guess I'm looking for the right things to call pretty
Young boys playing in the park turning their backs to take a shot
You know I'll stay sharp around here 'cause they're stoning and leaving type
It's the kind of love that comes and goes when there's company coming 'round
What's a boy to do who knows no man now?
What's a boy to do who knows no man now?
Daddy's been looking down his nose at all of them
And I've been looking around for someone to tell me who I am
He kept saying I was too young to finish a fight
I'd die each time they came, I never got to draw my knife
Well it was just a pair of shoes in a middle school room with the world watching in
And Angela's crying I'm dying just a little inside as they ran away
Funny which words stick around 20 years down when you're driving alone
What's a boy to do when there's no man at home?
What's a boy to do when there's no man at home?
Well I'll stack all my books in perfect rows
From the biggest down to the smallest ones
And I buy all the perfect clothes
Bulletproof in black, where I look like a son

A bottle spinning 'round the room
And everybody's singing and slipping down the bottom of a halfway rush of blood
And I was grabbing Missy but I was trying to find the light switch in the dark
What's a boy to do with no man in his heart?
What's a boy to do with no man in his heart?
It's all quiet for the first time
With no voices left to fall
I saw a boy at the bottom of the bridge
Car was left there on the top
It's four o'clock in the morning
Didn't need to be like this
There's a white sheet left to cover up
What should have been a holy kiss
It's not like those days
It's not like I'm scared of you
What's the son of man and a boy to do?
