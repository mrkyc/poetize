Did you close your eyes as you walked away
Did I get too close in the pouring rain
If there's one more chance for us here tonight
I'll take the long way round this time
And we sing

Oh love it's easy if you don't try to please me
If you don't want to see me anymore
We sing now

Oh oh, here we go again
I know how I lost a friend
We go round and round again
Oh oh, oh oh

How bitter is the kiss that says goodbye
I could hear it in your voice and see it in your eyes
Cause we've been this low and we've been round this bend
I don't want to lose you all over again
And we sing

Oh love it's easy if you don't try to please me
If you don't want to see me anymore
We sing now

I know how I lost a friend
We go round and round again

Round here hey hey
We got a light
Thats not going away
If all is broken and all is lost
Then I've been found
So here's my heart I'll give it all over again
Here we go, yeah
Here we go again
Here we go again
Here we go again

Oh oh, here we go again
I know how I lost a friend
We go round and round again
Oh oh, oh oh
It's a long road baby running away
It's a long road baby running away
It's a long road baby running away
