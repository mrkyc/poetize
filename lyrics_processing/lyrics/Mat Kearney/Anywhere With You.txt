I've been lost on the train
With a west found gold
Tossed and turned in the waves
Down a dead end road
Lost my mind on purpose
To find my soul
Found there's only so much
You wanna see alone

And I can picture your silhouette
In the summer of no regrets
It felt like a thousand breaths a thousand steps
I knew right then and there that

I'd go anywhere with you
I'd go anywhere with you
I know you feel the same thing that I do
'Cause I'd go anywhere, anywhere with you
Anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere with you
Anywhere, anywhere

I slept under the pines and they sang your name
Stared at the stars in the night and I saw your face

And I can picture your silhouette
I sway in the sunset
It feels like a thousand breaths a thousand steps
I know right here and now that

I'd go anywhere with you
I'd go anywhere with you
I know you feel the same thing that I do
'Cause I'd go anywhere, anywhere with you

We were humming out the window
Knowin' where the wind blows
Cough on cigars in the stars
I'll be at a rooftop till the cops came
And I know that I was changed
Playing jokes on the people below
And I know that we'll never be the same
No we'll never be the same

'Cause I'd go anywhere with you
I'd go anywhere with you
I know you feel the same thing that I do
'Cause I'd go anywhere, anywhere with you
I'd go anywhere with you
I'd go anywhere with you
I know you feel the same thing that I do
'Cause I'd go anywhere, anywhere with you
Anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere, anywhere with you
Anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere, anywhere
