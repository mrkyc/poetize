I woke up this morning to a blood red sky
They're burning on the bridge, turning off the lights
We're on the run, I can see it in your eyes
If nothing is safe then I don't understand
You call me your boy but I'm trying to be the man
One more day and it's all slipping with the sand
You touch my lips and grab the back of my hand
The back of my hand

Guess we both know we're in over our heads
We got nowhere to go and no home that's left
The water is rising on a river turning red
It all might be okay or we might be dead
If everything we've got is slipping away
I meant what I said when I said 'til my dying day
I'm holding on to you, holding on to me
Maybe it's all gone black but you're all I see
You're all I see

The walls are shaking, I hear them sound the alarm
Glass is breaking so, don't let go of my arm
Grab your bags and a picture of where we met
All that we'll leave behind and all that's left
If everything we've got is blowing away
We've got a rock and a rock 'til our dying day
I'm holding on to you, holding on to me
Maybe it's all we got but it's all I need
You're all I need

I know I love you, if that's all we can take
The tears are coming down, they're mixing with the rain
I know I love you, if that's all we can take
A pool is running for miles on the concrete ground
We're eight feet deep and the rain is still coming down
The TV's playing it all out of town
