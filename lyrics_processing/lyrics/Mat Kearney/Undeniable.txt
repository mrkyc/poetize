In an unreliable world you shine like a star
It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
It's unmistakable that you're undeniable
February 5th, Friday morning, purple dawn
Broke a yawn, as I stepped through the fog, like I stepped to a song
A moment like a poem, you wish you could hold it
I shut my eyes like it's frozen, it's gone when I open
It slipped past the clouds right there where it lingered
Like your band and a girl could slip through your fingers
My feet hit the ground like a beat for the lonely
On a path beaten down by the crowds in the morning
If only I could touch past the phony
If only they were there now to hold me
As the questions keep droning
You're the only one who stuck it out last night
The only other one who caught the other line
You're the only one when this world collides
The one that I can't deny
It's undeniable how brilliant you are
In an unreliable world you shine like a star
It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
It's unmistakable that you're undeniable

My first class moved to portable 'A'
Under construction since summer
And it's cold today
I can see my breath, and what's left of the west parking lot
And all the spaces that we fought
And it all seems forgotten, left in the bottom
In past piles of rubble, in puddles of rain water
That hurt last night when I left like that
When I won't come back
Speaking my peace to the past
I can't help but wonder. who is this wind at my back
A whisper to walk on, come on from all that
You're the only one who stuck it out last night
The only other one who caught the other line
You're the only one when this world collides
The one that I can't deny
It's undeniable how brilliant you are
In an unreliable world you shine like a star
It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
It's unmistakable that you're undeniable
How am I gonna take it away in this winter wind
You found me on a summer breeze
How am I gonna run away when the autumn breaks
Now that you found me in the spring
Come on and sing it out
It's undeniable how brilliant you are
In an unreliable world you shine like a star
It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
It's unmistakable that you're undeniable
It's undeniable how brilliant you are
In an unreliable world you shine like a star
It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
