Cause it was Bell Biv DeVoe, playing on my radio
And I had Wu-Tang Clan living in my stereo
Mama said we're 6th generation Oregonians
I was rocking them Jordans with reflector tongues
Two kids with wet cement living down in their souls
They say what gets caught when you're young stays there when you're old
So misunderstood they say, you're up to no good
And now we're trying our best to start it over again

If I'd had met you at the playground
Before a hand could tear your world down
Before I slammed down the door and
You said I'm just like my old man
Before I put you in those boxes
And we learned how to disagree
And how your family is a rocket
That blows up in infidelity

For crying out loud I wanna know
How the waves keep on crashing down the doors
Feel the weight of the world and they keep on bringing more
If it's just you and me on the floor
Go grab your coat and I'll drive us home
Like we were just kids
Just, j-j-just kids
J-j-just kids, just, just kids
Like we were just kids
Just kids, j-j-just kids
J-j-j-just kids, j-j-just kids

Bob Marley was painted on my high school walls
But I just disappeared into the darkroom hall
Never thought I'd ever make it quite this far
Teacher put up my photographs, say "son you'll be a star"
It was smoke and mirrors, running down through my veins
I kept on running downtown, running from God's grace
Every morning I'd climb back through those window panes
And try my best to ride it out over instrumental tapes

If I'd had met you at the playground
Before a hand could tear your world down
Before I slammed down the door and
You said I'm just like my old man
Before I put you in those boxes
And we learned how to disagree
And how your family is a rocket
That blows up in infidelity

For crying out loud I wanna know
How the waves keep on crashing down the doors
Feel the weight of the world and they keep on bringing more
If it's just you and me on the floor
Go grab your coat and I'll drive us home
Like we were just kids
Just, j-j-just kids
J-j-just kids, just, just kids
Like we were just kids
Just kids, j-j-just kids
J-j-j-just kids, j-j-just kids
I can feel it in the way we try
I can feel it in the way we fight
We're standing side by side
Like we were just kids
I can feel it in the way we try
I can feel it in the way we fight
We're standing side by side
Like we were just kids
I can feel it in the way we try
I can feel it in the way we fight
We're standing side by side
Like we were just kids
I can feel it in the way we try
I can feel it in the way we fight
We're standing side by side
