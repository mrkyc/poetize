Tonight you're letting go
Under the burning glow
We're too young to hold this all on our own
Autumn came and went, riding them violent winds
Blowing through the trees, you can feel it on your skin
Walking the lost streets, no one ever shares
Cry yourself to sleep, waiting on a little prayer
Bags are by the door
Hearts are on the floor
There's a bottle full of tears on the dresser drawer

Nobody know the trouble we seen and
Nobody know the price of this dream and
Nobody knows what it took to believe
Nobody

She wants to be free
Like a runaway, ay, ay, ay
Tryna' believe
Gonna find a way, ay, ay, ay, ay
We got just one life
Tonight we're running all the lights
Tryna' break free
Like a runaway, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

The road below our wheels, all that we fought to heal
You close your eyes and cry, dying for the right to feel
I hear it coming down
Oh, the sweetest sound
Of forgotten tears fallin' on the solid ground

Nobody know the trouble we seen and
Nobody know the price of this dream and
Nobody knows what it took to believe
Nobody

She wants to be free
Like a runaway, ay, ay, ay
Tryna' believe
Gonna find a way, ay, ay, ay, ay
We got just one life
Tonight we're running all the lights
Tryna' break free
Like a runaway, ay, ay, ay, ay

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
We're singing, "How did we get this far
Riding on a shooting star?"
It's like flying on the wings of God
She wants to be free
Like a runaway, ay, ay, ay
Tryna' believe
Gonna find a way, ay, ay, ay, ay
We got just one life tonight
We're running all the lights
Tryna' break free
