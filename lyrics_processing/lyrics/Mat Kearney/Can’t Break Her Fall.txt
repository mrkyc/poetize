I know there's never gonna be an easy way out
She's rolling round the town with a fast gun
And I know I can't be there to catch her when she falls
Well half way down is half way out of here
We're either halfway drowned or half way 'round the pier
When you're that far gone
I walked the steps to her apartment with the window by the shore
And saw her curled on the tile through a crack in the door
I've been searching for the words I don't know how to say
I've been searching for the words to make it go away
I spent all of last night and the night before that
With my feet in the sand and the wind on my back
Watching a ship sail out to a blue wide sea
There must be more than this with a kiss we can't see
Well half way down is half way out of here
We're either half way drowned or half way round the pier
I can't break her, I can't break her fall
She's lying in the back room, crying on the bathroom floor
Singing I can't take it, I can't take any more
Just one reason, one to believe in
That's not that far gone
Not that far gone

And watched the sheets raise and fall to the rhythm of her breath
Turn the lock on the handle and slipped down the stairs
To the cover of the night with diamonds in the air
I'll say a prayer in my breath and take a left at the water
To the rhythm of my feet a sister and a daughter
To the rhythm of the sea with the breeze in the autumn
As it blows through the trees my hands into the water
Well half way down is half way out of here
We're either half way drowned or half way round the pier
I can't break her, I can't break her fall
She's lying in the back room, crying on the bathroom floor
Singing I can't take it, I can't take any more
Just one reason, one to believe in
That's not that far gone
Not that far gone
I can't break her, I can't break her fall
She's lying in the back room, crying on the bathroom floor
And I can't take it, I can't take anymore
She says today is gonna be the last time
