When black man want to start business, na big wahala
Na big wahala, he go run orisirisi running
When he start the business nko? Another wahala
Another wahala, he go beg orisirisi begging
To settle wahala, na to start wahala again

And things don come change again
Soldier don put everybody for reverse
Na back the country take dey walk
Soldier don put everybody for reverse
Na back the country take dey walk
