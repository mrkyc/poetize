Feels like the same today
10,000 horses drag me down
Seems like the same, you say
10,000 voices crying out
You put on yourself, you'll see
There's nothing left at all, left at all
10,000 fingers dragging me down, down, down

Never want to slow down
I keep rollin' on
Never want to slow down
What I feel and what I know
Oh, it's about to change, about to change
About to change, about to change

Seems like the same, your ways of moving on
10,000 lies, you're washing your hands of everything else
So put on yourself, you'll see
There's nothing left at all
10,000 stares, they're bringing me down, down, down

Never want to slow down
I keep rollin' on
Never want to slow down
What I feel and what I know
Oh, it feels like the strain
That everybody's giving to me
Won't let my hands get tied
I'm gonna ride it all out
Never gonna slow down this time
Oh, it's all about to...
About to change, about to change
About to change, about to change
You might also like
About to change from the past for knowledge tomorrow
Carries me on my way
I feel you pressing, these words left unspoken
Change for the sake, change for the sake of change


Seems like the same, you say
10,000 cracks you're walking on
Feels like the same to say
10,000 voices calling on
You put on yourself, you'll see
There's nothing left at all
10,000 horses bringing me down, down, down

Never want to slow down
I keep rollin' on
Never want to slow down
What I feel and what I know
Oh, it feels like the strain
That everybody's giving to me
Won't let my hands get tied
I'm gonna ride it all out
Never gonna slow down this time
Oh, it's all about to...
About to change, about to change
About to change, about to change
About to...
About to change, about to change
