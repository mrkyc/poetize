Prison bars inside our homes
Gone way too far this time
It's skin on skin for skin tonight
And I stand in plain sight
I watch it drown
Where the fires burn right beside
They'll burn it to the ground
And we'll never know

Paper plates and dinner trays
Stacked away, stomach groans
To see you see the sight of me
Would surely break my bones
I wash it down
And the fires burned bright outside
My house it's not a home
And we'll never know

Under these spotlights down on the streets I roam
I'm looking for prophets born from these broken homes
And under this sunshine revealed your brilliant cast
If you never burn bright, if you never take flight you're always looking back
You might also like
Swept away from holidays
Had to learn to play pretend
A list to list a list of things
I wish that I could send
I toss it out
The "once upon a time" for you never reached this blighted home
You'll never know
And you'll never know
You'll never know

Under these spotlights down on the streets I roam
I'm looking for prophets born from these broken homes
And under this sunshine revealed your brilliant cast
If you never burn bright, if you never take flight you're always looking back

Momma said goodnight, tried her best to keep you warm
The cold outside it broke her down
The fire gone, papa left so long ago
And it's been so long, and it's been so long
Wonder who you have to blame
Sitting under this spotlight you find yourself ready for the change

Prison bars inside our home
Went way too far that night
Was skin on skin for skin my son
And you stood in plain sight
Looking for spotlights down on the streets I roam
I'm looking for prophets born from these broken homes
And under this sunshine revealed your brilliant cast
If you never burn bright, if you never take flight you're always looking back
Always looking back
Always looking back
Under spotlight
Under spotlight
Under spotlight
Under spotlight
Under spotlight
