She says lately I've been runnin blind
I've been losing sleep
And I wanna come home
And your loneliness makes me wanna be with you
The pleasure high inside of me babe
I've been rollin on this road too long to come home
Too long to come home
Too long to come home
Oh, there's just something you got about you baby
Oh, you're never gonna know
The summertime you make me feel right
There's something in my heart baby
You're turning me on and on
And it makes me wanna come undone
And it feels like lightnin's wasting time for you
Counting the day's till I'm gonna be struck
You're my lover, babe
Rollin' on and on and on
Oh, there's just something you got about you baby
Oh, you'll never see what I see
Oh, you're the gravity pullin me out of this bed
Oh, you're never gonna know
Oh
I can't keep from roaming on
And I wait for years
Yes, I wait by the road
I just keep roaming on
And I yearn for my love
And I wanna come home
You're my
You're my sweet sweet summertime lover
You're my sweet sweet summertime love
You're my sweet sweet summertime lover
Sweet sweet summertime
The daylight sun makes me wanna feel right
You say lately I've been runnin blind, babe
I've been losing sleep
And I wanna come home
And it feels like lightnin's wasting time for you
Counting the day's till I'm gonna be struck
You're my lover, babe
Rollin' on and on and on
Oh, there's just something you got about you baby
Oh, you're never gonna know
Oh, you're the gravity pullin me out of this bed
Oh, you'll never see what I see
Oh you're my
You're my sweet sweet summertime lover
You're my sweet sweet summertime love
You're my sweet sweet summertime lover
You'll never see what I see
You're my sweet sweet summertime lover
You're my sweet sweet summertime love
