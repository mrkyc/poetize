Quiet down now, hush hush my friend
When all the others left, when all the others left
When all the others left, when all the others...
I know you'd stick around, come here now
I know you'd stick around, come here now
When all the others talked, when all the others talked
When all the others talked, when all the others...
You'd always been my habit now
Colored bees, and stomach aches
Your friend's in need, and lovers quakes
My best friend, my, my very best friend
My best friend, my, she never left my side
So come here now sit. Quiet down. Come here now sit
Quiet down now, quiet down friend...
When all the others left, when all the others left
When all the others left, when all the others...
I knew you'd stick around, come here now
When all the others talked, when all the others talked
When all the others talked, when all the others...
You'd always been my habit now
Colored bees, and stomach aches
Your friend's in need, and lovers quakes
My best friend, my, my very best friend
My best friend, my, she never left my side
So come here now sit. Quiet down. Come here now sit
So lie down now, quiet down friend
Lie down now, lie down now sit
My side so lie down and fight to find
My side so lie down and fight for my
My side so lie down, be good for my
My side so lie down, be good for my
Quiet down now, hush hush my friend
Cone here now, come here now sit
When all the others left, I knew you'd stick around
When all the others talked, I knew you'd stick around
Lie down now, lie down my friend
Lie down now, hush hush my friend
My best friend, my, my very best friend
