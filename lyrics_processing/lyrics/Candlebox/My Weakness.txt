She's the, she's the hard stuff
A dive into a wishing well
Make your peace, a prayer before you start to spill
She's a lie you know you're gonna have to sell
So shut, so shut your mind up
The time for second guessing's gone
You try pretending she's a never-ending cyclone
You wanna live just a little bit before you're done

Baby, self-medicated another lost weekend
You're the side effect and I'm your drama witness
You know that you're my weakness
Maybe, we're overrated
So throw me in the deep end
I need sedating and I'm your drama witness
You know that you're my weakness
You know that you're my weakness

She's a, she's a pill pop
A temporary pleasure pull
Make your knees drop
Swearing up and down you will
Never ever stop trying to roll a rock uphill
She's the, she's the hard stuff
You dive into a wishing well
Make your peace, a prayer before you start to spill
She's a lie you know you're gonna have to sell

Baby, self-medicated another lost weekend
You're the side effect and I'm your drama witness
You know that you're my weakness
Maybe, we're overrated
So throw me in the deep end
I need sedating and I'm your drama witness
You know that you're my weakness
You know that you're my weakness

Spinnin' round and round, barely off the bottom
Going down, down, slowly turnin' rotten
We're spinnin' round and round and barely off the bottom
You know that you're my weakness

So baby, self-medicated another lost weekend
You're the side effect and I'm your drama witness
You know that you're my weakness
Maybe, we're overrated
So throw me in the deep end
I need sedating and I'm your drama witness
Oh, You know that you're my weakness
