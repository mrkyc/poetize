Somehow he thought you'd be there
Help him beat me down, again. It's all I know
So you want for me, some things we never see
Left alone to fill time
So empty all your thoughts now, turn around your hate
Take a look at me. Hang on security
It's all been overrated, this life you live, it's not your own
There no one here to help you
It's all been unadulterated lies, they'll keep telling you
They'll keep telling you, how I want to...
Raise it on my own, nothing special maybe, nothing special lately
Time to feel it on your own, time you want to take control
So you've told them all, I though you looked the same!
Do you need this light to help you see it clearer again
Closer to my letter, open up for some to breed
You're sharper these days roll on security
It's all been overrated, this life to live, it's not your own
There's no one here to help you
And it's all been unadulterated lies, they'll keep telling you
They keep telling you, how I want to...
Raise it on my own, nothing special lately, nothing special maybe
Time to feel it on your own, time you want to take control
No now fall, call for me to fall for
Everybody wants to tell you something
Everybody wants to fill your, nothing
Everybody wants to break you out now
Everybody wants to take you out now
And everybody wants to tell you
And everybody wants to fill you in
Do you think it's time to tell them?
Yes I think it's time you shove them a little harder
Yes I think it's time that you pushed them over
Don't you think it's time you told them stop!
Raise it on my own no, no time to feel your soulless lately
Everybody wants to tell you something
Everybody wants to bring you something
Everybody wants to take you
And everybody wants to bring you down
Time you feel it in your own, time you let them take control
Time you fill their needs, so empty all your thoughts my friends
For everybody wants to break you
