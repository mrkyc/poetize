Your role it played through time
Come and rescue me
You're needed here at home
And your space, a moment in time
A hand to hold a hand I tried
Who was it called to you?
Who called?
Your stories alive with hellos and goodbyes
And bright lights, first kiss and drunken nights
How I miss you
I miss you now and
Hey, I can't wait another day
And hey, that crooked smile upon your face
Oh, they'll never get old
All the stories you told
From the beach to the ring
To the songs of your soul
How I miss you
I miss you now and hey
And the rain
Falling cold outside
Covered me the day you died
You could have waited one more day
And I should've called
I dream of your life, the war and the fight
The music you played, the love for your wife
And I miss you
Hmm mmm
You might also likeI miss you now and
Hey, I can't wait another day
And hey, that crooked smile upon your face
Oh, they'll never get old
All the stories you told
From the beach to the ring
To the songs of your soul
How I miss you
I miss you now and hey
(Bridge:)
And I'm mad at the age
That stole you away
By surviving that beach
You gave me my stay
And I understand by this that I am
All that you were was changed by that sand
But I miss you yeah
I miss you yeah
And I miss you, yeah
And hey, I can't wait another day
And hey, that crooked smile upon your face
Oh, they'll never get old
All the stories you told
From the beach to the ring
To the songs of your soul
How I miss you
