Friends seem to see you
Friends seem to feel you
Does anybody else know?
I'm bailing you out of this life
Take another glance
Then close your eyes
Have you got more to say?
Painting outside the lines
Come another day will you get it right?
Well there's something I should say

Leave it all decide to walk away
Won't you leave it all decide to walk away
In time you'll find your own

I can see your blinders in the way
I'm so much closer than you know now
Can you feel me?
I can see your blinders in the way
Time to open up and let go

Filling the shoes this time
Turn another page, it's just a sign
That you're needed in my life
Drawing inside the pain
Could take another day to wash away
Well there's still time to fly
You might also like
Leave it all decide to walk away
Leave it all decide to walk away
In time you'll find you're not alone

I can see your blinders in the way
I'm so much closer than you know now
Can you feel me?
I can see your blinders in the way
Time to open up and let go

Caught up outside the light
When you gonna want and realign
Friend I can see you
Friend I can still feel you
Do you feel alone today?
Oh my friend
Do you need me?
Friend do you fear me?
We need to be the same

Leave it all decide to walk away
Leave it all decide to walk away
In time you'll find you're not alone
I can see your blinders in the way
I'm so much closer than you know now
Can you fell me?
I can see your blinders in the way
Time to open up and let go

Caught up outside the light
