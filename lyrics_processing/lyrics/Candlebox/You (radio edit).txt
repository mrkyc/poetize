And shudder

Steal another dime
Take another line
Won't you feel it
Blanket your soul
Out of mind
Come around town
Steal another dime
Do another crime
Won't you get it higher and higher
All through time
Come around town
Steal another dime

Feeling fine
Don't you push your drugs in my face
Or I'm gonna put you in your place
Fuck you

And it's mine
Said this pain in my heart is all mine
Yes, it's mine all alone

Pain in my heart, it is real
And I'll take
Everything as it comes my way
Feel in my heart it's for you
And I'll lie for you as I die for you
Pain in my heart it is real
And I'll tell you now
How I feel inside
Fuck you
