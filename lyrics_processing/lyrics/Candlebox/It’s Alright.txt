It's alright what you confess to me
Where you're at right now baby, it's alright with me
Behind your truths or somewhere inside your lies
These long cold days of gray, they color your eyes

And it's alright, what you confide in me
Where we're at right now baby, it's where we need to be
And I can see things so clearly through tear-stained eyes
The side effects of time in all our good-byes, and it's alright

I got lost some time ago
Lost in your song, your touch, your smile
And where I want to grow old
And you glimmer and gleam like a blond-washed hair from an ocean-side domain
Drifting into me, I found myself again, in her song

It's alright what you say to me
How you feel right now baby, shows an everlasting need
Behind the truth, there's something inside your lies
These long cold days of rain, they're hiding your eyes
And it's alright, what you express to me
Your song escapes me to this place I want to be
So sing to me baby, your song can carry me
Through endless weeks of rain and onto sweeter things
You might also like
And it's alright
I got lost some time ago
Lost in your song, your touch, your smile
And where I want to grow old
And you glimmer and gleam like a blond-washed hair from an ocean-side domain
Drifting into me, I found myself again, in her song

Oh sing to me baby, your song can carry me
In all she's revealed I found I could always see
How her ways could flow and run over me
And I found this reason to learn
And I found this reason to decide
As many days come and many days go
I'll never know why

And it's alright
I got lost some time ago
Lost in your song, your touch, your smile
And where I want to grow old
And you glimmer and gleam like a blond-washed hair from an ocean-side domain
