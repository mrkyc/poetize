You took some time to come to mind
I must admit I was all right but there you were
Right there you were
And I can't shake you from inside
(And I can't shake you from inside)
A thousand years could pass us by
I must admit I'll still be lost, I'll still be broken there you were
Right there you were
And I can't shake you from my mind, no
(And I can't shake you from inside)

I'm crazy for this moment
I'm crazy for your love
So crazy, I admit, the stupid things I've done
I'm crazy for the tension
Crazy for the buzz
So crazy thinking I could take you like the sweetest drug

It took some time to figure out
I must admit I made it hard but there you were right there you were
And I can fare this battleground
(And I can fare this battleground)
Ten thousand years could pass us by
I will admit I'll still be lost, I'll still be broken there you were
Right there you were
My confidant, my sweet ally
(My confidant, my sweet ally)
