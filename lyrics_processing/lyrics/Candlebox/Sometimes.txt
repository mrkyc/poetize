And I wipe the night from my eyes
Block out that sunny day and I
And everything is falling down around us
Just missing the rain yeah
And I'm happier now today
But don't let me down, don't let me go
A change of seasons inside of my
In time I'll decide, in time I'll decide to move on

Change directions, watch the tides
And we borrow too much
And form restrictions, we form lines
And we separate you from me
But sometimes
Sometimes we carry more weight than we own
Oh sometimes
And sometimes goes on

And night takes the light by the hand
And turns out that boring day yeah
And cries out loud
Never once, hanging on
Hanging on my words
Kills the feeling of being alive
And she's happier now today
Don't let her down, don't let her go
Found no reasons
We found no lies
We just bleed together
That's how we realize and we
You might also like
Change directions, watch the tides
And we borrow too much
And form restrictions, we form lines
And we separate you from me
But sometimes
Sometimes we carry more weight than we own
Oh sometimes
And sometimes goes on and on and on

And somehow we'll find a way
We'll paste it back together
These ripped out pages of old coloring books
Your gold is silver
My blue is grey
It's all held together by cellophane tape

If we change directions, watch the tides
And we borrow too much
And form restrictions, we form lines
And we separate you from me
But sometimes
Sometimes we carry more weight than we own
Oh sometimes
And sometimes goes on and on and on'..
In my head I've got everything I want
And In my head I've got everything I want
And In my head I've got everything I want
