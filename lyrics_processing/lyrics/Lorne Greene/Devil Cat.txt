When the wind whistles high in the lonesome pine and the sun is setting red and low
Way up on the ridge rides a lone cowhand been-a riding since a long time ago

For he threw his loop on a mountain cat when he found it was stalkin' the herd
They both headed out for the high-ground there's never been another word

Well the soul of Satan was in that cat, just a spitting ball of fire
That cowboy was tough as a brahman bull
He figured he'd earn his hire
He's been riding that mountaintop through the sun, rain, and hail
When they tried to track him they had no luck, they never found his trail

When the wind whistles high in the lonesome pine and the sun is setting red and low
Way up on the ridge rides a lone cowhand been-a riding since a long time ago

Now that cowboy, he sure was no saintly cuss
He knew the worst of old Satan's ways
There'd never be a round-up in the sky at the end of his earthbound days
Sure his loop was tied to the devil's hide
But his chances were getting mighty slim
'Cause the one thing that cowpoke did not know
Was that devil cat was sent to get him

When the wind whistles high in the lonesome pine and the sun is setting red and low
Way up on the ridge rides a lone cowhand been-a riding since a long time ago

And now when the shadows begin to fall
On the ridge you'll see them roar by
And straining the rope from that saddle horn
Is a cat with bloodshot eye
But unless that cat gives up the ghost
Forever that cowboy will ride
And only when Gabriel blows his horn
Will that devil cat will be dogged and tied

When the wind whistles high in the lonesome pine and the sun is setting red and low
Way up on the ridge rides a lone cowhand been-a riding since a long time ago
