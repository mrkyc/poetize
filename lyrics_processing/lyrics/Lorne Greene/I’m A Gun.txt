And I wondered what shape I would be
I was hard, I was cold, I was just a day old
And I wondered what future I'd see
Then a rough pair of hands fashioned pieces of steel
And a handle of smooth silky wood
And an arm held me out
While the eye of the man kept staring as hard as he could
I was fitted with bullets, with jackets of steel
And then taken outside in the light
Then he aimed me direct at a man on a horse
And his hands squeezed me tighter than tight
A bursting of fire exploded inside me sent flying a comet of heat
As the smoke cleared the way
I could see straight ahead the man who layed dead in the street
I'm a gun, I'm a gun
Til the day that man destroys me, I'm a gun
It's not the gun that kills a man
It's the man who fires the gun that kills a man
It's not the gun that kills a man
I tried to call out but my steel has no tongue
And to men, I am only a slave
I've never forgotten that terrible day
And that man that I couldn't save
No one knows what it means to be held in a hand
To be pointed and triggered to kill
To be labeled a gun with no power to stop
All the blood that man shooting will spill
You might also likeIt's a pity a man cannot live to the age of a mountain, the desert, or the sea
Only then would he learn
That to kill or be killed
Wasn't something that needed to be
Maybe someday, somehow when all men will meet
They will bury their guns in the ground
I hope they bury me, deep, so deep that I'll never be found
I'm a gun, I'm a gun
Til the day that man destroys me, I'm a gun
It's not the gun that kills a man
It's the man who fires the gun that kills a man
It's not the gun that kills a man
