The bar room was quiet, and smoke filled the air
A young fellow lay dying, with no one to care
I held him in my arms, a sad sight to see
Hear my story, he said, 'fore you bury me
When I was a boy I saw my father die
By the gun of a man with a scar across his eye
And I swore that when I was full grown
That I'd kill that man with a gun of my own
(I'd kill that man with a gun of my own)

I spent the years working, working day and night
Learning how to shoot, and learning how to fight
The word got around, oh it was known by all
They knew I drew fast, they knew I stood tall
When the time was right, I left my town
To search for the man that gunned my pa down
I rode through the night, I rode without stop
I rode without rest, 'till I thought I would drop

Then I heard that a man with a scar had been seen
In some God-forsook town, north of Abilene
I knew at last, I would see justice done
And if pa was alive, he'd be proud of his son
When I rode through that town, every man turned away;
They could see by my face there was devil to pay
I got off my horse and went into the bar
And standing right there was the man with the scar
(Standing right there was the man with the scar)

He looked straight at me, my mouth went dust-dry
He said, "What is it son?" I said, "You're gonna die!"
But as I went for my gun, a bullet hit my chest
And the last thing I saw was a star on his vest

That was the story he whispered to me
It's funny how foolish some men can be
And strange, I thought, as I buried him that day
