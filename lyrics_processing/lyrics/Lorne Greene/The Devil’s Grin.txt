To hide the mortal sin
Of shooting down another man
Who has no chance to win
Many men have seen it
They'll never see it again
That smiling mask that watched them die
It's called, the Devil's grin

The Devil's grin
The Devil's grin
I've worn a star a long long time
Though it's not so long in years
When you use a gun you count the time and hours
In blood and fears
My reputation says I'm fast
The fastest gun around
And that's why those who break the law
Don't hang around my town
But looking down and straight at me
Like a statue carved of stone
Was the smiling face of an evil man
Like none I'd ever known
You might also likeHe touched his hat politely
Bid the time of day to me
But all the time deep in his eyes
I saw taunting me

The Devil's grin
The hackles on my neck stood up
For in his eyes I saw
That he neither lacked the courage
Nor the willingness to draw
It wasn't like the times before
I'd played this deadly game
With some fast reputation
Or an outlaw with a name
This man just hung around the town
I watched, he did no wrong
Inside I knew he'd come for me
But when, where, how long?
He was clever, he asked questions
Where there a ranch to buy?
He made the people like him
With a smile that meant I'd die
The Devil's grin
I knew I had to force his hand
There was no need to pretend
I trapped him in a game of cards
There could only be one end
I called him cheat and shot him down
Knowing that I would win
And my face in the mirror
Behind the bar, was wearing
The Devil's grin

The Devil's grin
