I wish I could drown it out, yeah (Yeah)
But it's never over
We keep going round for round, yeah (Yeah)

And I know, I know, I know it's fading out
But I keep the candle burning 'til the end
Don't you forget that we used to be best of friends, my friend (No)

Love, don't let me go, save me from my demons
I can't do this on my own, I don't know what I believe in
Love, don't let me go, save me from my demons
I can't do this on my own, I don't know what I believe in

Anymore, anymore

Pick up the pieces
And let me just take you home, yeah (Oh)
