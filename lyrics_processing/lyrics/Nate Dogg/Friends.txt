Yo yo yo, what's up Nate Dogg?
Niggas just chillin' here with the homie Warren G
(Friends, how many of us have them?)
Reminiscin' on some real friendship man
A lotta kids don't know what that word means
(Friends, how many of us have them?)
Homeboys, ya know what I'm sayin', misusin' their words
Fuck a homie, I'm lookin' for a friend
(Friends, how many of us have them?)
That's what I'm 'bout
(Friends, how many of us have them?)
Uh
How y'all doin'?

Ever since I could remember, I had friends I could depend on
Clothes to lend 'em, money to spend on
But as time went by my life got a little strange
And the rules in this game seem to change
Trust, honesty, and devotion
And money, money, money is the poison potion
There's no way that I can even say
That this game has been good to me, or even bad to me
It had to be 'cause tragically the way this shit
Cracked off for Doggy Dogg was magically
And now I'm gettin' everything I'm supposed to get
But my friendship with niggas always ends up as bullshit
I listen to my momma though (my momma though)
She always tried to prepare me and warn me for the drama, love
But how could she do what I? I mean I'm do or die
But my life on the streets, that shit is suicide
So to cope I got a dogg and a locc
And keep my heat close in case these jokes go for broke
I'm mashin' with the clique 2-1-3 that is (that's right, that's right)
They my homeboys ever since kids, real friends to the end

Hangin' out with my homies
(How many of us have them?)
And I'm feelin' just fine
(How many of us have them?)
I've been ponderin' lately, lately
(How many of us have them?)
A lot of different things on my mind
(How many of us have them?)
It seems lately my friends list
(How many of us have them?)
Done took a slight decline
(How many of us have them?)
And if you wanna know the truth man, man
(How many of us have them?)
Them wasn't no friends of mine
(How many of us have them?)

You ain't no muthafuckin' friend of mine punk
Snitch

You jackin' me up, you takin' my cash
All my life L-B-C, for my city I mash
All those OGs and BGs and wannabies and L-O-Cs
The only friends I got is my 2-1-3s
That's my nigga Snoop D Woop and my nigga N-A-T-E
I can't forget about my nigga H to the Dizzy
Pressure and strikes, don't wanna take no lives
But these jaws, cracks, and hood cracks will make you break some bizzacks
"Wassup homie, can I borrow some cash?"
Last week I gave you $500, so kiss my ass
I got a baby to feed, a family to see through
And shake busta snitches tweekin' like yizzou
Homies and friends, that's what they is fizzor
Stayin' tight and money right and bustin' with a 44
Hangin' out with my homies
(How many of us have them?)
And I'm feelin' just fine
(How many of us have them?)
