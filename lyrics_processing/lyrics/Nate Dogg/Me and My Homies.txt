Me and my homies low
You know we kick it like everyday (everyday, everyday, everyday)
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday (everyday, everyday, everyday)

When I'm alone in my room
And I don't have no one to talk to
I go pick up my phone
And call some folks who know what I go through
After I smoke a joint (come on)
To keep my temper low
I parlay with my friends
There's really no where else to go

Me and my homies low
You know we kick it like everyday (everyday, everyday, everyday)
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday (everyday, everyday, everyday)
Me and my homies low
You know we kick it like everyday (everyday, everyday, everyday)
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday (everyday, everyday, everyday)

I ain't shit without my homeboys
Rather be buried, then see us parted
Keep it close to my heart
'Cause we the ones that got the shit started
You recollect we used to bust on snitches
Nobody come before my niggas, fuck all y'all bitches
All my homeboys are self-sufficient
So we suspicious of your scandalous tricks
Got the police takin' our pictures
Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride
Me and my mothafuckin' homeboys down to die
For each other, 'cause we closer than brothers
It's like we kin we're known for gettin' the party poppin'
When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop actin' phony
Don't forget to bring somethin' for all my homies
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, duckin' bullets
Snatchin' guns when the trick niggas pull it
Handle my business like a professional, the whole world know me
But I ain't shit without my fuckin' homies
Me and my fuckin' homies

Me and my homies, constantly we mash
Me and my homies, gotta make that cash
Me and my homies, there's no need to ask
