From the time that I was only seventeen
I knew I loved to write, I knew I loved to sing, I've seen
I've seen about my friends and all the gangsta things we did (we did)
Back in those days there was some who always said
You'll never make it no, you'll never get ahead (but I)
I kept on goin' for mine, contrary to what they said and I did
This is just to let you know

I'm gonna make
I'm gonna make my (my) money (money)

No matter what they say to me, I'm gonna make my money
And anyone who don't believe, best stay away from me
Been on a mash for currency, since 1993
There ain't no way you stopping me
I'm determined as I can be
And if my funds get low again one thing I guarantee
You catch me by the corner store sellin' badass bags of weed
Not because I think it's cool, or because I think it's neat
It boils down to one simple fact, me and mines have got to eat
