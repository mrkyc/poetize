We keep this poppin', still hit droppin'
Comin' strong just as long as the beat knockin'
Lookin' at the clock won't do no good now
Everybody party 'cause we out of the hood now
Fred Wreck hit, Goldie on the duece-way
Tell him it's crackin' and see what Snoop say
The coupe lay boomin' in the parkin' lot
And I'm pullin' dime pieces off of the top
Eshine, Evine, Candy, Pam
Maisha, Tisha, Sandra, Ann
So last call for alchohol, close the bar
We Dogghouse deep and we rollin' hard

All through the night
Better hit it all day
Every girl in the car

Back off a jack off, we far
From playin' games

No need to explain
Now look at little mama right there
She strain, suck dick and she don't even care
Man, I'm all about breaking these hoes
Shaking these hoes, make a trick
Take off here clothes
Shoot it in her nose
Money fingling, and jingling toes
Me and peep game, "I Got Pros"
Cunt love cock, and cock love cunt
I be feeling like its sex in my blunt
Hey Casey! Where Tracy at?
She said "Daddy, she in the front washin' up the 'lac"
Jumped in my shit, hit the switch, start smashin'
Headed to another spot to fuck some more asses
All my niggas like doin' the damn thing
Happy beat it up like my nigga Pootietang

Because after I'm done I'm like "NEXT!"
With my dick on hard, church to them hoes
