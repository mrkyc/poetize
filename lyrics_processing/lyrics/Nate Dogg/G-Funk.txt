G is for the gang of money I make
F is for the gang of fools I break
U is for the undisputed champ
N is cause you never gonna get the mic back
K is for the niggas that I knock on they back
Damn it feels good to see Long Beach on the map
'Til the day I'm dead I'm gon' keep that shit real
Now you niggas know G-Funk's for real
(ya know)

To those people who don't believe in G-funk
Try to take my style and make a quick buck
Here's a message to one and all
Your pass is revoked
And man I'm havin' a ball
Any questions come and see me
The king of G-Funk the one and only (ya know)
Congratulations you sound like Nate
You took my old hook and got me paid

Some people are nothin' but clones
Some people have styles of their own (ya know)
Some people are copycats
These people can't get the mic back
Can you feel me, one-hitter quitters?
You can't copy me, I'm one in a million
Call any expert and you can ask him
Copy machines can't copy platinum

When you feel like some cavy G-Funk
You need some music to bump in your trunk
I got a baseline, a gangsta tune
Put on the classics and your head will be movin' soon

It's alright
