I pledge allegiance
To all my homies who may never
Love a ho and never will
I give my body
And I give my soul to the funk
May the funk never end

I pledge allegiance to paper chasers
To hustlers who be steady pullin capers
Peace and blessing, may the sun always shine on you
I'm servin' paper, see ya later
I guess that's one mo' thing, I can't be faded
You can test me, get discombobulated
Ain't no question I'm gon' fuck with this
I do it for the funk of it

I pledge allegiance
To all my homies who may never
Love a ho and never will
I give my body
And I give my soul to the funk
May the funk never end
You might also like
I pledge allegiance to my homies who keep it gangsta
Fuck all the haters, they can't stop this groove
I pledge allegiance to the game 'cause it got me balling
Game don't wait so I'm not stalling
I'm still dissing, she's still calling

Uh, what, what, yeah
Uh, check it out now, uh
See this is front line, no turning back now
I'm about to score, this is war on the track now (woo!)
Give me my vest and my ammo and my mac now
I'm 'bout to spit it, and Lord I'ma get it
In the worst WAYYY, slay - competition
Move the opposition, back wake the fuck up! (uh-huh)
Cause when I get beyond enemy lines
I might snipe that ass like John Kennedy's mind
Thou shall not get caught, that's the remedy
Disinfect gun wounds on my last bottle of Hennessy
Bleed to let the seeds remember my memories
It's killed or be killed here son that's the penalty
Red for the funk, cry for the funk
In the heat of the night, I die for the funk
Pharoahe, when I'm six feet deep there's no grieving
Salute the noblest troop and pledge allegiance cause
I pledge allegiance
To all my homies who may never
Love a ho and never will
I give my body (I pledge allegiance to my homies who keep it gangsta, fuck all the haters, they can't stop this groove)
And I give my soul to the funk (I pledge allegiance to the game 'cause it got me balling)
May the funk, never end (Game don't wait so I'm not stalling, I'm still dissing, she's still calling)
I pledge allegiance
To all my homies who may never
Love a ho and never will
I give my body
And I give my soul to the funk
