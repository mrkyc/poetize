These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowin' ain't nobody got my back
These days you gotta be down
Who said it was easy claimin' Dogg Pound?

I believe I got good skills
We been makin' music since we were kids
That's all I wanna do for life
Keepin' it real until the day I die
Obstacles get in my way
Continue to mash and don't forget to pray
I keep my hand on my steel
Because I love my life and I always will
Whatever people say to me
I take it in stride, I'm thinkin' negro, please
If you really don't know me
Then you best back up, I suggest strongly
Yes sir, this is DPG
Until the day I D-I-E
For my L-I-F and E
No matter where I look, that's all I see
And I know

Many women cling to me
Is it 'cause they see me on BET?
Everybody knows my name
All the police think I'm serving 'caine
Jealous niggas call us out
But I don't worry long as I hear their mouths
If ever they decide to kill
You better be prepared because I know I will
One thing I can guarantee
You don't wanna be standin' next to me
Before my final curtain call
I feel safe sayin' it won't be long
So if we bump heads in the street
Or even at some party
You niggas really can't see me
My request is that you stop trying
Before I let go
These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowin' ain't nobody got my back
These days you gotta be down

Everyday, the 4-5 stays on deck for whoever
I'm bustin' takin' down, bowin' down never
Gotta watch my back for these coppers
As well as these niggas that I kick it with
They stick you faster than these bitches will
Since I'm pimpin' everybody wants my riches
And I can't keep a dime from buying weed, yack, and every time
I smoke constantly, it comforts me
From committin' the murders so I chill and puff the herb
Who gots my back? Nobody
Little John Gotti's layin' niggas down at the homie's party
All be goin' crazy I guess we are bein' who we are
Really say the nigga gotta be a star
I gots to get mine and if I blast then it's my destiny
If I die, then it was meant to be intentionally
Warrior stressin', no guessin', no confession
And when the murder take place, it was self protection
These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowin' ain't nobody got my back
These days you gotta be down
