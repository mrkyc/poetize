Oh, what am I to do?
When all the plans I had to spend my life with you
Do not appear on your list of things to do
Love never ceases to amaze me
You should have let me known
Now, what am I to say?
To help you overcome your fears of the unknown
There's just no guarantee in what the future holds
You have to put your faith in loving me
And I'll do the best I can, woman come into man

Oh, I see some things you may never see
You've been some places I may never be
I'll learn from you, while you learn from me
Together we both can grow
Oh, and I'll love you while you're loving me
Mother you, while you father me
We'll be each other's fantasy, la-di-da
Now, after all I had to say
How can you walk away?

Oh... ah, if you leave
Can't build a life
You might also like
Oh, what am I to do?
How can I make things easier for you?
I know what you're thinking, baby
I've been thinking too
This love could end or last forever
Don't let it slip away, what more can I say?
To help you overcome your fears of the unknown
There's just no guarantee in what the future holds
You have to put your faith in loving me
And I'll do the best I can, woman come into man

After all I have to say
How can you walk away?
Oh, what am I to do?
If you leave, can't build my life, can't build my life
(Won't somebody tell me)
If you leave... what more can I say?
If you leave, can't pin a thing around, yeah
(Won't somebody tell me) can't do a damn thing
What more can I do? (what am I to do)
If you leave... yeah, baby (won't somebody tell me)
What more can I do? (what am I to do) Oh yeah, yeah...
(Won't somebody tell me)
What am I to do, what am I to do
