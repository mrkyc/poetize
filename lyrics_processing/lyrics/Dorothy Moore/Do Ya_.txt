So you still get a thrill, when you see me comin' up the hill?
Honey, now do ya? (do ya, do ya?)
Do you whisper my name, just to bring a little comfort?
Do ya? (do ya, do ya?)
So you still like the feel of my body laying next to you?

Well, I guess what I'm asking (guess what I'm asking)
Is do you still love me, do ya?

Or do you lie awake, thinking I'm the biggest mistake
You ever made? (do ya, do ya?)
If you could span your fingers, and make it all go away
Honey, now would you?
Do you miss me when I'm gone, or wish I'd stay gone
A little longer?

Well, I guess what I'm asking (guess what I'm asking)
Is do you still love me, do ya? (do ya, do ya?)

Because I sure do still love you
Oh, these questions I'm asking
You can ask 'em about me too
Love me like you do
You might also like

Honey, now do ya? (do ya, do ya?)
