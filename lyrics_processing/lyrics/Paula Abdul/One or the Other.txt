If you think you're gonna have the time to make up your mind
You shouldn't even try
I'm tired of hearing all of your lines
Just tell me that you're mine

You know I'm better than she'll ever be
It's very clear to me
No more, I'll let you mess with me
But baby, can't you see?

You can only have (One or the other)
Is it gonna be her or is it gonna be me?
You can only have (One or the other)
If it's gonna be her, you got to set me free
You can only have (One or the other)
Is it gonna be her or is it gonna be me?
You can only have (One or the other)
If it's gonna be her, you got to set me free

Let me tell you that it hurts so bad
When you're the last to know
My friends told me so
My heart was always just for you
But now you want her too
