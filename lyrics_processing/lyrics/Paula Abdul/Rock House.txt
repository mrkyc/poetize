Rock you, house you
Turn the fire up, takin' over
Rock you, house you
People, get strong
Rock you, house you
Time to take the weight off our shoulder
Rock you, house you
People, move on

And yes it's time to grow
Spent enough time to know
To believe in you is blind
You only tell us lies
So now that we've agreed
It's time to end your greed
The unanimous decision is to rock you

Rock you, house you
Turn the fire up, takin' over
Rock you, house you
People, get strong
Rock you, house you
Time to take the weight off our shoulder
Rock you, house you
People, move on (You people move on)

You shake a million hands
Make a million plans
And give a promise to the poor
And millions to a war
We tried to beg and plead
Still you ignore our needs
So the only way to teach you is to rock you

Rock you, house you
Turn the fire up, takin' over
Rock you, house you
People, get strong (Come on people, sing!)
Rock you, house you
Time to take the weight off our shoulder
Rock you, house you
People, move on

When I think about the babies eyes
Longing from hunger
I wanna cry, cry cry
Then the situation of our mothers and our brothers
Well, I know (I know)
I know we can make it better
So listen power boys
Your contradictory ploy is the way to peace this war
Kill that noise!
This is our tragedy
To bring you to your knees
And in unity forever, we will rock you

Rock you, house you
Turn the fire up, takin' over
Rock you, house you
People, get strong (Come on people, sing!)
Rock you, house you
Time to take the weight off our shoulder
Rock you, house you
People, move on
Rock you, house you
Turn the fire up, takin' over
Rock you, house you
People, get strong
Rock you, house you
Time to take the weight off our shoulder
Rock you, house you
People, move on
To the nations telling lies
To the brothers down the block
To the power on the streets
To the critics on my jock
Shut up and dance!

Rock you, house you
Turn the fire up, takin' over
Rock you, house you
People, get strong

Set the record straight
Right here and say
Set the record straight (People move on)
Right here and say

Rock you house
You turn the fire, I'm taking over
Rock you house
You people get strong
Rock you house
You time to take the weight off our shoulder
Rock you house
You people move on

Rock you, house you
Turn the fire up, takin' over
Rock you, house you
People, get strong
Rock you, house you
Time to take the weight off our shoulder
Rock you, house you
People, move on
