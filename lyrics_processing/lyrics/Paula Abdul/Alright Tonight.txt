I'm alright tonight
(I'm alright)
You're alright tonight
(You're alright)
We're alright tonight
(It's alright tonight)

You came down a twisted up road
You've been traveling for light years
You got here the same time
Those tears found their way down your face
I fought with the laws tooth and nail and I traveled by night, dear
You're a sight for sore eyes, I've been looking all over the place
Up where the angels sigh
Down there the dreams get smashed on the rocks
You and I wait to begin again
Lifted above by a love that does not end

I'm alright tonight
(I'm alright)
You're alright tonight
(You're alright)
We're alright tonight
(It's alright tonight)
See Paula Abdul LiveGet tickets as low as $51You might also like
You picked up some pieces of light
As you broke through the speed of sound
I was rockin' around in my own two-dimensional way
Now when I hear that jet engine blow
Then I know you are leaving town
Baby, I'd follow you to the edge of it all, anyway
Up where the kingdom comes
Down where the streets take the breath of another young gun
Love is a whispered prayer
Shot like a spark through the heart of dark despair

I'm alright tonight
(I'm alright)
You're alright tonight
(You're alright)
We're alright tonight
(It's alright tonight)

I don't regret any nineteen-year-old indiscretions
I can still fit both my feet In my mouth, anyway
But these days, I'm just not as willing to nurse the obsession
(No, no, no)
If the doc says I've got to come out, then I'm happy to pay
I'm alright tonight
(I'm alright)
You're alright tonight
(You're alright)
We're alright tonight
(It's alright tonight)
I'm alright tonight
(I'm alright)
You're alright tonight
(You're alright)
We're alright tonight
(It's alright tonight)
I'm alright tonight
(I'm alright)
You're alright tonight
(You're alright)
We're alright tonight
(It's alright tonight)
I'm alright tonight
(I'm alright)
You're alright tonight
(You're alright)
We're alright tonight
(It's alright tonight)
I'm alright tonight
(I'm alright)
You're alright tonight
