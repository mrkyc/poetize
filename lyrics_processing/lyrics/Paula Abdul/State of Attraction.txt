(I'm in such a state)

Such a mess, such a funny feeling
I must confess, I never felt like this before
Runnin' hot, runnin' my emotions
Your lovin' shock goes through me like an open door
My heart's in animation
And beating double time

State of attraction
Somehow you make my body come alive
My arms wanna hold ya, my lips wanna kiss
Ya make me want to want you

This is strange, this is all a new thing
What a change, I know that real life ain't like this
Goin' mad, goin' past the love zone
I got it bad, got it so I can't resist
I'm in a deep suspension
A limbo void of time

State of attraction
You're just a magnet to this heart of mine
These eyes wanna know ya, these hands wanna touch
And I'm affected by you

I'm in a state of attraction
Somehow you make my body come alive
My arms wanna hold ya, my lips wanna kiss
Ya make me want to want you
Attraction!

This is love science, a chemical reaction
Ooh baby, to resist ain't worth tryin'
'Cause once ya start the action

State of attraction
I can't resist, a chain reaction
The first time we kiss, mwah!
You got me so excited, what can I do?
You make me want to, want to
State of attraction
State of attraction
I'm in such a state, and I think you know that I can hardly wait
If I'm the magnet, then you're the steel
And I just wanna show you exactly how I feel
State of attraction
I'm in a state, baby
Arms wanna hold ya
Lips wanna kiss ya
I'm in a state of attraction
Runnin' hot, runnin' my emotions, baby, oh
