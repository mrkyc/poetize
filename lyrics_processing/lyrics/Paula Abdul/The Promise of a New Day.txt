Eagle's calling and he's calling your name
Tides are turning, bringing winds of change
Why do I feel this way?
The promise of a new day

The promise, the promise of a new day

As through time, the earth moves under my feet
One step closer to make love complete
What has the final say?
The promise of a new day

The promise, the promise of a new day
The promise, the promise of a new day
The promise, the promise of a new day
The promise

And so time over time, what will change the world?
No one knows (No one knows)
So the only promise is
A day to live, to give and share with one another
