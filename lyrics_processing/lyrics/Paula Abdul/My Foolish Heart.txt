Wishing, dreaming
What a fool, wishing
Come on, come on
Here we go
Love song number nine
With a vengeance, ha!

Maybe tomorrow
Maybe never
One day you might keep a promise
Tell me I see you
But then baby, where are you?
I just don't know how I'm still in love with you
What you do
I haven't got a clue
I wish you could tell me why
My

Foolish heart (Baby)
'S got me into (Oh my)
Foolish heart
'S got me into love again
(Oh my)
Foolish heart (Made me)
It made me love you
(Love you)
My foolish
My foolish heart
