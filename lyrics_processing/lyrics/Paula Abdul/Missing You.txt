Everybody's got to cry sometimes
I never understood the reason why
Suddenly the answer is so clear, I'm missing you
Never thought that we would end this way
And if I only had three words to say
They would simply flow so easily, I'm missing you

Casablanca and white orchids I sent to you
Just a symbol of hope that you still love me too

I'm missing you, baby
I'm missing you, honey
(I'm missing you)
We can't be through
'Cause I'm missing you, darlin'
(I'm missing you)

Everybody's got to hurt sometimes
I always ask myself the question "why?"
Now my pain easily explains, I, I long you
If I had a chance once again
I'd approach us like a love song
So tenderly I'd orchestrate us to be
(A sweet melody)

Sending you romantic cards to remind you of us
Just a token of to entice you to come back to love

I'm missing you, baby
I'm missing you, honey
(I'm missing you)
We can't be through
'Cause I'm missing you, darlin'
(I'm missing you)

Baby, I will take the blame
So let's stop playing silly games
If it will bring you back to me
Baby, I'll say "I'm sorry"
I will gladly sacrifice
To have you back in my life
I'm beggin' you honey please come back to me (Darlin')

Everybody's got to cry sometimes
I never understood the reason why
Now the answer is so clear to me, I'm
I'm missing you, baby
I'm missing you, honey
(I'm missing you)
We can't be through
'Cause I'm missing you, darlin'
(I'm missing you)
I'm missing you, baby
(Everybody's got to cry sometimes)
I'm missing you, honey
(Now the answer is so clear to me, I'm)
