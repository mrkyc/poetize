Don't know which way to go
If you are all that you seem
Then baby I'm movin' way too slow
Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever oh oh oh
Or am I caught in a hit and run
Straight up now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together oh oh oh
Are you just having fun
Do do you love me ?
I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught
In the slammin' door
Are you more than hot for me
Or am I a page in your history-book
I don't mean to make demands
But the word and the deed go hand in hand
How about some information--please
I was in love the moment that I saw you
I followed you thru the crowd and I almost lost you

It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out
Baby there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet
It ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together
Baby seems we never ever agree
You like the movies
And I like T.V
I take things serious
And you take 'em light
But when we get together
It just all works out
I take--2 steps forward
I take--2 steps back
We come together
'cause opposites attract
And you know--it ain't fiction
Just a natural fact
We come together
'cause opposites attract
2 steps forward
2 steps back
We come together
'cause opposites attract
And you know--it ain't fiction
Just a natural fact
We come together
'cause opposites attract
Baby pick your head up
Come on and look me in the face
Baby just remember I gave you my heart
Ain't no one gonna tear us apart
He could promise the moon
And the stars above
Even if he promised me the world
Just remember I'm forever your girl
Just remember I'm forever your girl
Such a mess, such a funny feeling
I must confess, I never felt like this before
Runnin' hot, runnin' my emotions
Your lovin' shock, goes through me like an open door
Ooh my heart's in animation
You got me beating in double time
State of attraction
Somehow you make my body come alive
My arms wanna hold ya
My lips wanna kiss
Ya make me want to want you
(It's the way that you love me)
(It's just the way that you love me)
(It's the way that you love me)
(It's just the way that you love me)
It ain't the clothes that you wear
It ain't the things that you buy
It ain't your house on the hill
It ain't the plane that you fly
It ain't the money or the diamond rings
Honey I ain't impressed with your material things
It's the way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me
It's the way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me
He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh oh oh
Girl don't play the fool--no
How come how come he can he can tell-a tell-a you're-a you're-a
Always always number number one without a doubt
When-a when-a he is he is always always squirmin' squirmin'
Like a little snake under-a e-ver-y-a rock
You've been you've been workin' workin' on the on the love
And he's been only only playing undercover all the while
Take a take another 'nother look into his eyes
And you will on-ly see a rep-tile
All the world's a candy store
He's been trick or treatin'
When it comes to true love girl with him
There's no one home
He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh oh oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Oh oh oh
