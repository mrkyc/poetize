Why does it hurt so?
I'm wrapped in our love
And I don't wanna be undone

Why does love hurt so?
How do you just know
How to get to me, baby?
Words aren't only words
When from you they hurt
When you say you really love me

Maybe it's a trick
Something doesn't click
Maybe it's a spell
That you've got me under
Something's going down
Turn my world around
I woke up and I found
I was spellbound

(Spellbound) So
(Spellbound) So wicked
(Spellbound)
And your prison feels good, so
(Spellbound) Your kisses
(Spellbound) Against my wishes
(Spellbound)
I wouldn't help it if I could

Metaphysical more than visual
You touch the heart of me
Night turns into day
Shadows fade away
When you say you really love me

Maybe it's a trick
Something doesn't click
Maybe it's a spell
That you've got me under
Something's going down
Turn my world around
I woke up and I found
I was spellbound

I wouldn't help it if I could
I hope
I hope it's not a scheme
Who are you?
How do I know it's not just a game?
You're such a player
But you know how to get right to my core
You are like a dream

Maybe it's a trick (No!)
Something doesn't click (So!)
Maybe it's a spell that you've got me under
Something's going down (Right here!)
Turn my world around (And around!)
I woke up and I found
I was spellbound (So!)

So, so, so, so wicked
So, so, so, so wicked
So, so, so, so wicked
