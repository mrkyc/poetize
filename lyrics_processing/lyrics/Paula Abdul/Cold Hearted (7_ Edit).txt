He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by the rules
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Girl, don't play the fool now

You're the one givin' up the love
Anytime he needs it
But you turn your back and then he's off
And runnin' with the crowd
You're the one to sacrifice
Anything to please him
Do you really think he thinks about you when he's out?

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by the rules
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Girl, don't play the fool now

It was only late last night
He was out there sneakin'
Then he called you up to check that you
Were waiting by the phone
All the world's a candy store
He's been trick-or-treating
When it comes to true love, girl
With him, there's no one home

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by the rules
Uh-oh, uh-oh

How come how come he can he can tell-a tell-a you're-a you're-a
Always always number number one without a doubt
(He's he's one one cold cold snake snake)
When-a when-a he is he is always always squirmin' squirmin'
Like a little snake under-a e-ver-y-a rock?
(No no give give, all all take take)
You've been you've been workin' workin' on the on the love
And he's been only only playing undercover all the while
(One one smooth smooth sharp sharp tongue tongue)
Take a take another 'nother look into his eyes
(He he just just talks)
And you will on-ly see a rep-tile
You could find somebody better, girl
He could only make you cry
You deserve somebody better, girl
(Let me tell ya) He's c-cold as ice
(He's cold as ice, he's cold as ice)
Stay away from him, girl!
