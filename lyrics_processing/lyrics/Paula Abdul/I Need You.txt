All alone; it's you and me
Time to tell you now just how I feel
Babe, to you, I bare my heart
A light of love here in the dark

Don't you know I might be strong
But deep down there's a sweetness
Only you can touch and make me feel
Oh, what a joy
You're such a perfect lover
Yes, you always know just what to do

Oh, I-I-I need you
Oh baby, you know
You know I do
Oh, I-I-I need you
When the going gets rough
You know I do

At the start, I couldn't say
All my feelings I could not portray
But I got to tell you now
That I really need your love, babe
Oh, it's coming on strong
