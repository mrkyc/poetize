Just girl to boy
I'd like to share this thought with you
Our love's a joy
Two ones have made inseparable two
Last night my heart spoke to me
And it said You've found that lover friend
So now I've finally got the courage just to ask you, baby
Ooh

(Will you, will you?) Will you marry me, boy?
(Will you, will you?) Will you marry me?
(Will you, will you?) Will you marry me, boy?
(Will you, will you?) Will you, will you?
Come on, baby, now

I lay awake (Oh)
So full with hope Of things to come
For heavens sake
I pray I'm not the only one
I never dreamed I'd be so bold
I'm standing here, My heart's been sold
So now I've finally got the courage just to ask you, baby
Ooh

Get an old house, find a backyard
Buy some flowers down the street
Tell your mother, tell your father
Don't tell anyone at all
All we need is
Just the two of us
