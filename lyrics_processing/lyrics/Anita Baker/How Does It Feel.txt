Changed all my plans, look what you've done
My house is small, and there's only room for one
I know this game, darling, I don't want to play
Why can't I just walk away?
Who's got the time? I need my space
Maybe someday in another time and place
Just turn around, I don't need this, not right now
But I'm falling anyhow

(How does it feel?) And it feels so fine
(How do you know?) 'cause I feel something deep down inside
(What do you see?) I see the light in his eyes
And I know what I know (I know it's clear)
Nobody's got to tell me so
(How does it feel?) Said that it feels so fine, yessir
(How do you know?) Feel something deep down inside
(What do you see?) I see the light in his eyes
And I know what I know (I know it's clear)
Nobody gotta tell me so

See, hearts never lie, the truth is in a sigh
I look in his eyes and I'm on fire
Logic prevail
I don't believe in fairytales
But now, lately I find, I'm waiting by the phone
And I don't want to be alone
Feelings won't fade
But I'm falling deeper every day

(What do you see?) I see the light in his eyes
And I know what I know (I know it's clear)
Nobody gotta tell me so
(How does it feel?) I said that it feels so fine, yessir
(How do you know?) Feel something deep down inside
(What do you see?) I see this light in his eyes
And I know what I know (I know it's clear)
Nobody got to tell me

(Ain't nobody got to tell me so)
I know what I know
(Ain't nobody got to let me so)
I give up, I give in
Touch your body, taste your skin
The answer is the same again and again

(How does it feel?)
(How do you know?)
(What do you see?) I see the light in his eyes
And I know what I know (I know it's clear)
(How does it feel?) I said that it feels so fine, yessir

And I know what I know (I know it's clear)
(How does it feel?)
(How do you know?) Feel what I feel, baby
(What do you see?) See...
