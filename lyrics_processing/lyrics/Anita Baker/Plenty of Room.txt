I thought I told you everything you needed
You needed to know
I thought I gave you everything
And then you, you decided to go

Ooh, you know I understand
Child, I love you with an open hand
If you should ever need me
You know where I am

And I got room
Plenty of room
Never lonely again
Just open my door, come on in
'Cause I got room
Plenty of room
You'll never be lonely again
Open my door, come on in
'Cause I got room

Don't you know I love you, child
Wherever, wherever you roam on your own?
Lord knows it gets cold outside
And if you
You should want to come home
Come on home
You might also like
You know I don't lie
Should the world outside
Make you want to cry
Don't you be shy, darling
Why don't you come on by?

'Cause I've got room
Plenty of room
Never lonely again
Just open my door, come on in
'Cause I got room
Plenty of room
You'll never be lonely again
Just open my door, come on in
'Cause I got room

Oh, right now would be a good time to find
That you have walked into my room
Any time is a good time, baby
It ain't never too late, baby
Never too soon
Love is all I wanna give
I wish I knew what you were gonna do
Ain't no one in the world, boy
But me and you
You know it's true
Sit down at my table 'til your spirit is fed
Lay your burdens by the fire
Rest your worries in my bed
I'll never leave you lonely, oh boy
Now don't you hear what I said?
I got room
Oh yes, some room
Never lonely again, child
Just open my door, come on, come on
I got room
