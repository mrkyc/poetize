When I think about how much I'm loving you
No limitations, no set of regimented rules
I'm amazed how much this love has touched my life
And the commitment that we share is a welcome sacrifice

This must be sweet fatal attraction
My life-long date with destiny
Love this strong, it just brings out the passion
I never knew was here in me

And I love you just because, (I love you) just because
Just because I do - my darlin', you
Emotions more than words can help me say
I love you, (and I love you, and I love you) baby
Just because you're you
(Just because you're you)
Just because you're you

You're a diamond in my mind, a treasure found
A precious gem to me, you're so nice to have around
I'm so glad I took the path that led to this
And it's amazin' loving you
I'm doin' things I never thought I'd do
You might also like
I don't know, there ain't no explanation
Of why I'm sharin' love at last this way
I won't try to work out all my reasons
I'II use these words to simply say

I love you just because, (I love you) just because
Just because I do - my darlin', you
Emotions more than words can help me say
I love you, (and I love you, and I love you), my baby
I love you just because, (I love you) just because
Just because I do - darlin', you
Emotions more than words can help me say
I love you (And I love you, and I love you)
You know I do, baby

Could it be that there's more to this that meets the eye?
Maybe that's the reason why
All I know is when I'm in your arms, it feels all right
I hold on tight, and I come alive

(I love you) just because, (I love you)
Surely do - my darlin'
Emotions more than words can help me say
I love you (And I love you, and I love you)
Hey, a-hey-hey, a-hey, hey...
(I love you) Just because, (I love you)
Just because I do - oh, yeah (Darlin'...)
I, I couldn't take it back if I wanted to
I just love you... (And I love you, and I love you)
Hey, hey, I just love you, baby
(I love you) just because, (I love you)
Ain't nothin' I can do... (Darlin')
Nothin' I can do about it, nothin' I can do about it
I just love you... (And I love you, and I love you)
I just love you, I just love you
(I love you) just because, (I love you)
Couldn't take it back if I wanted to (Darlin'...)
That's just the way it is, baby
That's just the way it is, baby
(And I love you, and I love you)
Oh, hey, don't I love you
