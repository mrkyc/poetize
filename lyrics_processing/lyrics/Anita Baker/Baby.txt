This heart of mine seldom lies you see
It's often said you don't care for me no more
You took so long, how could you lead me on?
Left me wondering where and how we went wrong

Come on, baby (make it alright)
My baby (say it's alright)
Would you, baby?
And I'll be alright if I could only see you
Baby (make it alright)
Please baby (say it's alright)
Would you, baby?
And I'll be alright if I could only see you
Won't you please do this for me?

Heart of mine, please, just let him go
Always knew you'd leave
Honey, many times I told you so
Yesterday it was when you walked out my door
Hopes and dreams of mine lay scattered on my floor

Come on, baby (make it alright)
Oh baby (say it's alright)
Would you, baby?
And I'll be alright if I could only see you
Baby (make it alright)
Oh, baby (say it's alright)
Would you, baby?
And I'll be alright if I could only see you
Won't you please do this for me?

Holding on to your memory is what I've done
(Baby, see what I've done, baby, see what I've done)
Oh yeah, holding on to my pillow, it's all I've got, yes

And the power of your thunder
Belongs to someone new
Ain't it any wonder I cry the whole night through
How we ever made it's a mystery to me
Fire and water were never meant to be

Baby (make it alright)
Oh baby (say it's alright)
Would you, baby?
And I'll be alright if I could only see you
Baby (make it alright)
Oh, baby (say it's alright)
Would you, baby?
And I'll be alright if I could only see you

Make it alright
Oh, would you, baby?
Oh, let me see you, darling, now
See you, baby
Love you, darling
Awww, I wanna, I wanna love you, baby
Oh baby, oh, would you, baby?
And I'll be alright
All I wanna do is love you, baby
