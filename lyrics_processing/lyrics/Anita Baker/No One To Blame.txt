Yes, I've been around and I watch you, baby
I know you're the one
And I see you and I cry inside, baby
The moment has come-but I
I try to hide what I feel like, baby
Don't want you to know
It's a feeling so deep in my heart, baby
I can't let it go

No one to blame
If I miss this, sho' would be shame
No one to blame, baby
Sho' is a shame

There ain't no reason to doubt me, baby
You know I don't lie
And I tell you from deep in my heart, baby
I'm willing to try, yes I am
'Cause this ain't no game that I'm playing, baby
Our love is for real
And I tell you I know that it's strong
I know what I feel, yes
You might also like
No one to blame, baby
If I miss this, sho' would be shame
No one to blame, darlin' if
I miss this, sho' would be a shame
No one to blame, baby
Sho' is a shame

My baby, life offers no prize
No guarantees, baby, for missed opportunitites
And I won't let you walk by
I've got to try, telling you I know it's right
It's the truth, don't you lie, baby, yes

You know that I tried to resist you, baby
But I'm losin' my fight
I mean this, I really do mean this, baby
You know that I'm tell you no lies
This ain't no game that I'm playing, baby
This thing is for real
And I want you to know that it's strong
I know what I feel

No one to blame, baby
I don't wanna miss this, you know I don't, baby
No one to blame
Sho' is a shame
No one to blame
If I miss this, sho' would be a shame
No one to blame
Sho' is a shame
No one to blame
If I miss this, sho' would be a shame
No one to blame
Sho' is a shame
No one to blame
