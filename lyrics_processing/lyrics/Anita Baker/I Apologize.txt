Operator, get my baby on the line
'Cause just the other night
We had a horrible fight
I admit that I, I was out of control
But I still love my man
With my body and soul

When the road gets rough
You say thangs you should not say
I never meant to treat my baby that way

I apologize
Oh, believe me I do
I apologize
Oh honest and true
Because I know I was wrong
And so I'll sing you this song
And I'm tryna get through
And make it up to you, yes

Operator, it was like a bad dream
And Lord you should have heard
The way he shouted and the way that I screamed
I regret it 'cause I was unfair
I took it all out on him
Just because he was there
You might also like
When the road gets rough
You say thangs you should not say
I never meant to treat my daddy that way

I apologize
Oh, believe me I do
I apologize
Oh honest and true
Because I knew I was wrong
So I'll sing you this song
And I'm gonna get through, yeah
And make it up to you

I apologize for I was unkind
And I wish that I could go back in time
Erase the goodbyes
And rewrite my life
But come rain or come shine
I'm wanna do it right this time
I apologize
(Believe me I do...honest and true)

Oh baby, I do
Because I knew I was wrong
That's why I'm singing my my my song
Yeah yeah yes
I apologize, oh yes
I apologize, oh yes, oh yes
Because I know I was wrong
And so I sing you this song
And I wanna get, I gotta get, I need to get through to you, yeah yeah
(Believe me I do) Oh listen, oh baby
(Honest and true) I'm talking to you right now, oh, I'm talking to you
(I was wrong, I sing you this song)
I was wrong, baby, listen to me right now
Singing it to you right now, I was wrong
(Believe me I do...honest and true)
(I was wrong, I sing you this song)
(Believe me I do...honest and true)
