Oh, the last time I saw you
You looked so good, baby
There was moonlight everywhere
Oh and God only knows How I hated to leave you standing there
You know I told you that I wanted to hold you
But the moment was not right
So I took off down the road for another lonely night

Oh, I wanna spend my life with you
Baby, tell me is that so wrong
I don't ever want to say good night to you
I wanna hold you all night long

Baby, this is serious
Baby, baby, this is serious
Oh baby, this is serious for the two of us
Oh yes, serious
Serious, baby
Serious

Oh, all day long I keep thinkin' about you
And I'm ready to give in
'Cause I may never find anybody like you again
You see nobody's ever made me want to
Do what I'm 'bout to do
Because I found everything
And it's all wrapped up in you
You might also like
Oh, I wanna spend my life with you
Baby, tell me is that so wrong
I don't ever want to say goodbye to you
I wanna hold you all night long

Baby, this is serious
Ooh, serious, I'm so serious
Baby baby, this is serious for the two of us

I can hardly believe what I'm sayin'
All my lifetime I've been prayin'
To find somebody who's heart's not taken
And I believe you're the one
Oh no, I don't mean at all to upset you
Honey, I knew from the moment I met you
If I could find a way to get you
I'd have to fall in love

Serious
Serious, wanna be serious, baby let me get
Serious about the two of us
Serious, oh, serious
Serious, serious, baby
Serious, I'm so serious
Ooh wee, baby; ooh wee, baby
Oh baby
Every night I want you by my side
So I can love you, yes
Every night I want you by my side
So I can love you
'Cause forever's what it's gonna take to love you
Every night I want you by my side
