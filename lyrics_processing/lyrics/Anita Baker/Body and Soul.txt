What have you done to me?
I can't eat, I cannot sleep
And I'm not the same anymore, no, no
I don't know what to do
'Cause all of me wants all of you
Do I stand alone at the shore?

Now once I could turn away
From everything I feel today
But now I wanna walk through your door

But I've got to know, oh, body and soul
That you've got no doubt, inside and out
We are whole, oh, body and soul
Don't leave me out in the cold (out in the cold)
Just love me body and soul
(Body and soul)
Do you hear me, baby?

I've wasted too much time
Living for what wasn't mine
And then came the day I found you
And now I want nothing less
I've found a love that is truly blessed
And I wanna make dreams come true
You might also like
But I've got to know, oh, body and soul
That you've got no doubt, inside and out
We are whole, oh, body and soul
Don't leave me out in the cold (out in the cold)
Just love me body and soul

Every day is getting better (keeps getting better)
The more I trust I feel stronger, stronger (getting stronger)
Every kiss brings me closer (closer)
It feels good to let you inside

I've got to know, oh
Is there any doubt in your mind, oh yeah
Oh, baby, ho, ho, body and soul
Don't leave me out in this cold
Just love me body, hey, love me
I've got to know, oh
Bet your dollar, baby, yeah...oh oh oh...
Is there any doubts in your mind?
Tell me baby, tell me darlin', body and soul
Just love me
Just  love me body and, and soul
Oh, oh, oh, oh yes
Body and soul, soul
Body and soul, soul
Body and soul, soul
Body and soul, soul
