We used to laugh
Now all I do is cry
You used to make me happy
Now you don't even try
You're hurting me, yeah
You're doing me wrong
I can see it in your eyes
Soon you're gonna be gone

And I know I'm gonna miss you
My love I will send with you
'Cause I've been down too long
And you keep doin' me wrong

And there will be no more tears for you
Gonna be no more crying now
Gonna be no more tears for you
See, my eyes have run dry
And there's no more tears

And no more sadden eyes
From crying through the night
Gonna gather up, gather up my feelings
And lock them all inside
So when you say you're leaving
And you walk out my door
I can truly say to myself
He cannot hurt me anymore
You might also like
And I know I should be crying
But instead I'm slowly dying
'Cause all my love has gone
From two hearts so badly torn

And there'll be no more tears for you
Gonna be no more crying now
Gonna be no more tears for you
See, my eyes have run dry
And there's no more tears

And I know I'm gonna miss you
But for love I got me someone else
'Cause I, I been down, been down too long
And you, you keep doing me wrong

And there'll be no more tears for you
And gonna be no more crying now
And gonna be no more tears for you
'Cause you see, my eyes have run dry
And there's no more tears
No more tears for you
(Ain't no more to cry)
No more crying now
No more tears for you
My eyes have run dry
No more tears for you
(I'm gonna be alright after a while)
No more crying now
(I'm gonna be alright if you would leave)
No more tears for you
(Surely won't you try, surely won't you, surely won't you try, baby tonight)
No more tears for you
(I'm gonna be all right)
No more crying now
(Lord knows I don't need you no more, baby)
No more tears for you
(I'll make it on my own, on my own)
