I had a dream
A love dream so tender
You were with me, old friend
We gave in to sweet surrender
Now I've held it in through October, November
No wonder, I've never been the same since then
I picked up my phone
A million times to call you
But I lost my nerve
'Cause every time I saw you
Like a lovesick kid
Child, it was my paranoia
You would laugh
But instead
You read these thoughts inside of my head
And it's you

It's been you all the time
You're changing my whole state of mind
It took just a minute
But now that I'm in it
It's you, darling
It's been you all the time
Like somebody turned on a light (shine)
Come on and watch me shine, boy
It's been you all the time
You might also like
Now when you smile
The world opens up for me
You're just my style
And this time I do believe
We're two of a kind
How could I be so blind?
My heart, it's sincere
I believe I've wanted you for years and years
And it's you, baby

It's been you all the time
Oh, you're changing my whole state of mind
It took just a minute
Oh, but now that I'm in it
It's you, darling
It's been you all the time
Like somebody turned on a light (shine)
You're gonna watch me shine, yes
It's been you all the time

Oh, now to think you've always been right here, yes
When loneliness has been my greatest fear
Until I saw the answers in your eyes
Yes, I did
And at last it's clear
Now I see that
You're the only one for me
It's been you all the time
Oh no, baby
It took just a minute
Oh, but now that I'm in it
It's you, darling
It's been you all the time
Like somebody turned on a light (shine)
You're gonna watch me shine, boy
It's been you all the time
It's been you all the time
Baby, you turned on a light, I said
It took just a minute
But now that you got me in it
It's been you all the time
I'm loving you, yes
Come on and watch me shine
It's been you all the time
It's been you all the time
Ooh wee, baby
It took just a minute
But now that I'm in it, it's you, baby
It's been you all the time
Oh Lordy, somebody turn those lights out
You got to watch me shine, yeah
