I can smell the scent of fresh cut grass
You know it kind of took me back
To yesterday when we was young, oh so young
I remember we were so scared
To even hold each other's hands
But still we fell so deep in love

When did it start to rain?
How did things get so strange
When did it go astray, baby?

'Cause you don't love me (I love you) or want me (I want you)
Sometimes I think that you don't know me
I just need for you to show me
Oh, like you used to do
Like you used to do, baby

You were my Weezy, you were my Boo
You was my Thelma, damn, I was into you
Why can't it be that way again, baby, baby
You were my Marvin, my Billy Dee
Ooh baby, my, my, my sweet melody
Why can't you play that music today?
I wanna play, baby

When did it start to rain?
How did things get so strange?
When did it go astray?

Girl, you don't want me (yes I do), need me (I need you too)
Girl, you don't even try to please me
I could if you would squeeze me
Like you used to do
Like you used to do, ooh yeah
You don't hear me (I hear you), you don't feel me (I feel you, baby)
Sometimes I think you don't even see me
Well, girl, I would if you believed in me, yeah
Like you used to do, baby baby, baby baby
Like you used to do
When we gonna do it like we used to?
When we gonna do it?
Like you used to do
When we gonna do it like we used to do?
When we gonna do it?

Tell me when did it start to rain?
How did things get so strange, baby?
When did it go astray?
I wanna know when, when did it start to rain?
How did things get so strange, I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know, baby
Well, you don't hear me (I hear you, baby), you don't feel me (I feel you, darlin')
Sometimes I think that you don't see me
Well girl I would if you believed in me, yeah
Oh baby baby
Like you used to do

Like you used to do
Like you used to do
Like you used to do
