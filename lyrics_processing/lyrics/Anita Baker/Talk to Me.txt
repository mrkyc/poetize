Baby, baby, baby
You stand all alone on your own
Please come inside from that storm
Stand where it's warm
I can see you're in need
Baby, please talk to me now
Swear nothing is wrong
You're so strong
Baby, don't hold this inside
Relax your pride
Let it go
Set it free
My baby, talk to me now
What's wrong, wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me what you're going through, darling?
