I feel you moving, slipping away
I try to call but I can't find the words to say
My lips move, ah, but they don't make a sound
I hear your voice but you're nowhere around
I close my eyes, I can't find my sleep
My wounds will not heal, you've cut me too deep
My mind is strong but my spirit is weak
I, I guess got to get back on my feet

Well, you can be so cruel
That I just don't understand
Do the tears I cry, baby
Hey, does it make you feel like a man?
And I told you once, boy
Oh baby, let me tell you again
You can't do right 'cause you're the wrong man
You're the wrong man
You're the wrong man
You're the wrong man

I hear you calling but I ain't no fool
I've got to be stronger, I've got to get over you
Each time I cry, it's the sign of my pain
Every tear that falls carries your name
All I know is I cannot go on
Everything I do for you is wrong
Ain't nothing I can say or can do
I just got to, I gotta get up, child
I gotta move
You might also like
Hear me, baby
Tell me what you want me to do
Ain't my my my, ain't my lovin' good enough for you?
I told you once boy, baby let me tell you again
You can't do right 'cause you're the wrong man
You're the wrong man, baby
You're the wrong man
I said that you're the wrong man

You know I love you
Sometimes it just ain't enough
And I don't wanna leave you
Baby, but I'm giving you up
And I told you once, boy
I don't wanna tell you again
You can't do right 'cause
You're the wrong man
You can't do right, baby
You can't do right, baby
You're the wrong man
You can't do right, baby
Don't you do right

I'd rather lose you, child, than to lose my mind, yes
Say it again
