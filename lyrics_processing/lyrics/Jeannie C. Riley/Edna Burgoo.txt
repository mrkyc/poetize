When the roll was called that fall
And class was ready to begin
She was five feet nine
And showin' signs of growing still some more
Every time she'd sit down
She bump her knees and knock her pencils on the floor
There was one old gripy teacher in the bunch
Picked on Edna for everything
From books to the baloney in her lunch
And Edna's temper every day was growing mighty thin
So to avoid the clash
She changed her class
Took up gym when basketball begin
Now the forward on our team was Mabel Earl
She refused to let her coach replace her with this big new girl
So Edna won the bench
While we moaned and groaned as Mabel failed to score
Now I can't say who done it
But at the half
Someone helped Mabel break her toe
Now the action sure got fast that second half
With Mabel out
Edna came on strong to bring the home team back
There was no way that ball could miss
When Edna raised her feet

The crowd came screaming off their seats
Our strappy little guard was Emma Jean
No sooner the ball would miss the hook
Then she'd steal it for our team
Edna threw the goal so fast
The lights couldn't keep up with the score
And a halftime 80:17 climbed all the way to read 90:84
Two minutes left showed on the scoreboard clock
Edna and Emma Jean were sweating
Like cotton hands on the dock
With seconds left
A faster playing just about splattered our minds
For Edna had two free shots coming
And the score was 90:89
When Edna Burgoo put her tootsies on the mark
Everybody in that place got so quiet
It hurt my heart
She bounced the ball on her fingertips
And then she hit the spot
It was 90:90
But nobody moved
And she steadied her knees for that second shot
Made no difference if her shoe was No. 10
We were pulling for her to make the mark
And let our home team win
Then the hats flew high
And the crowd went wild when Edna's shot was done
For she made champions of us all
