It was windy and raining outside
So I decided to stay in clean my room
And give a lift to my pride
I was cleaning out the corner of my closet
And overturned a boxlid
And there were my yearbooks and pictures
And my yesterday friends
On the very first page
Jeannie Adams set smiling at me
She was the queen of the senior class
But she failed in history
Hi, Jeannie
'Member when we played hockey
With those out of town boys
And how scared we got
They didn't wanna bring us back and called us killjoys
On the next page
There was Johnny Roosevelt
Most handsome boy at school
Hi, Johnny
Guess you never knew what a crush I had on you
You might also likeBut it only lasted until Michael Grady moved to Central High
He was a big bashful football bawl
And I loved him at first sight
Well there you are, Mike
I was wondering when you'd be showing up
Gosh, you've got a bruise on your eye
Oh I remember those Pacus boys were mighty rough
And remember how us girls all cried
When we lost the game that night
It was so cold
Why you couldn't even squeeze me
You were bandaged up so tight
Hello, Paddy June and Billy Roy
Heard you've married and settled down
Betty Rogers still writes now and then
Since I moved out of town
You remember my daddy got a transfer
When school came to an end
And for awhile
I lost tracks of my yearbooks and yesterdays friends
But today as I visit back with you
Hi, Joni and Clyde
I know I never really could forget you even if I tried
For in my heart
All our years together
Never came to an end
And you know
There's really no such thing as a yesterday friend
