We saw a sign, "Welcome - Satan Place"
When we moved to town that day
And rows of little white homes
That looked like castles all along the way
But after living there a while
We found it wasn't what we thought at all
They had a private little scandal going on
Behind each castle wall

There was a Town Council meeting
On the day the story come to pass
Someone said, "Mrs. Brown
We think your little girl is living way too fast
She's been dating older boys
And staying out much later than she should
And there's been quite a lotta talk about it
Going round the neighborhood"

Well, Mrs. Brown said, "Since you brought it up
I think I'll tell you what I saw
The day your daughter Ellie
And the judge's son went swimming in the raw
Is that supposed to be a part
Of what you call learning social grace?
'Cause if it is, I think you people
Are in trouble here in Satan Place"

"I heard your neighbor's daughter Betty
Spent the summer in another town
They say she gained a little weight before she left
But now she's trimmed back down
And now I wonder why the banker's son
Won't even look her in the face
We used to see 'em both together
Everywhere they went in Satan Place"

"They say the Mayor's daughter
Got another speeding ticket just last week
They didn't charge for drunken driving
Even though she couldn't hardly speak
I heard she brags about the way
Her daddy gets free liquor by the case
From all those bootlegging friends
Who make a killing here in Satan Place"

When Mrs. Brown had finished talking
No one dared to make a single sound
Until the chairman of the meeting rapped his gavel
And looked around
And as his eyes swept across the room
At guilty looks on every face
He said, "That wraps up this meeting
Of the Council of Satan Place"
He said, "That wraps up this meeting
