And the Harper Valley PTA
Well, have you ever wondered where they are
And what those folks are doing today?
Now, things have changed a lot
But we all seem to understand things better by and by
Now, my daughter is the mother of two children
At the Harper Valley High
Well, my daughter came to see me
She was selling tickets for the high school dance
I could win a brand new album by some Stray Cats
If I'd only buy a chance
Well, I bought the tickets and the chance
To win a brand new rock 'n' roll LP
And when Friday came
I walked into the place
My dress was well below my knees
Now, Mr. Harper took my ticket
And he smiled at me as sober as a judge
Shirley Thompson
She was there with him
She shook my hand and then gave me a hug
You know, they're married now
And my, they look so happy and contented side by side
And to my surprise
Bobby Taylor never took his eyes off of his wife
Mr. Baker stirred the punch
It was lemonade with nothing on the side
His secretary smiled at me
And said she was so happy as his bride
Widow Jones is dead
She and a young kid missed a curve on Lover's Lane
Mr. Kelley's gone
He drank until they said it took his liver and his brain
Now, the music started up
And it was louder than a thunder storm in May
Well, I stood there and I laughed
To see the way the kids all get their kicks today
Then I saw a man who gave a cigarette
To some small kid too young to smoke
He was a full-grown man and he was set up
In the parkin' lot sellin' dope
Well, I walked around the place
And saw the drummer sniffing powder up his nose
Then I walked out through the parking lot
And saw these kids were takin' off their clothes
You might also likeThey were drinking beer and popping pills
And acting like they were all having fun
I got so mad
I thought at first I'd go back to the house and get a gun
Then I went back to my home
And took my Bible out
And said a little prayer
Now, tomorrow, I can tell 'em that
God loves 'em and I tell 'em that I care
I think back fifteen years ago when
I was wild and wore a mini skirt
Ain't no way I can explain the things I did
And all the people that I hurt
Well, the music keeps on ringing in my ears
And I can hear the drummer's beat
I can see the way things are and I can see
The things the kids are thinking neat
Well, tomorrow afternoon
The PTA'll meet
And I got things to say
To a brand new generation of the Harper Valley PTA
