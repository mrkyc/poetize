I'm D'Banj
Oshe, oshe, hmm
Hahahaha
And you know now
Don, Don, Don Jazzy again
Now this goes out, to my one and only sweet potato in the world
My vow to you

Take my heart, take my love
Take my body, come build my home
Stay with me, di iyawo mi
'Cause you love me
I will be your scapegoat, honey
'Cause you came through for me
You gave me breakthrough baby (oh ahh)
I will be your scapegoat, honey
'Cause you came through for me
You gave me breakthrough baby (oh ahh)

Baby boo, I can see your eyes
Say you don jam many fools for your life
Dem go come as lovers as dem disguise
But as time goes by na your body be the prize
The back side sef wey you carry na die
That's why sometimes I no dey surprise
Them go say dem love you but that na lie
Chop and clean mouth, tell you, "Bye-bye"
Me sef I no tell you say na me holy pass
Some people dey talk say I dey use jazz
Dem say I bush, some say I razz
Dem say I be nobody, I no get class

Well, I've been bad and I know it
And I'm sorry, wanna show it
But no one, will give me a chance to prove myself
Despite what you've heard of me
You still went ahead to be with me
You have chosen to be there for me
To you, I make this vow, I say

Take my heart, take my love
Take my body, come build my home
Stay with me, di iyawo mi
'Cause you love me
I will be your scapegoat, honey
'Cause you came through for me
You gave me breakthrough baby (oh ahh)

For all those guys that caused you pain
That broke your heart and brought you shame
If you need someone to blame
You can put the blame on me
For all those guys wey spoil your name
Those guys that drove you insane
Let me be the one to pay
At your beck and call with no delay
I'll stay committed to you girl
I'll never fall your hand
Let, let them call me a fool girl
Omo na dem get their mouth, oh-oh-oh

I've been bad and I know it
And I'm sorry, wanna show it
But no one, will give me a chance to prove myself
Despite what you've heard of me
You still went ahead to be with me
You have chosen to be there for me
To you, I make this vow, eh

Take my heart, take my love
Take my body, come build my home
Stay with me, di iyawo mi
