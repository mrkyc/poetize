Mo hits records

Am D'banj or ski'banj as my Jamaican friends call me
Why me o kokolets 1 2
Why me o kokolets 1 2
You dey try me kokolets 1 2
You dey try me kokolets 1 2
She said she wanted to be mine
That my koko just dey wild
So tell me why me o
But it was a one night stand
Baby don't u understand
So tell me why me o why me o
Why me o you dey try me o
You dey try me o you dey try me o
You dey try me tell me why me
I don't know how to say this
But this girl drives me crazy
Cause I cruise in town with a Mercedes
So she said she wanna have my baby
First when I met her she said koko master come test her
We could do it ones twice maybe better
Wanna test my skills so I let her yes so I let her
So sexy so tempting
So pretty contemplating
How to get all up in her huh
Make she get a taste of my huh
Took her to my crib now
Ln my drop top took her top off body was a jump off
Started on the floor now to the bed now hands on the wall
Devil was the bomb now
She wouldn't leave me alone
Always calling my phone fi le ahh she no gree
She said she wanted to be mine
That my koko just dey wild
So tell me why me o
But it was a one night stand
Baby don't u understand
So tell me why me o why me o
Why me o you dey try me o
You dey try me o you dey try me o
You dey try me tell me why me
That wasn't enough
Wanted to take me home to her mom
When I heard some cold comments off her mouth
I suggest she leave me alone why me
Yes I insist why me tell the truth And don't lie to me
Said u wanna get grimey
But now u wanna come tie me
U don see mugu u don see mugu
This doesn't feel too good this doesn't feel too good
I no do give me my space
I no want commot for my face
I say no abi u dey crase
This thing don dey turn to disgrace
She wouldn't leave me alone
Always calling my phone fi le ahh she no gree
She said she wanted to be mine
That my koko just dey wild
So tell me why me o
But it was a one night stand
Baby don't u understand
So tell me why me o why me o
Why me o you dey try me o
You dey try me o you dey try me o
You dey try me tell me why me
Sweet cinderella

Don't know what I am gonna tell her
Maybe I should try some accapella
Let's go
Humming
She said she wanted to be mine
That my koko just dey wild
So tell me why me o
But it was a one night stand
Baby don't u understand
So tell me why me o why me o
Why me o you dey try me o
