Raise your glasses in the air
Do it like you don't care
We live another day, so let's celebrate
Raise your glasses in the air
Do it like you don't care
We live another day, so let's celebrate
I'm in the club and I'm feeling the beat
So I grab some Hennessy to give me the trips
Wanna get my groove on
I'm here to party
I no come here to sit
I'm in the club and I am feeling the beat
And I got my kokolet bringing the heat
I got my groove on
I'm here to party
I no come here to sit
You might also like
Soup e no sweet
Except e don done
The party never start until D'Banj come
So pass me the Hennessy
'Cause o di dandan
If I go rock your body
You go shake your bum bum

You don't know me
There's nothing you can do that could stop me, ha
I got my henne-lee
Come join the party
Oya let us jubilate

Raise your glasses in the air
Do it like you don't care
We live another day, so let's celebrate
I propose a toast
For my peeps from coast to coast
We all be blending
I'm in the club and I'm feeling the beat
So I grab some Hennessy to give me the trips
Wanna get my groove on
I'm here to party
I no come here to sit
I'm in the club and I am feeling the beat
And I got my kokolet bringing the heat
I got my groove on
I'm here to party
I no come here to sit
