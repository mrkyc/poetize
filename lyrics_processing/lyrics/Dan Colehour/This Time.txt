Through the souls of both of my shoes
Tread's wearing thin but knows where i've been and all i stand to lose
I've been buying time by the interstate on this roadway dock loading freight
Some nights when the trucks run late i step out back and stare
Off into that open sky and i dream about slipping away
Hey baby that's me and you takin' a chance or two
Going straight to the highway
Just lie and listen to that engine burnin'
Turnin' those four wheels just as fast as they can go
And roll down the window and you might just feel the morning
Blowing in from someplace that the likes of us will never know
'bout a mile down at the amoco
Amy's 'hind the counter sellin' her soul
To a nine to five job she don't wanna to know or care too much about
She's just tryin' to make herself an easy buck
She can roll into this old pick-up truck
Gonna drive her into town and with a little luck we'll turn a head or two
No the ride won't last too long but man, she won't care
She just wants to feel the wind whipping through her long blond hair
Going straight to the highway
Just lie and listen to that engine burnin'
Turnin' those four wheels just as fast as they can go
And roll down the window and you just might feel the morning
Blowing in from someplace that the likes of us will never know
You might also likeThis town's gonna get us down if it gets up under our skin
Yeah baby we were born to lose but we're bound to win
Going straight to the highway
Just lie and listen to that engine burnin'
Turnin' those four wheels just as fast as they can go
And roll down the window and you might feel the morning
Blowing in from someplace that the likes of us will never know
