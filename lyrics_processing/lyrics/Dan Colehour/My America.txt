The sound of that tread wearing thin, ever felt as good
As it does tonight on this highway
With my hands wrapped around this chevrolet
It's just ten more miles till the light of day rises up across the land
And reminds me of a time when this whole damn town was mine
Long before i set out to find a piece of my america
My daddy weren't no business man
Tried the best he could with that bottom land
But we were always living second hand
And for me that wouldn't do
Soon as high school set me free, i turned my back on tennessee
Was gonna show 'em all who i could be, before i lost my nerve
I lit out for tim-buck-two, leaving everything i knew
Just trying to make a dream come true, somewhere, in my america
And i'll tell you what i learned out there on the road
You were easier to find than i had ever thought
For all my searching far and wide
You were right here waiting, deep inside my heart
I guess i was to blind to see, you were right in front of me
My america
As i pulled up on that gravel drive
And the back porch screen door opened wide
My daddy smiled and my mama cried as i fell into open arms
You know i never heard i told you so
But if i had i'd a let 'em know
To find my way i had to go where ever that road might lead
But the easiest stretch i found was from the moment i turned around
And started walking back down familiar ground
Home... to my america

You were easier to find than i had ever thought
For all my searching far and wide
You were right here waiting, deep inside my heart
I guess i was to blind to see, you were right in front of me
