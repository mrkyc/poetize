Mission check
Life support system check
Mic biorhythm check
Weapons check
Engine check
T minus 30 all hands on deck
For the one man mission I command respect
So I jet it I headed for planet x
So prepare to blast off
It's time to catch ?
To make contact or communication
With some strange alien civilization
Perhaps to join the galactic federation
Pass the medication 'cause my heart is racin'
Light the ? Mic the flow
Paranormal psychic flow
The perfect night to go
The people have the right to know
I got a small load of rocket fuel
And a nuclear engine that I built in school
And an ak1200 'cause I pack tools
Permission from my professor 'cause i'm so cool
This is why I came
You know the name
I ignite the flame
Missile from my fighter plane
Spacecraft play it back
You can't ignore this
? Rhymes ? This
Lyrics or the mic that the emperor flips
Have a cloaking device like a klingon warship

Forward or rewind that
Smoke it like a dime sack
We makin' contact
Drum n bass hot track
Rewind that
Smoke it like a dime sack
Now we makin' contact
Drum n bass
Time and space
Laser pistol by my waist
Pull the trigger and hide my face
Will they fire back but wait
Is this my destiny
Have you come to question me
Who sent you to rescue me and use mental telepathy
I said I came from a small green planet
I'm low on fuel and that's why I landed
A million light-years away and now i'm stranded
Take me to your leader or at least a mechanic
Is this something I can fix
Do you know who you rockin' with
? Help I must admit
Please prepare my rocket ship
Fix my hyperdrive
Set me up with some new supplies
I'm lucky to be alive
This planet can't survive
Your technology is so advanced
To disrupt your society was not my plan
And just when I thought I didn't have a chance
I did the universal greeting
The b-boy stance
Drum n bass hot track
Supply the rhymes jack
Combine that
We make contact
Drum n bass hot track
Supply the rhymes jack
Now that we combine that
We just make contact
Drum n bass hot track
Forward or rewind that
Smoke it like a dime sack
We makin' contact
Drum n bass hot track
Rewind that
Smoke it like a dime sack
We makin' contact
I be the master of the hip hop trade
To invade drum n bass i'm not afraid
When I complete a mission and contact is made
With the mike, the audience and the beat that's played
I supply the rap ak ? The track
My life on earth is wack
I ain't never goin back
Light it up or get back
They gave me a jet pack
Maybe now they won't attack
'Cause we made contact
Contact
Makin' contact
Smoke it like a dime sack
Rewind that
Contact
We makin' contact
Drum n bass hot track
Makin' contact
Forward or rewind that
We makin' contact
Rewind that
