You're that whisper in my head
You're the perfume on my dirty shirt
The favorite words I've ever said
You're the edge I just stepped off of
You're the sunlight through my window pane
You're the road I wanna break down on
In the pouring rain
'Cause I know I'm not easy to hold
But you've reached me, baby
You saved me from me before I was too far gone
Girl, I love you for taking me on
I spent my life just spinning my wheels
But I wasn't getting nowhere fast
You took my foot off the gas
You brought me miles from where you found me
And now I ain't going back
'Cause I know I'm not easy to hold
But you've reached me, baby
You saved me from me before I was too far gone
Girl, I love you for taking me on
You might also likeI was lost, I was wrong, I was searching
I was reckless and helpless and hurting
(Taking me on)
You were strong enough to carry me all the way
'Cause I know I'm not easy to hold
But you've reached me, baby
You saved me from me before I was too far gone
(Too far gone)
Girl, I love you for taking me on
I was lost, I was wrong, I was searching
I was reckless and helpless and hurting
(Taking me on)
I was lost, I was wrong, I was searching
I was reckless and helpless and hurting
I was lost, I was wrong, I was searching
I was reckless and helpless and hurting
(Taking me on)
I was lost, I was wrong, I was searching
I was reckless and helpless and hurting
I was lost, I was wrong, I was searching
I was reckless and helpless and hurting
I was lost, I was wrong, I was searching
I was reckless and helpless and hurting
I was lost, I was wrong, I was searching
I was reckless and helpless and hurting
I was lost, I was wrong, I was searching
