And you worked all week
And you need a place you can let it go
Where the girls go wild
And the boys play hard
And you need a little more than just the radio
Well here's your open invitation
With just a couple regulations:
Let me warn you son
Only come to have fun
We don't take kindly to serious
So leave your troubles at the door
Unless you want some in here
Welcome to my house
Buckle up tight
Everybody sings and drinks and laughs and gets high
It's a country music
A little soul
It's a rock 'n roll rodeo
We don't tolerate no sittin' around
Everybody's dancin', groovin' and gettin' on down
So before you come in here with some kinda attitude
You better read the house rules
Around 11 o'clock
When the front door locks
And the boys start raising the bottle
Where the girls do the thing with the Mardi Gras beads
Yeah you know they're gonna show 'em if they got 'em
And no matter what your story
A good time is mandatory
Well rule number 7 says don't touch the women
But they can grab whatever they want to... (hahaha)

There's no such thing as last call
We pick 'em up when they fall
We share the same bathroom stall
Says the sign on the wall
One, two, three!
Welcome to my house
Buckle up tight
Everybody sings and drinks and laughs and gets high
It's a country music
A little soul
Man, it's a rock 'n roll rodeo
We don't tolerate no sittin' around
Everybody's dancin', groovin' and gettin' on down
So before you come in here with some kinda attitude
Boy before you come walking in here
With any kinda attitude
Lord, you better read the house rules!
Oh son you better read the house rules!
Two , three, JAY!
You better read the house rules
'Cuse me
Excuse me
