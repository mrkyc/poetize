And she was lovin' on his rough neck
And she was talking about running away
And he was puffin' on a cigarette
Just thinkin' (huh)
How am I gonna say goodbye?
He said, girl you got it good here
And you don't need to mess with
A guy going nowhere
She said how's about Texas?
He got up and shook his head
Then he said, ain't you been listening?
It's never gonna work out
And I think it'd be a good time now to
Let me go
You don't need me baby
Stop holding on the way you are
Don't you know I'm no good for you
And it'll only break your heart
If you don't
Let me go
He said other than a dreamer
I ain't nothin' but a drifter
You could do a lot better
Then leaned over and he kissed her
He said you got another year of college
And a good momma and a daddy
And me, I got $93 in this old '82 Chevy

You don't need me baby
Stop holding on the way you are
Don't you know I'm no good for you
And it'll only break your heart
If you don't
Let me go
She said, nice try
But you can't hide behind those shades there on your face
Ya see I don't think you're all that tough
I just think you're scared of love
And I think I won't take up that much space
(So)Let me go
Take me with you baby
It's so cold outside your arms/I belong where you are (DEPENDING ON SONG VERSION)
We both know that you're not as strong as you think you are
So let me go
Take me with you baby
I belong where you are
Don't you know I'm so good for you
And it'll only break your heart
Down the road
If you don't
Let me go
With you baby
Let me go
With you baby
