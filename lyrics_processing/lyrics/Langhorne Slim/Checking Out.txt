Sometimes i don't recognize
He house I live in
Or the street that my house is on
Sometimes I don't recognize
Sometimes i don't recognize
The patterns on my shirt
Or the way my shoes are tied
We know the way things go down
We know a lot of people
For people in a small town
We know a lot of people
We know the way things go down
Sometimes I don't recognize
That leads me to be surprised
On my way home I'm walkin' home
For the first time
Sometimes I don't sympathize
With all the sick and the tired
Whats in it being a bum
Whats in it being admired

And it's just too much trouble
We know the smells and the sound
We know a lot of people
We know the way things go down
Well I can fight like the devil
