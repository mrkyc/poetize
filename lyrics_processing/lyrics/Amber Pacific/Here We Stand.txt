Another day has passed us
With its lack of change
And all we have is what we share
And all we want is someone else to be there
And if the sun will set tonight
Hold our secrets up to the sky
As our shadows grow there's nothing left to hide
And if you ever doubt
You will know that I still wonder
How many times did I compare
The stars to your eyes
We will make it through
No matter the cost
We've gone this far
Why not find out how it works out
For you and me
We'll make it through
I thought we were lost
But somehow we haven't found a way
And I hope that we never do
It's hard to get to understand
When all your lives in our hands
And don't stop when you've never been closer
Just 'cause you don't know what matters most
So it won't always be so clearly right in front of us

Hold our secrets up to the sky
As our shadows grow there's nothing left to hide
And if you ever doubt
You will know that I still wonder
How many times did I compare

No matter the cost
We've gone this far
Why not find out how it works out
For you and me
We'll make it through
I thought we were lost
But somehow we haven't found a way
And I hope that we never do
Never do
Doesn't really matter how it all began
Forsaken
Got this far without knowing who we truely are
I will never doubt that
We will make it through
No matter the cost
We've gone this far
Why not find out how it works out
For you and me
We'll make it through
I thought we were lost
But somehow we haven't found a way
