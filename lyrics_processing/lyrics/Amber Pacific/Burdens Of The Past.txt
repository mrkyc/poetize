There's a truth for every word
To be the one to take what's handed
At a loss I fear the worst
Is yet to come as I hold back tonight
I've felt it for some time
To know that fear will find this space inside
A place I just can't hide
I swore I'd never change, I'd be the same
Here and now I stand
With a choice to take away everything
Somewhere, somehow I've lost my way
What this means to me, won't change a thing
I still believe and hope
That this life will bring to me everything
Somewhere, somehow I'll find my way
I'll find my way
I swear I've lived for every moment
I have bled for those who've tried
To say I've lost my sense to show this
What it takes to stay alive
You might also likeI swore I'd never change, I'd be the same
Here and now I stand
With a choice to take away everything
Somewhere, somehow I've lost my way
What this means to me, won't change a thing
I still believe and hope
That this life will bring to me everything
Somewhere, somehow I'll find my way
I'll find my way
It's more than these walls, we've built up inside
We see it in images frozen in time
But we won't give this up tonight
It's more than these walls, I've built up inside
To see that it's killing our will to try
But we can try to make this right
I swore I'd never change, I'd be the same
Here and now I stand
With a choice to take away everything
Somewhere, somehow I've lost my way
What this means to me, won't change a thing
I still believe and hope
That this life will bring to me everything
Somewhere, somehow I'll find my way
