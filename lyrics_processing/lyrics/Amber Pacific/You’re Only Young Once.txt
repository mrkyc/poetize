I'm living inside with the words you say
Its killing me
How youre always bringing me down
So put to rest this breath that I can't forget
These marks just left on the side of his neck
Its killing me now
Youre always bringing me down
You never learn to expect the worst
It always takes just the slightest little turn
To open up your eyes
And though it seems like we're all you changed
Youll never learn cos youll always be the same
Predictable inside
The way you are
Its not your fault you knew that
The way we were
So young and caught up in it
Too far to see how fakes can be
I thought I knew who you were
You never learn to expect the worst
Youre falling short of every line that youve rehearshed
Its opened up my eyes
And now youll see that we've grown to change
A contradiction to the lives that we have made
You might also likeStill I miss you deep inside
The way you are
Its not your fault you knew that
The way we were
So young and caught up in it
Too far to see how fakes can be
I thought I knew who you were
Just close your eyes and dream of how you want your life to be
A better way, don't run away from all that you can see
Just trust that yours is long
The way you are
Its not your fault you knew that
The way we were
So young and caught up in it
Too far to see how fakes can be
I thought I knew who you were
The way you are
Its not your fault you knew that
The way we were
We're just so caught up in it
Too far to see how fakes can be
I thought I knew who you were
I thought I knew who you were
