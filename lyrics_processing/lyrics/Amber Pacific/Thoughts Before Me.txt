When you can't promise happy endings?
It's starting to get old
That story that untold
Reflect before we walk into
What we already know
Won't be so easy
Looking back at high school drama
Didn't try to fix what we thought were problems
Done with writing empty letters
Is there no other way?
Staring at your reflection every day
Can make or break my heart away
When you won't listen to what's hard for me to say
Those tear stained eyes can make me feel so sad
And once again we're further away from what we never had
So why should I take your hand
When you can't promise happy endings?
Just run away with so much left to share
It's just not enough
When we're so much more than friends
We're much too young to throw away our cares
You might also likeThere's no sense in regretting what's been said in our yesterdays
We're getting backwards double
We can look ahead
And I would walk so much further just to know what I'm doing here
And there's no end to what I'd give
To know just what you meant when you said
How could I feel alive
When we can't help but break our backs just to survive?
Is this another time we can't control our lives?
Those tear stained eyes can make me feel so sad
And once again we're further away from what we never had
So why should I take your hand
When you can't promise happy endings?
Just run away with so much left to share
It's just not enough
When we're so much more than friends
We're much too young to throw away our cares
How could I feel alive
When we can't help but break our backs just to survive?
Is this another time we can't control our lives?
Those tear stained eyes can make me feel so sad
And once again we're further away from what we never had
So why should I take your hand
When you can't promise happy endings?
Just run away with so much left to share
It's just not enough
When we're so much more than friends
