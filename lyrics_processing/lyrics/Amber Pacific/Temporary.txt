But that's the way it has to be
It's in my heart
I felt your world has come to rest
As if you're out on your last breath
And slowly fading with these days we choose to miss
Keep holding on
It's not to late
Don't make this seem
As if there's nothing left to be
There's so much more to life
We tend to just forget
Don't forget
It's just
Temporary
But give it time to know it's real
Before you're ready
To face it and begin to heal
Your life's worth living
For someone give their all to feel
Their heart's stopped beating
So give yourself another chance to change
With tomorrow comes a better day
You might also likeIt's time to start
To face the things that you fear most
To know you're better off alone
To stand up fighting with your will to carry on
It's only then
Will you see sides that you don't know
You're finding paths just take them slow
And step by step you'll find
It's easy to forget
Don't forget
It's just
Temporary
But give it time to know it's real
Before you're ready
To face it and begin to heal
Your life's worth living
For someone give their all to feel
Their heart's stopped beating
So give yourself another chance to say
Swear you'll live by what you know
You'll take it in don't let it go
More times than not we let them fall
It's just
Temporary
But give it time to know it's real
Before you're ready
To face it and begin to heal
Your life's worth living
For someone give their all to feel
Their heart's stopped beating
It's just temporary
Well that's the way it has to be
But ordinary
It takes away from everything
It's just temporary
