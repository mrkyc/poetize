Your holding back a side we've yet to see
Your buried six feet deep and no one cares
I'll show how to sweep them off their feet
Forget the ways they choose to be
Everything thats fake and insincere
As winds set, we'll forget
We'll move ahead, we'll find our way
As winds set, we'll forget
Its not too late
Caught up in the way life seems to make you
Feel as if you say i won't make it through
Your hanging by a thread and no one seems to care
But you'll find that in your heart i will be there
Stop buying all the things seen on t.v
Your falling into what they've made you think
You've lost the only thing that makes you feel
Ill prove it to the world for all to see
Beneath their smile they fear for the
Chance they may have missed a life thats real
As winds set, we'll forget
We'll move ahead, we'll find our way
As winds set, we'll forget
Its not too late
You might also likeCaught up in the way life seems to make you
Feel as if you say i won't make it through
Your hanging by a thread and no one seems to care
But you'll find that in your heart i will be there
Caught up in the way life seems to make you
Feel as if you say i won't make it through
Your hanging by a thread and no one seems to care
As winds set, we'll forget
We'll move ahead, we'll find our way
As winds set, we'll forget
Its not too late
Caught up in the way life seems to make you
Feel as if you say i won't make it through
The moments in our lives when all things come to
See the other side, stay strong stay true
Your hanging by a thread and no one seems to care
