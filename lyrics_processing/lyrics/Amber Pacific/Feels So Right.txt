Let's get down for the summer
Chilling all night, kicking it back
Yeah, feels so right

The Sandlot on the TV
Man, that never gets old
Late night rides and movies
Not going it alone
We packed into the backseat
Got tickets to the show
Graceland with my best friends
I'm never coming home

So let's get lost in the weekend
I'm dying to try
Making memories and feeling alive

Let's get down for the summer
Chilling all night, kicking it back
Yeah, feels so right like summer
This is the life
We don't give a damn and we're doing just fine
We'll make the great escape
And we won't have to wait on summer
Chilling all night, kicking it back
Yeah, feels so right

We jumped into the wagon
We left to see the Gorge
The Warped Tour's getting started
I dreamed of something more
A band with all my best friends
They said it'd never happen
Oh, I'm pretty sure we left them wanting more

So let's get lost in the weekend
I'm dying to try
Making memories and feeling alive

Let's get down for the summer
Chilling all night, kicking it back
Yeah, feels so right like summer
This is the life
We don't give a damn and we're doing just fine
We'll make the great escape
And we won't have to wait on summer
Chilling all night, kicking it back
Yeah, feels so right

We talked for nights in the basement of how we would make it
Honest, it hurt like hell with you gone
I swear I'll never forget that the reason we started was giving you hope
Let's get down for the summer
Chilling all night, kicking it back
Yeah, feels so right like summer
This is the life
We don't give a damn and we're doing just fine
We'll make the great escape
And we won't have to wait on summer
Chilling all night, kicking it back
Yeah, feels so right
