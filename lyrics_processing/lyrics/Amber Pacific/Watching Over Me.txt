No chance that we will make it, You've faked it for so long
But I'm standing here before for you, as your barely holding on
And I'm writing just to show you, there strength in who you are
We live and we fall, but Ill try to move on
It's so hard to be the one that's on my own
We live and we fall, but I'll keep moving on
It's so hard to be the one that's on my own
From the night, I can faintly here you breathing, I know that you're around
I can feel your arms around me, Ill take the water down
But I'm standing here before you, as your deep within this ground
And I'm writing just to show you, that in me you can be found
We live and we fall, but Ill try to move on
It's so hard to be the one that's on my own
We live and we fall, but I'll keep moving on
It's so hard to be the one that's on my own
You mean more then me now, it's gone forever
I won't forget, I'll make things better
With you are more then I will ever be
You were there when I lived for you to guide me
Through all the times that I spent feeling
True to the sense that you were there for me
You might also likeWe live and we fall, but Ill try to move on
It's so hard to be the one that's on my own
We live and we fall, but I'll keep moving on
It's so hard to be the one that's on my own
We live and we fall, but Ill try to move on
It's so hard to be the one that's on my own
We live and we fall, but I'll keep moving on
It's so hard to be the one that's on my own
