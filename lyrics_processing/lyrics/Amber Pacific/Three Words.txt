Don't wanna play 'cause I'm outta luck
In this town, in this town
Tomorrow I'll be in another state
I get so nervous 'cause I just can't wait to see you
I guess I need you
Don't believe everything you read about me
Read about me, it doesn't matter what they say
I know you're always waiting for a status update
It comes a little too late
Can't stop thinking, I'm to blame
'Cause you're ready for the next one
The distance killed the burning flame
And I can't stop myself from trying to figure out
The fastest way to work this out
'Cause I'm ready for you
Three words can't fix us anymore
I believe you've been working nine to five
I know you miss me but you try to hide your feelings
'Cause I gave you reasons
You might also likeI remember when you took your breaks
You called to tell me all about your day
I miss that, why can't we fix that?
Don't believe everything you read about me
Read about me, it doesn't matter what they say
I know you're always waiting for a status update
It comes a little too late
Can't stop thinking, I'm to blame
'Cause you're ready for the next one
The distance killed the burning flame
And I can't stop myself from trying to figure out
The fastest way to work this out
'Cause I'm ready for you
Three words can't fix us anymore
Can't fix us anymore
Three words can't fix us anymore
Can't stop thinking, I'm to blame
'Cause you're ready for the next one
The distance killed the burning flame
Can't stop thinking, I'm to blame
'Cause you're ready for the next one
The distance killed the burning flame
And I can't stop myself from trying to figure out
The fastest way to work this out
'Cause I'm ready for you
Three words can't fix us anymore
Can't stop thinking, I'm to blame
'Cause you're ready for the next one
The distance killed the burning flame
And I can't stop myself from trying to figure out
The fastest way to work this out
'Cause I'm ready for you
