I hope you've made the best of your time
With the ones who matter most, the ones who care
Your little world that's hard to just fit in
You're searching for your place amongst your friends
Tough it seems that everyone
Will hide behind this game
It's all for you all I've done I'd do again
From deep inside all my life I'm living in
From right to wrong back to right to wrong again
It's just a stage, I'll play it out, it's script to this
From being true to being used is how we live
But you don't have to be like them
You don't have to be like them
So now's the time to take a look around
I hope you see the world done inside out
It's not a perfect life that we all live in (that we
All live in)
You always seem to put yourself ahead
You never looked at yourself like we did
Now it seems that everyone has turned on you again
It's all for you all I've done I'd do again
From deep inside all my life I'm living in
From right to wrong back to right to wrong again
It's just a stage, I'll play it out, it's script to this
From being true to being used is how we live
But you don't have to be like them
(You don't have to be like them)
You might also likeI don't wanna be there
You're just another programme
You're running out of reasons
To say you're wrong
It's all for you all I've done I'd do again
From deep inside all my life I'm living in
From right to wrong back to right to wrong again
It's just a stage I'll play it out, it's script to this
From being true to being used is how we live
But you don't have to be like them
It's all for you all I've done I'd do again
From deep inside all my life I'm living in
From right to wrong
Back to right to wrong again
It's just a stage
I'll play it out, it's script to this
From being true to being used is how we live
But you don't have to be like them
I know you'll never be like them
I tried to make you see
That you were all I need
I'd change my ways for you
Our lives look only true
In time you'd make me see
That you were there for me
I'd give my best for you
