Like a prisoner waiting to be freed
Like an island from afar
When you listen to your soul, do you feel me and
Do you hear me in your heart?
Maybe I'm a dreamer
Or maybe I am just fallin' apart
I put it all on the table for you to see
That you and I, that's what we are

From this lonely coastline to New Orleans
I may have lost my way, but I still
Know what it means to be
Loved, by you, by you

We're all just searching, for something new
But I'm still waiting, waiting for you
Waiting for you, I'm still, waiting for you
Waiting for you, I'm still, waiting for you

Like a soldier wounded in a war
Like the tide that washed away
Do you listen to yourself anymore and
Do you hear me when I say?
That maybe I'm just lonely
Or maybe I'm just fallin' for you
Oh, baby my heart is beating
From the reasons that I always knew
You might also like
From this lonely coastline to New Orleans
I may have lost my way, but I still
Know what it means to be
Loved, by you, by you

We're all just searching, for something new
But I'm still waiting, waiting for you
Waiting for you, I'm still, waiting for you
Waiting for you, I'm still, waiting for you
Oh, oh, ooohh
Oh, oh, ooohh
Oh, oh, ooohh, oh
Oh, oh, ooohh
Oh, oh, ooohh
Oh, oh, ooohh, oh

From this lonely coastline to New Orleans
I may have lost my way, but I still
Know what it means to be
Loved, by you, by you

We're all just searching, for something new
But I'm still waiting, waiting for you
Waiting for you, I'm still, waiting for you
Waiting for you, I'm still, waiting for you
Oh, oh, ooohh
Oh, oh, ooohh

Oh, oh, ooohh, oh
Oh, oh, ooohh
Oh, oh, ooohh
Oh, oh, ooohh, oh

Oh, oh, ooohh
Oh, oh, ooohh
Oh, oh, ooohh, oh
Oh, oh, ooohh
Oh, oh, ooohh
