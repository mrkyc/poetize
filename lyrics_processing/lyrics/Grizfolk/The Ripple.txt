Struck gold uptown in Chicago
Roll into West Coast time sometime tomorrow
I spend my money, I can't seem to drink slow
Rolling on my highs and lows
Rolling on my high

It was all so simple back when we were on the run
Forever stay easy, forever we'll be young
We'll be building up the road and carrying the load
Whatever starts the ripple always leads us to where we belong

Oh, oh, my, my, gotta get lost to get it right
Oh, oh, my, my, gotta get lost to get it right

I'm just a Southern boy, swamplands of Florida
Who found love in the desert of California
I got lost in the dust just to know you
Rolling on my highs and lows
Rolling on my high

It was all so simple back when we were on the run
Forever stay easy, forever we'll be young
We'll be building up the road and carrying the load
Whatever starts the ripple always leads us to where we belong

Oh, oh, my, my, gotta get lost to get it right
Oh, oh, my, my, gotta get lost to get it right
Something's gotta give
Something's gotta live on, live on

It was all so simple back when we were on the run
Forever stay easy, forever we'll be young
We'll be building up the road and carrying the load
Whatever starts the ripple, whatever starts the ripple
It was all so simple back when we were on the run
Forever staying easy, forever we'll be young
We'll be building the road, yeah, carrying the load
Whatever starts the ripple always leads us to where we belong

Oh, oh, my, my, gotta get lost to get it right
Oh, oh, my, my, gotta get lost to get it right
Oh, oh, my, my, gotta get lost to get it right
