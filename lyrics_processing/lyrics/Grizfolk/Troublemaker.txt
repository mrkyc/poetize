If I could love you in the right way
I wouldn't let you down before I go
I woke up in a black haze
Tomorrow I'll be plowing through the snow

Your heart is strong, yeah, your back hand is made of gold
These lights don't work and these tires are getting old

Can I put you in my pocket and save you for later?
Cause you're too good to lose; you're the flavor I savor
Can I put you in my pocket and save you for later?
Cause you're the trouble I want, you're my troublemaker
You're my troublemaker
You're my troublemaker

I'd chase you for a lifetime
If you'd leave me with a thrill I can't contain
With emptiness by my side
I'll always have a place to hide the pain

Your heart is strong, yeah, your back hand is made of gold
These lights don't work and these tires are getting old

Cause you're too good to lose; you're the flavor I savor
Can I put you in my pocket and save you for later?
Cause you're the trouble I want, you're my troublemaker
You're my troublemaker
You're my troublemaker

The trouble in you is the trouble in me
The trouble in you is the trouble in me
I know it's wrong but I love it
If you give it I'll take it
Cause you're the trouble I want, you're my troublemaker

Can I put you in my pocket and save you for later?
Cause you're too good to lose; you're the flavor I savor
Gonna put you in my pocket and save you for later
Cause you're the trouble I want, you're my troublemaker
Can I put you in my pocket and save you for later?
Cause you're too good to lose; you're the flavor I savor
Gonna put you in my pocket and save you for later
