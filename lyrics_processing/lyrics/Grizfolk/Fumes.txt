I feel the tension, the rising water line
Afraid to mention the truth this time
If we don't speak now, no one's winning
No one's winning, no one's winning

Can't carry no more
Can't carry the weight no more
Can't carry no more
Can't carry the weight no more

So, do you sing like nobody's listening?
And do you dance like nobody's there?
There's a love that could be limitless
So, why are we so scared?
Can't carry the weight no more

Can't carry no more
Can't carry the weight no more
Can't carry no more
Can't carry the weight no more
Can't carry no more
Can't carry the weight no more
Can't carry no more
Can't carry the weight no more

Sunday's best-dressed, last week's dealings
Can't make up for these heavy feelings
Yesterday's business, heart still healing
Heart still healing, heart still healing

So, do you sing like nobody's listening?
And do you dance like nobody's there?
'Cause there's a love that could be limitless
So, why are we so scared?
Can't carry the weight no more

Can't carry no more
Can't carry the weight no more
Can't carry no more
Can't carry the weight no more
Can't carry no more
Can't carry the weight no more
Can't carry no more
Can't carry the weight no more

So, I sing like nobody's listening
And I dance like nobody's there
'Cause there's a love that could be limitless
So, why are we so scared? (Can't carry the weight no more)
So, do you sing like nobody's listening? (Can't carry the weight no more)
And do you dance like nobody's there? (Can't carry the weight no more)
There's a love that could be limitless (Can't carry the weight no more)
So, why are we so scared? (Can't carry the weight no more)
