Hello, nice to meet you
I guess that's a nice place to start
Maybe hell will freeze through
Oh baby, let me thaw your heart

Up against the world
And the world is on your shoulders
You're up against time
And the new is getting older

I don't wanna lose myself
Well, I don't wanna lose that feeling
'Cause you make me wanna lose myself in you
You got me believing
You got me believing

(You got me, you got me
You got me, you got me)

Where have the miles gone?
We're only livin' on borrowed time
And I wanna live long
I wanna live like it's 1969
You might also like
Up against the world
The world is on your shoulders
You're up against time
The new is getting older

I don't wanna lose myself
Well, I don't wanna lose that feeling
'Cause you make me wanna lose myself in you
You got me believing
You got me believing

(You got me, you got me
You got me, you got me
You got me believing)

If you're wondering why
I'm taking it slowly
A lifetime is a long, long, long time
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna lose that feeling
You make me wanna lose myself in you
You got me believing
You got me believing

Don't wanna lose myself
(You got me, you got me
You got me, you got me)
Don't wanna lose myself
(You got me believing)
Don't wanna lose myself
(You got me, you got me
You got me, you got me)
Don't wanna lose myself
(You got me believing)

I don't wanna, I don't wanna
