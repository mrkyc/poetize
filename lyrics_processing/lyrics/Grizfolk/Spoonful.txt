You give me just a little, just to get me by
Just a spoonful, it's never enough to hold me over
Just a little bit, just to get me by
Just a spoonful, it's never enough to hold me over

Leavin' a wake
Leavin' a big, big scar
For good times' sake
Show me that two-step once more

Never look back, when we were wild and free
Never let go of a good reason to believe

You give me just a little, just to get me by
Just a spoonful, it's never enough to hold me over
Just a little bit, just to get me by
Just a spoonful, it's never enough to hold me over

Just enough to hold me over
It's never enough to hold me over
You might also like
I wish you the best
It's gonna be a long, long ride
You should get some rest
Right here by my side

Never look back, when we were wild and free
Never let go of a good reason to believe

You give me just a little, just to get me by
Just a spoonful, it's never enough to hold me over
Just a little bit, just to get me by
Just a spoonful, it's never enough to hold me over

If the plan don't come easy
Then the pain, it won't leave me
And I don't want to fight it no more
Fight it no more

You give me just a little, just to get me by
Just a spoonful, it's never enough to hold me over
Just a little bit, just to get me by
Just a spoonful, it's never enough to hold me over
You give me just a little, just to get me by
Just a spoonful, it's never enough to hold me over
Just a little bit, just to get me by
