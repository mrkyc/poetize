Take it back, it's over time
Ooh, you know it's on my mind
When things were easy, and I was fine
The simple things in life are hard to find
There's a fork in the road
Still pulling that heavy load
And there's a light, there's a light
Some things in life we may never know
If winter doesn't break these bones
Winter won't break these bones

Happiness isn't just a feeling
The summer never sets, I've seen it
If there's a light in the dark, I need it now
It's stronger than a love that's fleeting
We're more than just a heart that's beating
Roll me slowly, right up to the season I love

I've been rolling like a stone
No cities left unknown
And I've been told, I've been told that
The best things in life will not get old
If winter doesn't break these bones
You might also like
Happiness isn't just a feeling
The summer never sets, I've seen it
If there's a light in the dark, I need it now
It's stronger than a love that's fleeting
We're more than just a heart that's beating
Roll me slowly, right up to the season I love

The endless summer's coming home (x4)
Winter won't break my bones (x4)

Happiness isn't just a feeling
The summer never sets, I've seen it
If there's a light in the dark, I need it now
It's stronger than a love that's fleeting
We're more than just a heart that's beating
Roll me slowly, right up to the season I love

The endless summer's coming home
The endless summer's coming home
The endless summer's coming home
The endless summer's coming home
Happiness isn't just a feeling
The summer never sets, I've seen it
It's stronger than a love that's fleeting
We're more than just a heart that's beating
Happiness isn't just a feeling
The summer never sets, I've seen it
It's stronger than a love that's fleeting
