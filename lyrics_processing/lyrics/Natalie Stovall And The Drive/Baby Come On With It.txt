Feeling like dog on real short chain
Ooh, and if you're good to go, I'm game
Baby, come on with it
We can head on out to where the kudzu grows
Beeline for the tree line on White Pine Road
Spend the p.m cranking that a.m radio
Baby, come on with it
I've been going crazy
Without you lately
Oh, baby, come on with it
Drink a little drink, sing a little song with it
Show me that wild side down by the fire side
Gimme that shimmy shimmy one more time
Oh, coming on strong with it
I could go all night long with it
Me and you and the dance we do
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Baby, come on, baby, come on with it
Well, you're making that move in your cowboy boots
Kissing on me while you're sipping on Boone's
Doing that way back, laid back thing you do
Baby, come on with it
Now, this right here's what I call living
Getting lost in every midnight minute
Just me and you and the coons and the crickets
Baby, come on with it
I've been going crazy
Without you lately
Oh, baby, come on with it
Drink a little drink, sing a little song with it
Show me that wild side down by the fire side
Gimme that shimmy shimmy one more time
Oh, coming on strong with it
I could go all night long with it
Me and you and the dance we do
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Baby, come on, baby, come on with it
Oh, baby, come on with it
Drink a little drink, sing a little song with it
Show me that wild side down by the fire side
Gimme that shimmy shimmy one more time
Oh, coming on strong with it
I could go all night long with it
Me and you and the dance we do
Ain't nothing wrong with it
