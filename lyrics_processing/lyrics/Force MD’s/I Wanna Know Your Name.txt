You just look like something I could settle down with
Let me introduce myself
My name is Little Sonny
I drive a little red Volkswagen
I like to go horse-back riding
I like all kind of sweets
Cupcakes, currants, and things like that
This is why I can't help from noticing you
Just a jazzy, jazzy ol' babe
Come on, can I have this dance
Something as groovy as this, we got to dance
Lord, have mercy
Am I holding you too tight?
Oh, I-I'm sorry, I'm sorry, 'scuse me
Ain't gonna get too close

Please tell me your name?
I'm just going to have to grab you and hold you a little closer
'Cause, I just got to

Girl, tell me your name, you sweet little thing, you
(I wanna know your name)
I could love ya, I could love ya
I could love ya all night long, all night long, all night long
Mm-hmm
Listen, what about if you give me your phone number
And I call you one Saturday afternoon
Perhaps, we'll go in town
Have a little bite to eat
And then maybe go and take in a little movie
And afterwards
I'll just drop you at the huh.. at the doorstep
And give you a little kiss
Oh, I, just, so many things that we could do
If you just tell me your name
I'm not even married
Are you married
Girl, you gotta tell me, tell me, tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)
Just wait a minute, don't leave out the door
(I wanna know your name)
Don't leave me, don't leave me, unless you tell
(I wanna know your name)
Just tell, just tell me, girl, just wait a minute
(I wanna know your name)
