It's the last one we'll ever see
It's my promise, just being honest
No one's gonna take you away from me
It's never easy
Leaving your life and living a dream
I know it sounds crazy
Asking you to disappear with me
If we don't go home, the sun won't set
If we run right now, we won't regret
And we can close our eyes and just pretend
That it's the last day of summer
And when the leaves fall down
We'll be long gone
If you just stay right here inside my arms
Then tomorrow morning never comes
Every day we have each other
Will be the last day of summer
Last day of summer x2
The city gets smaller as we go further
Making our way to obscurity
The world we once knew is down to me and you
You're the only light I'll ever need
It's never easy
Leaving your life and living a dream
I know it sounds crazy
Asking you to disappear with me
If we don't go home, the sun won't set
If we run right now, we won't regret
And we can close our eyes and just pretend
That it's the last day of summer
And when the leaves fall down
We'll be long gone
If you just stay right here inside my arms
Then tomorrow morning never comes
Every day we have each other
Will be the last day of summer
Last day of summer x4
If we don't go home, the sun won't set
If we run right now, we won't regret
And we can close our eyes and just pretend
That it's the last day of summer
And when the leaves fall down
We'll be long gone
If you just stay right here inside my arms
Then tomorrow morning never comes
Every day we have each other
Will be the last day of summer
