 Mama been laid off
 She ain't working no mo'
 Papa been laid off
 He say things done got slow
 My brother's been laid off
 He been locked down
 For more than two years now

My world is crumbling, times is hard they were before, but oh my god!
Mama mad at pops cause he ain't working
But today she lost her job
Now what in the fuck is we suppose to do?
We on our last loaf of bread
Got cereal, but no milk, Kool-Aid, no sugar, what the hell?
And here come Mr. Bill Collector beating down our door for dough
Mama say "When they come knockin
Y'all don't say nothing, (shhh) get on the floor"
Kind of hard to see at night in a house when it ain't got no lights and shit
No gas or water, had to borrow H2O from my relative
Man, it feels like I ain't even here
I'm ready to get up and get all my own, but I got three more fuckin years
Nigga 15, with a big dream to make it on out this ghetto
But the devil won't settle, fuckin up my levels he won't let go
I'm living to die it seems I just can't win
Now I'm high, but I'm stopping to realize I drunk this whole fifth of Gin
(Nigga damn!) I'm 17 and drinking like I'm grown up
I got some problems, plus I need some money
And it's really all because...

Juvenile nigga done struggling, hustling, struggling like I want it
Then fuck school, right now I'm hungry, and I can't eat that damn diploma
But on this corner I can eat every day, all I gotta do is slang this yay
Nigga, If business keep going this way me and my family is fin to be straight
I'm glad I took that fifty dollars that grandma gave me
Bought me a double up, now it's all about coming up
"I'ma pay ya back next week"
Repeat, took my ass straight to the block with a hand full of rocks, y'all
And it's my first time I'm low in, watching for cop cars
By the end of the night, a nigga sold all the rocks
I'm tripping out lookin' at all the dough I got
I shoulda been came a sold the block and locked it
Made me some profits, so nigga tonight my people gonna be eating on lobster
Hate to say it, but I think these streets done really created a monster
Cause now that I see how quick I can come up by breaking the law
Why in the hell is you steady tellin' me to go and get a job?
Fuck that, nigga this my thing right now I know
I'm walking home happy, smiling, and I ain't even thinking about...

Business was booming, so a nigga assuming I could do some improving
Like new jewels, clothes, shoes, Cadillac coupe, I'm out here doing it
Got me a cold ass broad, and that's something I never had
But I'm never mad cause I done snagged one bad one with my young ass
Once I turned 18 it was on
But my brother started writing home, telling me to leave this shit alone
I say "What?" nigga, he don't know that I'm too deep in this
I'm living and breathing the street shit
And if I don't play the crook, you ain't gonna have shit on your books, look
"Gimme a minute, I'll chill in a minute I promise I will
As soon as I finish this last load
I'ma drop this dice after this last roll"
Little did he know, I got no intentions on leaving this shit here
I'm finna get rich here
When you get out, you'll have some shit here if you still care
Made enough money to move my moms and pops to a new pad
They was suspicious, but they ain't tripping
Cause this more shit than we ever had
But shit went bad, 6 in the morning crashing through my door was the Feds
And they want that bread, "We want you," and I'm like "Ooh!" (shit)
Shoulda listened to my brother, huh?
But I'm like fuck it now
Mama got to bugging out when them popo got to cuffing pops
Now I'm in the courtroom when they asked me how I plea
I tell the Judge straight up, "I've been having problems and it's all because..."
