I've been all over the world, still can't find my place
I've been all over the world, still can't find my place
So I've been getting bored
I've been getting bored
I've been getting bored, getting really, really bored

I want to build a brand new place, a brand new town, a brand new face
I want to build a brand new place, a brand new town, a brand new face
I want to build a brand new place, a brand new town, a brand new face
I want to build a brand new place, a brand new town, a brand new face
I want to build a brand new place, a brand new town, a brand new face (A brand new everything)
I want to build a brand new place, a brand new town, a brand new face (A brand new everything)

I wanna go to another level where humans have never been before
Nobody can break the concentration, I'm in my zone
Nobody can fade me or hate me 'cause I got my own
Livin' life in paradise so I can chill now
Need no more fakers around so we can all be real now
Nobody thinkin' none of us claim my niggas still down
Every time we pull up beside you, inside it's real loud (Loud)
So let me take my mind to a brand new place
And gather up souls to go to the brand new town
Let me rearrange and change my game face
Switch up a style, create a brand new sound
Am I perfect? On my mind, I know I'm not perfect (Perfect)
Am I perfect? On my mind, I know I'm not perfect (Perfect)

Couldn't imagine that lady like him and that
And even the matrix from the bacon streets a simple match
Now let me shoot the dice I hope nobody try to catch
I've gotta fresh flash of dreams and even that
Shine gleaming at minano where is thy water at
Why is the water black? (yeah)
Your angels good on my leader he be feeling that ya ready set lightspeed get the staff
When there is no one left this is what I seen at death
Like in the streets of Paeson and Edens Cleff
Man, that's all and I need some more rhythm yup must be the thoughts building kingdoms in my inner depths
Volcanic crevices, we levitate, get the rest
Until the babies go to sleep watching Cineflix
I'm to the moon, Alice, fuck it, I bought my own palace
Popped it, ready to see the sun, we be  buddy
