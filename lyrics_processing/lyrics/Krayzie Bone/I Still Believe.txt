No matter what, baby
No matter, no matter what they say
No matter what people say
I still believe we can still be together
No matter what, baby
No matter, no matter what they say
No matter what people say
I still believe we can still be together

Baby, I still believe (Still believe)
And it's more than my imagination
It's so real, I know we're gonna be together
Baby, I...
If you still believe (I do believe)
You'll find everything you're searchin' for, maybe more
Well, boy, you seem to be lost in uncertainty
But when you wake up feelin' alone, you never shoulda let it go
Well, baby, it always been sure (Sure)
I just wasn't too certain that yours were legitimate, genuine
Really the Real McCoy
And after all this time, you look into my eyes
And everything is still the same
My love for you will fade away
You might also like
Baby, I still believe (Still believe)
And it's more than my imagination
It's so real, I know we're gonna be together
Baby, I had a dream
And it's more than my imagination
Because I still believe we belong together

I'm still a believer of this, so stop
Just listen and look into my eyes
I want you to visualize and realize
And see that it ain't never been too easy
Being Krayzie Bone
To bitches that runnin' outta there with that persuasion
Runnin' up in my brain
Won't go insane
I figure that's why they be callin' me Krayzie 'cause I still maintain
We gonna struggle through all them hard times (Hard times)
And I can tell you that peace and happiness is hard to find
C'mon, we can get there
I'm not tryna make excuses or reasons
But these demons got me seeing things that's really been misleading me
Maybe that's just my life
Baby, I'm just a thug, coldhearted, but I can feel the love (Love)
Just keep the faith, and don't break it
Shake all the players and haters
And next thing we will make it
And I say, 'Yeah' and 'Uh huh'
You got to believe it (You gotta believe)
You got to believe
Baby, I still believe (Still believe)
No matter, no matter what they say
And it's more than my imagination (I still)
It's so real, I know we're gonna be together
(So real, you, you know, you know)
No matter, no matter what they say
Baby, I had a dream
No matter, no matter what they say
And it's more than my imagination (Baby, I had a dream)
Because I still believe we belong together
No matter, no matter what they say
It's so real, I know we're gonna be together

If you wanna view paradise (If you want)
Think about our lovin', baby (To view it)
Nothing could be closer to it (Nothing comes)
If we don't believe, we'll lose it (Let's do it)

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
If you can believe I can take you there
Come on and get down with the thug love that's in the air
It ain't no reason, -reason
Reason to stop your believin', -lievin'
Stay real and I'm a stay real right back
You know what I'm gettin' at
You the song
"Gotta get control and roll roll roll on"
I still believe in keepin' it real enough to achieve it
I still  believe simply just 'cause I still believe it
I believe it
Baby, I still believe (I still believe)
And it's more than my imagination
It's so real, I know we're gonna be together
(I know we will, I know we will)
Baby, I had a dream
And it's more than my imagination (I had a dream)
Because I still believe we belong together
(We will be in love again, my love)
Baby, I still believe
(It's so real I know we're gonna be together)
And it's more than my imagination (And I still believe)
It's so real I know we're gonna be together
(See, it's more than my imagination)
(I have a dream) Baby, I had a dream
And it's more than my imagination
Because I still believe we belong together
Baby, I still believe (Still believe)
No matter, no matter what they say
And it's more than my imagination
It's so real, I know we're gonna be together
No matter what, baby
No matter, no matter what they say
No matter what people say
I still believe we can still be together
