Cloudy....

Overcast in my head keep my vision cloudy
Like gloomy weather, got me down, feelin' really drowsy
Even though the sun is shining all around me
I seem to have a dark cloud, steady raining down on me
I try to shake it, can't escape it, pray for better days
Tryna find a better mindset where it never rains
I can't focus, there is too many obstacles
They say I'm hopeless, I used to pray to God before
But That's before I started hastily, chasing the devil
Living on the edge, fast paced, and raising the treble
Nobody here to help me weather through my bad storms
So my so called friends, I lost the love I've had for em'
So it's heavy rain, with a chance of a hurricane
My forever pain runs deeply in my veins
I bleed struggle so I never see the rain
But forgive me if I make the wrong decisions everything's so cloudy

I guess I'll never see the sunshine, I never get to see the early mornin' sunrise, At night I look up at the sky know that one time, I can see the stars sometimes but the sky so cloudy
It's rainin', it's pourin', it's rainin', it's stormin', it's rainin', it's pourin', it's stormin' it's so cloudy

My God it's hard to focus when your vision blurry
But my decisions make a scurry, I live in a hurry
Im plenty worried I can lose my soul, if I dont start acting like im supposed to know (better!)
I'd say a prayer but I know we prolly fed up(crazy!)
I need a blessing I'm just giving a heads up
That I'm weatherin' a bad storm, stand strong, it's the last one
And I ain't seen the sunshine, even when being on top of a world it wasn't right, And I've never been comfortable amongst the bright lights, something I'd like, believe me they living quite trife
Sometimes I feel like I might not live past the storm
Seem like its been forever and forever just keeps passing on
I can't escape this bum weather, so it's just me and my umbrella ella, ella

Why does it rain on me? Why must it rain on me? Why does it rain?

I guess I'll never see the sunshine, I never get to see the early mornin' sunrise, At night I look up at the sky know that one time, I can see the stars sometimes but the sky so cloudy

I can't see clearly, My mind is stolen
I dont want to go outside, cuz it won't stop pourin'
