Just like a politician, always playing to the crowd
Changing his position, whatever to be crowned
Yeah, and I see the store detective, he always followed me about
But man, you've gotta get real 'cause there's nothing to steal, let me out

Give it up, give it out
Wanna scream, wanna shout
Easy come, yeah, easy go, whoa, let it roll

Well, there's a bomb in New York City
Feels like we're hanging by a thread
But do you worry and fret or just try to forget? I confess I don't know

Give it up, give it out
Wanna scream, wanna shout
Easy come, yeah, easy go, whoa, let it roll
Give it up, give it out
I love you, baby, when you scream and shout
Just wanna lose control
Whoa, let it roll (Let it roll)

Give it up, give it out
Love you, baby, when you scream and shout
Just singin' hey, la la
You've got to get it, you give it to me
You've got to get it, you give it to me
You've got to get it, you give it to me
You've got to get it
Give it up, give it out
I love you, baby, when you scream and shout
Wanna feel you in my soul
Let it roll
You might also like
Give it up, give it out
Wanna scream, yeah, wanna shout
Easy come, yeah, yeah, easy go, whoa, let it roll
Give it up, give it out
I love you, baby, when you scream and shout
Before you lose your soul
Come on, let it roll (Let it roll)

Give it up, give it out
Give it up, give it out
Give it up, give it out
Give it up, give it out
Give it up, give it out
Give it up, give it out
Give it up, give it out
Give it up, give it out
Give it up, give it out
Give it up, give it out
Give it up, give it out
Give it up, give it out
