I have my problems
I have my share
I can't see any way out
I think I'm stuck here
Then I see you
I wanna kiss you
I can't explain it away
I think I love you

Do you think that we'd make it?
Without you in my life, I'd hate it
Sit about and debate it
I'm sick of hangin' around
Whoa, yeah

Girl you and me (Girl you and me)
Girl you and me (Girl you and me)
We've got to go (We've got to go)
We've got to leave (We've got to leave)
Get on a plane (Get on a plane)
Head for the sun (Head for the sun)
We've got to go (We've got to go)
We've got to run, oh, yeah

And every morning
I go to work
Pay me the minimum wage
Treat me like dirt
But when I see you
I wanna touch you
I can't explain it away
I really want you

Do you think that we'd make it?
Without you by my side, I'd hate it
Sit about and debate it
I'm sick of hangin' around
Whoa, yeah

We've got to go (We've got to go)
