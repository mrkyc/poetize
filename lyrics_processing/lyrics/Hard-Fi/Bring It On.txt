Don't write cheques that you can't cash
You've been telling lies and you're gonna crash and burn, ooh
The music's loud, try to forget the things you did, the things you said
Try to lose myself into the crowd, people here are jumping, people freaking out
Whoa, oh

Well, hold out, 'cause everything will come my way
Well, come on, 'cause I'm only gonna tell you one more time

So when you're ready, come on
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
Come on, bring it on
'Cause I'm the winner and the winner stays on, stays on

If you want trouble, it's coming your way
If you wanna war, you've only gotta say
But you can't stop once you start me up
Gotta take you out, I'm gonna fuck you up
Whoa, oh

Well, hold tight, 'cause someone's gonna take you down
Well, hold out, 'cause everything will come my way, yeah
Well, come on, 'cause I'm only gonna tell you one more time
You might also like
So if you're ready, come on
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
Come on, bring it on
'Cause I'm the winner and the winner stays on, stays on

So when you come to rip my heart out
I'll be waiting in my armour
'Cause ever since I was a small boy
It's always been like this and
You gotta try a little harder
'Because I won't let go, I won't let you, no

So when you're ready, come on
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
Come on, bring it on, yeah, yeah
'Cause I'm the winner and the winner stays on, stays on
So when you're ready, come on
Turn it on, bring it on, bring it on
Come on, bring it on, yeah, yeah
'Cause I'm the winner and the winner stays on, stays on

So get your army, go get your guns
Gonna take you down, gonna take you on
