What's the matter with your life?
Why you gotta mess with mine?
Don't keep sweating what I do
'Cause I'm gonna be just fine, check it out

If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It's none of your business
Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm giving skins to
It's none of your business
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time
It's none of your business

Now who do you think you are
Putting your cheap two cents in?
Don't you got nothing to do
Than worry 'bout my friends? Check it

I can't do nothing, girl, without somebody bugging
I used to think that it was me, but now I see it wasn't
They told me to change, they called me names, and so I popped one
Opinions are like assholes and everybody's got one
I never put my nose where I'm not supposed to
Believe me, if he's something that I want, I'm stepping closer
I'm not one for playing hypo
Like the high saditty 90210 type of ho
I treat a man like he treats me
The difference between a hooker and a ho ain't nothing but a fee
So hold your tongue tightly, wish you could be like me
You're popping all that mess only to stress and to spite me
Now you can get with that or you can get with this
But I don't give a shit, 'cause really it's none of your business

S-N-P, packing and macking
Bamboozling and smacking suckers with this track, and
Throw the beat back in

If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It's none of your business
Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm giving skins to
It's none of your business
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time
It's none of your business

How many rules am I to break before you understand
That your double-standards don't mean shit to me?
I know exactly what you say when I turn and walk away
But that's okay, 'cause I don't let it get it to me
Now every move I make, somebody's clocking
Don't ask me nothing, will you just leave me alone?
Never mind who's the guy that I took home
To bone
Okay, miss thing, never giving up skins
If you don't like him or his friends what about that Benz?
Yo, Pep-Pep's got a ill rep
With all that macaroni trap for rap, you better step
Or better yet, get your head checked
'Cause I refuse to be played like a penny cent trick deck of cards
No, I ain't hard like the bitches on a boulevard
My face ain't scarred and I don't dance in bars
You can call me a tramp if you want to
But I remember the punk who just humped and dumped you
Oh, you can front if you have to
But everybody gets horny just like you
So, yo, so, yo, ho
Check it, double-deck it on the regular butt-naked
Pep's ass gets respected, miss
But its none of your business

If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It's none of your business
Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm giving skins to
It's none of your business
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time
It's none of your business
So the moral of this story is
Who are you to judge?
There's only one true judge, and that's God
So chill, and let my Father do His job

'Cause Salt and Pepa's got it swinging again
'Cause Salt and Pepa's got it swinging again
'Cause Salt and Pepa's got it swinging again
