Just like me, just like me

Fa-sol-la T's makin' dough (Nuts?)
No, but as in big bucks
So (Huh?), so (Who?), so what the hell?
It doesn't matter who goes and buy my records, long as they sell
And I can tell that you don't like me very well
Pop-popular hit, pop hits is makin' my pockets swell
And makin' me a little rich now (Yeah, baby)
You ain't seen nothing if you think that I'm a bitch now (Check it out, check it out)
Just watch me, just watch me
I wasn't tryin' to be a hooker sellin' pootang
Up and down the block just ain't my thing
I seen a lot of women fallin' gettin' fast money
'Cause either AIDS or jail will get that ass, honey
I needed more to explore, so I tried rap
Now in 1993, I'm livin' mad fat
Check my attitude, it comes with the territory, baby
And now I'm drivin' niggas crazy

Everybody wants to get paid, paid like a lewd maid
Poppin' that coochie or sellin' fake Gucci
Whatever's in style and costs a big pile
Just to get one, niggas gettin' real foul
It's all about the great paper chase
A million dollar worth of whip appeal could even buy Babyface
So meet me on the rooftop and have my money right
'Cause I'm the new lady boss keepin' game tight

So, you think you're all that
Feelin' kinda phat
But can you see where the wrong is?
I, I don't know much about ya
But there's no doubt you're out to
Get yours any way you can
Everybody wants to be a big shot
Everybody wants to make a quick buck
Everybody wants to be on the top
