I'm your honey-dipper, so you say, you know
Then you react and attack every flirtin' ho
But oh no, you gots to go now, bro
To and fro, uh-uh, no more
So just walk out the door and be out like Margetta
I've been through this before, but now I think I better
Kick ya to the curb 'cause this hurts, word
You diss and wanna kiss? Now that's absurd, yo
Spinderella ain't the kind type to be pulled down, ya know
Before I go out, I go blow-for-blow
So tell those hoes that's sittin' there waitin' by the phone
That they can have you, 'cause you's gone

All you gotta do is just step-step
Me and you, we're through, so just step-step
All you gotta do is just step-step
I'd hate to be ya

I'm not the one to be done
You better go out and get someone else, son
Who can eat your lies when you feed it to her
And take that little thumb when you givin' it to her
'Cause you was packin' now you're lackin'
You used to be stackin' when you was the mackin'
But that's alright, it is a small thing, a small thing
A two-minute brother, girls, I stress, a small thing, yo
Back to the track and the matter
I don't need to since you think you're all of that-a
Regardless of you my purse and pockets will be fatter
I leave ya flat, I leave ya flat, I left ya flatter

All you gotta do is just step-step
Me and you, we're through, so just step-step
All you gotta do is just step-step
I'd hate to be ya

I wouldn't take you back if you paid me
It was so sweet, oh no, I can't believe ya played me
I'll admit you pulled it off kinda well
But guess what? I did it, too, so what the hell?
You reap what you sow, you know, you know how that go
I know you're kinda shocked, but it was you who showed me, so
Swallow your pride, take it in, be a man
I understood, now you understand
That the minute you started showing me neglect
Is the same minute I started feeling the effect
Why I held it in, I didn't wanna accept
That it could be over just for cheap sex
Experience is what we need to learn from
I know we all made mistakes, but you're a big one
So to the lucky man who's up next
Either treat me right or just step (Step-step)

All you gotta do is just step-step
Me and you, we're through, so just step-step
All you gotta do is just step-step
I'd hate to be ya
Step-step
Step-step
Step-step
