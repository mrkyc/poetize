Well I ain't sweet sweet hoochie coochie moody
Brown-skinned cutie with a big booty
And two big tootie-toots up front, check it
Your butt-naked premonitions have been dissed
Mr. Me-Being-A-Ho has just drifted into the abyss
So we won't twist up like pretzels
And set your sights on a bona-fide ho requisites
If any of these sentences have you confused
I'll make it simple just for you, check it

No, you can't get my number
No, I'm not going home with you after the jam
Check it out - emphatically no
No, you can't get my number
No, I'm not going home with you after the jam
Check it out - emphatically no
(Next verse, time to make your head burst)

Baby, I just met you
How could you expect me to respect you
And lay next to you in the bedroom?
And let you boom-boom pow-pow with my face down
Just because you think I'm cute?
I got suits, boots and all of your pursuits
Have led to the bed so we can go loop-de-la
So we can go loop-de-lay
I'm not your baby, I don't wanh-wanh
You pitiful excuse for a house-trained pet
You're just stress and aggravation
Just because you said come over
Don't mean I wanna smell your stinkin' breath
So...

Listen, mister, you may possess the BM
Yes, we could be friends or perhaps we could go out on a date
Then again...no
Cuz you get no wins for Salt-N-Pepa
We're more than just a pair of flavor skins
Dig it, y'all
Grand finale, we're on our way to Cali first-class
So Mr., I truly wish you would dash
And stop rubbin' up on my butt cheeks, see?!?


Hell no, now bust it
Yes, I'd like a drink, but I don't think
That you can get me drunk enough to lay with your skunk
Onion patch armpits, make me wanna hawk and spit
Hawk! Spit-tooie! Groovy guy you're not
Glances at my chest
Freshie, you're lusting for my flesh
Swole like a mole that can't find his hole
Yo, cousin, the hornets keep buzzin' as I say...
