Yo, let's talk about AIDS
Go on
To the unconcerned
And uninformed
You think you can't get it?
Well, you're wrong
Don't dismiss
Dis
Or blacklist the topic
That ain't gonna stop it
Now if you go about it right, you just might
Save your life
Don't be uptight
Come join the fight!
We're gonna tell you how you can get it
And how you won't
All of the do's
And all of the don'ts
I got some news for you so listen, please
It's not a black, white, or gay disease
Are you ready, Pep?
Yeah, I'm set
All right then, come on
Bet!

So if you do come up HIV positive
(Uh-huh)
Or have AIDS
Yeah
We just want you to know
(What?)
That there are treatments
That's right!
And the earlier
The sooner
Detected the better off you'll be
Tell 'em please
Hey, yo, Pep, you get checked?
Yep, every year, G!
Now, you don't get AIDS from kisses, touches, mosquito bites
Or huggin'
Toilet seats, telephones
Stop buggin'
You get it for sex or a dirty drug needle
Anal or oral now, people!
Women can give it to men and
Men mostly to women!
The facts are simple, right and exact
And once you get it, there's no turnin' back for you
There ain't a cure
So you gotta be sure
Protect yourself
Or don't have sex anymore
Mothers might give it to their babies through the womb
Or through birth, don't be an ass and assume
AIDS ain't got no smell or taste
It don't care about your race
You see a nice, kind face
You think you're safe?
I'm sorry, that's just not the case
There's no debate
Conversate
With your mate
And don't wait
Until it's too late!
(Don't, don't take it easy now)

Let's talk about sex (Uh-huh)
Let's talk about sex (oh, oh)

Salt Ladies, all the ladies, louder now, help me out
Come on, all the ladies
Let's practice safe sex
All right
Salt Ladies, all the ladies, louder now, help me out
Come on, all the ladies

Yo, Salt...
What?
You know what else will stop the spread of AIDS?
Uh-uh
If everybody stop cheating and messing around and just stay with one person
And wear condoms
