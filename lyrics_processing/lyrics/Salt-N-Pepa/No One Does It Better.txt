Baby (Baby, baby, baby)
Give it to me (Oh, yeah), I need it
Come and get it (I'm ready)
'Cause no one does it better
Than me (Than you, you, you)
Than me, yeah, yeah (Oh, sugar)
No one does it better than me
No one does it (Girl), no one

Yo, Mr. Don Juan, give me everything I need
I'm ready for the world, rub me down, proceed
Treat like the mic then rock me
Let's do it while you hold me in the air, don't drop me
Heavyweight boot-knocker, what you wanna do
In the waterbed room, yeah, just me and you?
I got the fever for the nook-nook
So if ya never seen a body like this, take a good look
Take a good look, bet that ass'll be hooked
Because I'm better than a good book
She can't match the cat, and when she looks at your back
She sees Salt in a passion scratch
We go 'round and 'round, so let me break it down
If she was all that, you wouldn't be here right now
You might also like
'Cause you know (I know), you know that

No one does it better (Bet no one does it like you do)
No one does it better (No one does it), better than I do (Yeah, yeah)
No one does it better (No light), better than you do (Oh, no, no, no)
No one does it (Yeah), oh baby, no one

Well, that's true, that's why you never have no beef
'Cause when the bugle is blown it's all tongue and no teeth
You're gettin' done between the sheets
And I know you don't cheat 'cause at home you gets freaked
And worked out to capacity
A good piece of ass to me, that's all you has to be
I lay ya down to the maximum
And I'm extra in the middle 'cause that's where I'm waxin' him
Honey knows where the flavor's at
Who's cat is all that, who keeps comin' back

To me, can't stay away
Gotta have it night and day just because

No one does it better (No one does it), better than I do (No, no)
No one does it better (Nobody does it like you do)
No one does it better (No one does it to me), better than I do
No one does it (Yeah, oh), oh baby, no one
You're damn right no one does it better than me
Pepa's got ways to keep ya happy
Don't put nothin' past me
If I wanna, I do, if I don't, then don't ask me
Aim to please the man and freak the man
Twenty-four seven 'cause he's the man
Got thrills and frills like a theme park
Before the chill part, you can't have an ill heart
'Cause it's definitely on when I hit the bedroom
The zoom-a-zoom-zoom in his poom-poom
Pep's the body mechanic, so don't panic
I'll let ya have it, but love ain't always automatic
I never had a complaint, never said I feel faint
I got the face of a saint, you think I am, but I ain't

'Cause you know (I know), you know that

No one does it better (Not better than you do)
No one does it better (No one does it), better than I do (No one does it)
No one does it better (Nobody does it like you do)
No one does it (Yeah, oh), oh baby, no one

No one does it better (No one), better than I do
No one does it better (Is better than you), better than I do
No one does it better (No one else, nobody is better than you), better than I do
No one does it, oh baby, no one
No one does it better (No one does it better than you, yeah), better than I do
