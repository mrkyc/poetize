Not rated R, I can flow without the B's
And the F's and the A's, gotta have the K's

One, two, three it's me, S-A-L-T
The woman to be, can't you see?
On the microphone, I stand alone, psych
Pepa P got the left, I got the right
As if you didn't know the flow got better with the weather
Fall off, never that, never
Never wack ever, I'm butter like my leather
Clever, yes, I'm a lady that's clever
Rockin' it, rippin' it, yes, I'll be kickin' it
Kickin' it, brothers be trickin' it and trickin' it
Don't stop, don't stop, I won't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop
When I hear the beat, I'll be damned not to get ill, kill
Yo, Salt, chill, what you mean chill?

Chill, I know how you feel
When I hear the beat, I wanna flip, too
Let me show you how I do
In '92 I was on the L, '93's time to get off the L
And watch my pockets swell like hell
Can't you tell how Pep be livin'?
Livin' every day, livin' like it's Thanksgiving
'Cause I got the gift to get swift on the mic
Aight, psych, 'cause I'm the type to get it hype
Get it up, get it on, that's word is bond, to the break of dawn
