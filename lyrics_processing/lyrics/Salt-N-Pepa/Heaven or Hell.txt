Why, why, boy? Ayy, yeah

Children play (Yeah), women produce (Uh-huh)
Kids killing kids just for the juice
Now Africa (Africa), is looking for the truth
(But it's gonna take a while to), enlighten the youth

In this edition of the story
No need to bore me
It can't do nothin' for me
Even Denzel Washington couldn't find any glory
In the overcrowded streets of the city
I know it's shitty
But I could do without the pity
(Baby never lived in the ghetto), or the projects
But I wear my Timb boots and Hi-Tecs, and I wrecks havoc
And if you try to play me, I won't have it
Trix are for kids, this kid is not a silly rabbit

Well, he's standin' on the corner with his system bumpin' loud
MAC-10 goin' off, sprayin' up the crowd
A whole lot of screams, a lot of broken glass
Brothers like to wear they pants fallin' off they ass
Girls today don't wear no bras
Little John Doe got a ho turnin' tricks in the bars
Grandma carries a can of Mace
And she'll stick a 45 in your face

So come and meet my man Brett (Yo, what up, Brett?)
He's smokin', but it's not a cigarette (Speak on it, Pep)
I wonder how the hell a brother lets himself
Get into somethin' he can't get out of? (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
A lot of my friends are sick and tired (Sick of who?)
The police (Word)
Rollin' on 'em, pickin' on 'em, holdin' on 'em
Hopin' that they got one of 'em
It was a drug bust, but something's weird
Well, what's the matter, Spinderella?
The way a half-a-million disappeared

Children play (Play), women produce ('Duce)
Kids killing kids just for the juice
Now Africa is looking for the truth
(But do you think the other man will), enlighten the youth?

Heaven and hell is on earth
Heaven and hell is on earth

Who gives a damn about me? (Huh?), me (what?), me
Yeah, little old me
Me, myself, and I, live or die, laugh or cry
I'm all that I got, pops, and that's a lot, huh?
I'd rather rot in jail before I ho-hop
Go 'head, me, tell 'em
They may be hard of hearing
So keep yellin' at the top of your lungs
Now everybody's got guns
They wanna be hard rock and not be a fool
That buys a history book
Not me, I'll need a clock, not rock to my hips
And that two-fifth clip to my tits
If niggas wanna rip, then I'ma have to rip shit
Ah, go for yours, 'cause you gotta
In the ghetto, you don't get a medal if you settle for the drama
She's a gangster and the other terminal cancer
Ask too many questions and my Smith & Wesson will answer
Heaven and hell is on earth
Heaven and hell is on earth

Well, everybody meet Gayle, her father's in jail
Sister's on the corner screamin', "Booty for sale"
Mom spends the night gettin' drunk with her uncle
Her brother's sellin' radios and toasters by the trunkful
See, every man she ever messed with winded up dead
Some are thrown in jail, others runnin' from the feds
(The only thing she ever loved was a piece of lead)
And that's the double-barreled pump underneath the bed

Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs and looney tunes
And some got sad songs, mad songs, and moody blues
There's good news and bad news, military coups
A rebel with no cause leadin' a pack of fools
I never lived in the slum, never shot a gun
But I'll use one, don't make me use one

Children play (Yeah, they do), women produce (Word)
Kids killing kids (Uh-huh), just for the juice
Now Africa (Uh-huh), is looking for the truth
(But it's gonna take a while to), enlighten the youth
Children play (Yeah), women produce (Yeah)
Kids killing kids just for the juice
Now Africa is looking for the truth (Is looking, is looking)
(Who you gonna think will), enlighten the youth?
Children play (Play), women produce
Kids killing kids just for the juice
Now Africa is looking for the truth (Is looking, is looking)
(But who do you think will), enlighten the youth?
Children play (They play), women produce (All day)
Kids killing kids (Kids), just for the juice (Just for the juice)
Now Africa is looking for the truth (Is looking, is looking)
(But who do you think will enlighten the youth?)
Children play (Uh-huh), women produce (Uh-huh)
Kids killing kids just for the juice (Oh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Now Africa is looking for the truth (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
(It's gonna take a while), to enlighten the youth
