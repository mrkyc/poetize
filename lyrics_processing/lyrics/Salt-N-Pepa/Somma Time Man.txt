Somebody's knockin' at my door (Yo, yo), who is it?
Somebody's ringin' my bell (Open the door), I'm comin'
Somebody's knockin' at my door (Let me in please), damn
Somebody's ringin' my bell (Come on, baby)

It's your man, driving to my house every day
Tryin' to get a play but I say no way
Keep him on a leash 'cause he's a D-O-G
Hot-diggity-dog comin' for my coochie
Boom, bam, boom, knock-knock-knock
Wakin' up my moms, wakin' up my pops, somebody call the cops
And get this fool off my stoop, see
Can you believe that your man is a groupie?
Not, not dedicated, ought to get him spayed-ed
Cut the nuts and get his shots upgraded
So what ya feed him at home? It must be bones
Give him some meat so he can leave me alone
He's a somma-time man, so what ya gonna do?
Like Eddie Murphy said, "Yes, your man, too"

He's a somma-time man, some of hers, some of mine
He's a somma-time man, get you some of the time
He's a somma-time man, some of yours, some of mine
He's a somma-time man all year 'round
He's a somma-time man, some of hers, some of mine
He's a somma-time man, get you some of the time
He's a somma-time man, some of yours, some of mine
He's a somma-time man all year 'round

Now here's a description of the saggin that I'm dissin'
If your man fits this category, then dismiss him
You gotta dig him, get rid of him, have no pity for him
Send him on his way, yeah, girl, and forget about him
He's got a problem and it's similar to drugs
Not weed, cocaine, crack or dust, it's an erection, huh
He's on a mission, a sexual transition
Addiction, affliction, so girls, sign the petition
He's a man that likes easy pickin'
Thinkin' that every girl is like easy stickin'
You gotta realize that girls are not store-bought
Like Newports, a pack of cigarettes smoked to the butt
So now I know and what I know I know is now true
You're being true to lovin' a brother that's not with you
You wanna bootie smack from the back
But if you come like that, you might catch a Dig 'Em smack
He's a somma-time man

Yo, this is dedicated to all you somma-time fools
And you know who you are
Sometimes you will, sometimes you won't
Now you see him, yo, now you don't
1993, you know what I'm sayin'?
It's time to be true to the P
'Cause this AIDS thing's goin' crazy
So don't you get caught out there, baby
He's a somma-time man, some of hers, some of mine
He's a somma-time man, get you some of the time
He's a somma-time man, some of yours, some of mine
He's a somma-time man all year 'round
He's a somma-time man, some of hers, some of mine
He's a somma-time man, get you some of the time
He's a somma-time man, some of yours, some of mine
He's a somma-time man all year 'round

He's a somma-time man, a somma-somma-time
Especially when it's hot, sex is always on his mind
Lookin', dippin' and dodgin' short skirts, no stockings
No matter who it is, long as he's boot knockin'
No protection buddy always wants to give affection
Three girls, same streets but in different section
From Lonnie, Donni, all the way to Vonni
Runnin' through girls like it's musical punani
So come one, come all, he'll try to write you off
With that greater than Tibet-time freefall
Talkin' that same old thang, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yiggity-yack-yack, brother talkin' that bullcrap
But every time he parts his lips
It's funny because I always seem to smell tihs
From June, July, August, September
All year-round, so girls, just remember, he's a somma-time man
He's a somma-time man, some of hers, some of mine
He's a somma-time man, get you some of the time
He's a somma-time man, some of yours, some of mine
He's a somma-time man all year 'round
He's a somma-time man, some of hers, some of mine
He's a somma-time man, get you some of the time
He's a somma-time man, some of yours, some of mine
