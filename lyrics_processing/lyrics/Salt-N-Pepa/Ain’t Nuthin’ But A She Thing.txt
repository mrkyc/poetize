No more sugar and spice (And everything nice)
(repeat)

It's a she thing, and it's all in me
I could be anything that I want to be
Don't consider me a minority
Open up your eyes and maybe you'll see
It's a she thing, and it's all in me
I could be anything that I want to be
Don't consider me a minority
Ladies help me out if you agree
It ain't nuthin' but a she thing (We are proud)
It ain't nuthin' but a she thing (Say it loud)
It ain't nuthin' but a she thing (On the rise)
It ain't nuthin' but a she thing (Better recognize)
Now I can bring home the bacon (yeah), fry it in the pan (yeah)
Never let you forget that you're a man
Cuz I'm a W-O-M-A-N
That's what I am, doin' all I can
The thing that makes me mad and crazy, upset
Got to break my neck just to get my respect
Go to work and get paid less than a man
When I'm doin' the same damn thing that he can
When I'm aggressive then I'm a bitch
When I got attitude you call me a witch
Treat me like a sex-object (That ain't smooth)
Underestimate the mind, oh yeah, you're a fool
Weaker sex, yeah, right, that's the joke (ha!)
Have you ever been in labor? I don't think so, nope
I'm a genuine feminine female thang
Can you hang? Ain't nothin' but a she thang

It ain't nothin' but a she thing (Say it loud)
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (On the rise)
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (You better recognize)
On the real I'm a female doin' what I feel
Put me to the test, yes, I will get ill
Sensitive and sweet, yeah, all that good stuff
But when it's time to get rough, baby, I'm rough enough
Ain't afraid to show how I feel down deep
Compassisionate but don't underestimate me
I'm intelligent, wise, complicated being
With an instinct to dream and believe in the dreams
Family's first before anybody else (believe that)
Take care of them before I take care of self
I'm a genuine feminine female thang
Can you hang? Ain't nothin' but a she thang
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (We are proud)
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (Say it loud)
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (On the rise)
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (You better recognize)
You got to understand it's a she thang
We got the power, yeah, you know the deal
So you go, girl (You go, girl!), it ain't no man's world
You can do anything (You can do anything), do what you feel
Excuse me, hold up...(Pep got the floor!)
I'm givin' props to the strong women layin' down the law
Taking control of the wrongs in their life (hey)
Standing up and turning all the wrongs to the right (ho)
I'd like to give a shout out to the mamas out there (Shout it out)
Bringing up the babies with the tender loving care
You're in charge of the future of the nation
Do the right thing, lay the foundation
To all the single mothers Salt-N-Pepa said, "Keep your head up"
I know it gets hard sometimes but never let up
You're a genuine feminine female thang
Can you hang? Ain't nothin' but a she thang

It ain't nothin' but a she thing (We are proud)
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (Say it loud)
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (On the rise)
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (You better recognize)
Now let me break it down to the marrow of the bone
I'm a female (go!), and I got it goin' on (ya know)
Don't be fooled by my S-E-X
It ain't that simple, I'm more complex
We've come a long way, and, baby, that's a fact
Let's keep moving forward, girls, never look back
Fight for your rights, stand up and be heard
You're just as good as any man, believe that, word
