Are you ready?

Pump, pump, let me see you jump, shake your rump
Push it real good, break it down with the funk
One love, like the LB say, right
Music makes us high
But you've been giving shade 'cause I stay paid
Sippin' lemonade, don't be mad 'cause I got it made
Diva-hatin', waitin' snake in the grass
Look me up and down when I pass with ya sneaky ass
Vibin' with your girlfriends
Jealous of my dividends and my Benz and my ends
Like no other, butter-smooth like cream
I keep it milky when I moves on the scene
Got you fiending, on lockdown, can't you tell?
Never fell, Black queens doing it well
We be the crew that you wanna step to
Sisters with an attitude (Uh), now how my mic sounds?

My mic sound nice (Check one, check two)
Everybody make way (Party people coming through)
Throw your hands up (Put 'em up), bounce (Hold steady)
Are you ready?
My mic sound nice (Check one, check two)

We make you burn with the hot track, spin and scratch the hot wax
So I could grab the microphone and climax
Bars stay lean and cream keep stacking
Dr. Suess cracking the beats with no slacking
So move with the groove, make your knees weaker
Salt-N-Pepa coming through your speaker
Hot blazing, so amazing
Hundred fifty proof raisin' the roof, who got the juice now?
Yeah, papa, I'ma break you off something proper
Show-stopper like Frankie Crocker
Female phenomenon when you get off, then put me on
Miss Jiggy, hell yeah, huh, the bomb diggy
Microphone check one, two
Brand new coming through, you know how we do
Stay on point like a needle, who are you to judge like Ito?
Recognize Salt-N-Pep's steelo

I'm 'bout to make the whole world bounce, make it freaky 'til you're drippin'
Salt-N-Peppa got me in the VI sippin'
On the dance floor, non-stop how we movin' in
Game so tight lubrication couldn't loosen it
B-L-A-Q the bomb, y'all know
Chi-Ca, Chi-Co who matching my flow?
Shake what your mama created until it hurt ya
Daddy came to freak it down and work ya, what time is it?

P to the E to the P to the A
Lay my game down precise like every day
Display many styles for years, I've been here
Iced-out sex appeal, I put your lights out
Pull your mics out, we rock the party
Freak your body, no need for a shotty
I'm gonna make you sweat all night, hold tight
All heads turn when I snatch the mic
Send the party into orbit
Coppin' drop tops 'cause I can afford it, ain't nothin'
Party over here, what you doing on the other side?
We came here to get live, take a ride
With the S and the P, hey, Pep MC
Shine every time just like the Lex be
You wanna test me, don't floss
We got the flow that'll break you off decent
Leave you locked like the precinct, how we get down?
Worldwide, everybody know about the sound
Let it pound in your system one time
All up in your mind how we shine? Genuine
