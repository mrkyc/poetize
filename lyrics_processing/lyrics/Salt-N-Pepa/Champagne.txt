Tight security, everywhere I go I take 'em
Party over here, (rah-rah) me and my peeps
Hittin' the streets groovin' to roughneck beats
I keeps the flow, I'm the dawnbreaker
I'm reachin' all night, as hot as daylight in Jamaica
A ruckus - you want it?  Get with the Showstopper
I'll dig ya like the mud number one chief rocker
But knock a blast for your ass like boom!
Damn, Salt-N-Pepa stepped in the room

Hot, cool and vicious, delicious, Jamaican
Big Willie, illy-silly rabbit
You need the ha-ha, you gotta have it, a habit
I'll be the goodtime dealer
The happy-go-lucky lucker, keepin' it real-a
Got the whole shebang, champagne is bubbly
Moneymakers lookin' and I like 'em black and ugly
