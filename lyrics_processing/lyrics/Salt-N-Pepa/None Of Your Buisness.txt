Why you gotta mess with mine?
Don't keep sweatin' what I do
Cuz I'm gunna be just fine
Check it out!
Chorus:
If I - Wanna take a guy
Home with me tonight
(It's none of your buisness.)
And if she - wanna be a freak and
Sell it on the week-end
(It's none of your buisness.)
Now you - Shoulden't be gettin' in to
Who im givin' skins to
(Its none of your buisness.)
So don't - Try to change my mind
I'll tell you one more time
(Its none of your buisness.)
/Chorus
Now who do you think you are?
Putting your cheap two cents in?
Don't you got nothin' to do than worry bout my friends?
Check it!
I can't do nothin' girl
Without somebody buggin'
I used to think it was me
But now I see it wasn't
They told me to change
And called me names
Then so I popped one
Opinions are like assholes
And everybody's got one
I never poke my nose in
Where Im not supposed ta'
Belive me if he's something that I want
Im steppin closah' (closer)
I'm not one for playing Hi-Po
Like a house o' ditty, nine o' two one o type of ho
I treat a man like he treats me
The diffrence between a hooker and ho
Ain't nothin' but a fee
So hold your tounge tightly
Wish you could be like me
You poppin all that mess
Only to stress and to spite me
But you can get with that
Or you can get with this
But I dont give a shit
Cuz really its none of your buisness
You might also like(1993, S and P, packin' and mackin'
Bamboozlin' and smackin' suckers with this track
Throw the beat back in!)
Chorus
How many rules am I to break before you understand
That your double standards don't mean shit to me
I know exactly what you say
When I turn and walk away
But thats okay
Cuz I dont let it get to me
Now every move I make
Somebodys Clockin'
So ask me nothin
Will you just leave me alone?
Nevermind who's the guy that I took home...
To bone
OK!
Miss thing never givin up skins
If you dont like him or his friends
What about that Beeenz?
Your Pep-Pep's got an ill rep
With all that macaroni trap for rap you better step
Or better yet get your head checked
Cuz I refuse to be played like a penny cent trick deck of cards
No, I ain't hard like the bitches on a boulivard
My face ain't scarred, and I don't dance in bars
You can call me a tramp if you want to
But I remember the punk who just humped and dumped you
Or you can front if you have to
But everybody gets horny just like you
So, yo, so, yo, ho - check it, double deck it on a record butt-naked
Pep's ass gets respect, and this butt is none of your business
CHORUS
So the moral of this story is
Who are you to judge?
Theres only one true judge
And thats God so chill and
Let my father do is job
Salt n papa swinging again
