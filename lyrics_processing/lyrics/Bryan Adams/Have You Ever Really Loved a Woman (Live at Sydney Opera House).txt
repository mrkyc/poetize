You gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought, see every dream
And give her wings, when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know, you really love a woman
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's the one
She needs somebody to tell her
That it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really, ever loved a woman, yeah
To really love a woman let her hold you
Till you know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her, really taste her
Till you can feel her in your blood
An' when you can see your unborn children in her eyes
You know, you really love a woman
