I'm looking for that perfect line
To let you know you're always on my mind
Yeah, this is love - and I've learned enough to know
I'm never letting go
No, no, no - won't let go
When you want it - when you need it
You'll always have the best of me
I can't help it - believe it
You'll always get the best of me
I may not always know what's right
But I know I want you here tonight
Gonna make this moment last for all your life
Oh this is love - and it really means so much
I can tell from every touch
No, no, no - can't get enough
When you want it - when you need it
You'll always have the best of me
I can't help it - I believe it
You'll always get the best of me, yeah
Best of me, oh
Oh this is love - and I've learned enough to know
I'm never letting go
No, no, no - won't let go
(You'll always get the best of me)
You'll always get the best of me (You've always got the best of me)
You'll always get the best of me (I can't help it)
You'll always get the best of me (I can't help it)
