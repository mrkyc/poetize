Yeah, yeah

Here I am, this is me
There's nowhere else on earth I'd rather be
Here I am, it's just me and you
Tonight we make our dreams come true

It's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of young hearts
It's a new day, it's a new plan
I've been waiting for you
Here I am (Yeah, yeah)
Here I am

Here we are, we've just begun
And after all this time, our time has come
Yeah, here we are, still goin' strong
Right here in the place where we belong

Oh, it's a new world, it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of young hearts
It's a new day, it's a new plan
I've been waiting for you
