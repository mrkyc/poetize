Clue number two was the look that you wore
An' that's when I knew it was a pretty good sign
That something was wrong up on cloud number nine
Well it's a long way up
And we won't come down tonight
Well it may be wrong
But baby it sure feels right
And the moon is out and the stars are bright
And whatever comes gonna be alright
'Cause tonight you will be mine
Up on cloud number nine
And there ain't no place that I'd rather be
And we can't go back but you're here with me
Yeah, the weather is really fine
Up on cloud number nine
Now he hurt you and you hurt me
And that wasn't the way it was supposed to be
So baby tonight let's leave the world behind
And spend some time up on cloud number nine
Well it's a long way up
And we won't come down tonight
Well it may be wrong
But baby it sure feels right
(All right)
