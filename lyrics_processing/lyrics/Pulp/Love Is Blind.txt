Give me the sea
Give to me everything I need
The future is shining
Like a giant metal beast
It shines so bright tonight
With its legs open wide
And love is blind
Falls in love with itself again
Like it never should
The way it always can
And she is mine
But the world is much bigger now
Oh, tell me, should I hold her hand
And give her love
Or take her heart and throw it far away?
Oh, now is the time to jump into it all
I'll just hold my nose and try not to fall
To seek and to find, instead of walking around
With eyes glued to the sky
I turn them down to the ground
Oh, and I used to think that maybe one day
I'd find the love of my life
Oh, but it's so far away, oh, I don't know why
Oh but I, I want it all tonight

We held hands
And we looked out of the bedroom window
We could see all the buildings collapsing around us, so we kissed
And we laid on the bed
And we waited for the ceiling to fall in
But it never did
In the morning it was all still there
The spilled milk and the dog-turd
In that grey ashtray morning light
I could hear thousands of people
And they were all singing this song
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
Hey, butcher!
Oh, oh, oh, hey, butcher!
What's your name?
Oh, hey, butcher, what's your game?
Oh, you take all their love
And you suck out their eyes
And then you rip out their hearts
And you eat their insides
Yeah, then you just walk away
With a smile on your face
Hey, butcher, hey, butcher
I've seen your face before
