Hey, oh, now the lonely nights begin
And there is nowhere left to go
But watch my spirit melt away
Down at the D-I-S-C-O
I must have died a thousand times
The next day, I was still alive
And I still believe in you
Yes, I do
Let's do it now

No, I was not crushed, I did not cry
You know that everything's O.K
It's just sometimes I wake at night
All alone and see your face
Oh, thousands feel the same
But the nighttime falls away
Oh no, but still sometimes I feel
Oh, sometimes I feel like Jesus Christ now

Hey, I feel this night will never end
And I will never see the day
Oh, I was nothing when you came
I'm no-one now you've gone away
Oh, all I do is just O.K
All of my nights and all of my days
Oh-oh, if you came home right now
I'd run away, I'd run away now

O.K. now
Alright
You can go out and make love to whoever
Or whatever you like, babe

So I go out and fill my eyes with other women
Oh, they look good to me and I think that I might kiss them
Oh, now it's two a.m. and I'm still stood here waiting
So I go home and wonder why I bothered going
Yeah, every week turns out the same
The sun, the wind, the snow, the rain
Oh no, but still sometimes I feel
Oh, sometimes I feel like Jesus Christ now

Hey, I feel this night will never end
And I will never see the day
Oh, I was nothing when you came
I'm no-one now you've gone away
Oh, all I do is just O.K
All of my nights, and all of my days
Oh-oh, if you came home right now
I'd run away
I can't believe it
I can't remember your face anymore
Or the sound of your voice, oh
Or any touch of your skin is a legend
By the way, did I tell you that I love you?
Oh, if I didn't, I'm so sorry
You know I, I really, I really meant to tell you
It's O.K., there's no need to hurry
But the bed is full of memories, full of memories of you
Oh, I tried to get them out but, but there's nothing I can do
Oh, if I knew the moon I'd ask him
Shine his light in through your window
And send your body home to me today, hey

Hey, I feel this night will never end
And I will never see the day
Oh, I was nothing when you came
I'm no-one now you've gone away
Oh, all I do is just O.K
All of my nights, and all of my days
Oh-oh, if you came home right now
I'd run away, run away
