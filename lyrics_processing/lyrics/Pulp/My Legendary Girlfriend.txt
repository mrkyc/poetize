And I know you're asleep
I can hear the soft sound of your breathing
So I get up and I go to the window
Outside, I can see all the houses
Curtains shut tight against the night
Asleep beneath the roof tiles
And as I stand there, I wonder
I wonder how many more times I'm gonna come here
I wonder how many more times I'm gonna lie here
And most of all, most of all I wonder, I wonder what it means
I just wanna know what it means
So I woke her and we went walking through the sleeping town
Down deserted streets, frozen gardens grey in the moonlight
Fences down to the canal creeping slowly past the cooling towers
Deserted factories, looking for an adventure
I wandered the streets calling your name
Jumping walls, hoping to see a light in the window
Let me in, let me come in, let me in tonight
Oh, I see you shivering in the garden
Silver goose-flesh in the moonlight
Oh, she's balancing
There are so many others with unbroken eyes
No cellulite afternoons
And she is balancing, balancing on the edge of ugliness tonight
She is balancing, good God

Oh no, she doesn't feel right, she's got no one to hold
Her love is a sham, he is dancing somewhere
Oh no, he doesn't care, oh well, he'll never know
Jump, touch my hair now
Come on, I don't care
'Cause tonight, maybe we could
Maybe we, maybe we can touch the sky
Do you think that we could?
Do you think that we can touch the sky, please?
I know, I know it's, it's not forever
But tonight I don't care
Your skin so pale in the moonlight (oh!)
And the way your lips swell up when you're asleep
Nothing else matters (oh!)
Do you know how much I want you?
Can you feel how much I want you?
Oh! Pitsmoor Woman
Oh, oh, let, oh, let me in tonight
My legendary girlfriend, she is crying tonight
Oh no, she doesn't feel right
She's got no one to hold
Her love is a sham, he is dancing somewhere
Oh no, he doesn't care
Oh well, he'll never know
And all the stars came out tonight
And the moon came on his face
It shone right though the clothes she wore
It shone right through the dress she wore
Good God
Oh, y'know
Oh, listen
Listen, please
Oh, I just wanna
I just wanna
You don't understand, oh
It's not like that anymore, please
Please, please, I just wanna
I just, I just wanna
He falls to sleep again
No ch-cheese tonight
She knows
My legendary girlfriend, she is crying tonight
Oh no, she doesn't feel right
She's got no-one to hold
Her love is a sham, he is dancing somewhere
Oh no, he doesn't care
Oh well, he'll never know
And all the stars came out tonight
And the moon came on his face
It shone right through the dress she wore
It shone right through the clothes she wore
And the stars and the moon
And the stars all came down today
Oh, please love me tonight
