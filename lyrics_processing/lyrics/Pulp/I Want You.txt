Hey, you can look
You can look just like anyone else
If that's what you want to do
I, I could laugh
I could laugh in your face if I want
Oh, but I'm not going to

When we met last week on Saturday
I couldn't make a sentence, I couldn't even say
What I meant to say

That I want you, it doesn't hurt to say I want you
I need you, I never thought I'd say I need you
I'll keep you, oh, yes, I'll keep you and I'll throw myself away
Away, away
And I'll break you, because I lose myself inside you
I'll make you fit in the space that I provide you
I'll take you, oh, yes, I'll take you just to push you far away
Away, away

Yes, yes, you're all
Yes, you're all that I ever desire
Still I'll kill you in the end
When, when it seems
When it seems that it's getting too soft
When you lapse into a friend

There's someone just behind the door
So don't betray your feelings, no, don't talk anymore
Never dare to say

That I want you, it doesn't hurt to say I want you
I need you, I never thought I'd say I need you
I'll keep you, oh, yes, I'll keep you and I'll throw myself away
Away, away
And I'll break you, because I lose myself inside you
I'll make you fit in the space that I provide you
I'll take you, oh yes, I'll take you just to push you far away
Away, away

Now, now we come
Now we come to the end of it all
See it squirming, almost dead
No, you can't leave
You can't leave it to die here in pain
You've got to stamp upon it's head

I'll go out and you'll stay home
Facing up to living, living on your own
And I'll curse my pride
Curse my pride
Curse my stupid pride
'Cause I want you, it doesn't hurt to say I want you
I need you, I never thought I'd say I need you
I'll keep you, oh, yes I'll keep you and I'll throw myself away
Away, away
And I'll break you, because I lose myself inside you
I'll make you fit in the space that I provide you
I'll take you, oh, yes, I'll take you just to push you far away
