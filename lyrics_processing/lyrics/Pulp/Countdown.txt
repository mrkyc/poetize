It started slowly, and I thought it was my heart
But then I realised, this time it was for real
There was no place to hide, I had to go out and feel
But there was time to kill, I walked my way around town
I tried to love the world, but the world just got me down
Oh so I looked for you in every street of every town
I wanted to see your face, I wanna, I wanna see you now
Yeah I wanna see you now
Oh and so it went, so it went for several years
I couldn't stand it, oh, it must be getting near
Oh no you just don't know, no you just don't understand
How many times I've seen you in the arms of some other man
I've got to meet you and find you and take you by the hand
My God, my God, you've got to understand that I was seventeen
I didn't know a thing at all
I've got no reason, no reason at all oh no
Time of my life, I think you came too soon
You came too soon baby
And it could be tonight, if I ever leave this room
I never leave this room
Oh, oh, oh, I wasted all my time on all those stupid things that only get me down
Get down
Oh and the sky is crying out tonight for me to leave this town
So, I'm gonna gonna go, really, bye bye

Because I own this town, I brought it to its knees

Can you hear it begging to me "Please?"
I know it's coming so soon now, it's on it's way
Oh no my God, my God, I can hear them say
They say it's all a lie, they say I'll never leave the ground
They say I can't survive, and it's coming down
