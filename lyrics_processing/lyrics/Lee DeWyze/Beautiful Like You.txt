Everybody wants to look into the mirror
And feel a little better now
And everybody wants to know there's someone out there
Waiting for you to come around

And I wish that you could feel it
But you don't choose to believe it
Cause I know that you can't see it that way, that way

If you could only just stop, stop, stop running
If you could only take a second to breathe it in
Everything that you know would be beautiful like you
You know they're never gonna stop, stop, stop your love
Let's pretend that the world is waking up
Everything that we see is beautiful like you
Like you

Everybody wants to tell someone their secrets
Why don't you tell me now?

Well, maybe I can fix this
Then I don't want you to miss this
And the sun is raining down, yeah
You might also like
If you could only just stop, stop, stop running
If you could only take a second to breathe it in
Everything that you know would be beautiful like you
You know they're never gonna stop, stop, stop your love
Let's pretend that the world is waking up
Everything that we see is beautiful like you

Sometimes it's hard to be yourself in this crazy world
Sometimes it's hard to breathe, yeah
Everybody wants to know there's someone out there
Waiting for you to come around, come around

If you could only just stop, stop, stop running
If you could only take a second to breathe it in
Everything that you know would be beautiful like you
You know they're never gonna stop, stop, stop your love
Let's pretend that the world is waking up
Everything that we see can be beautiful like you

Can be beautiful like you
Can be beautiful like you
