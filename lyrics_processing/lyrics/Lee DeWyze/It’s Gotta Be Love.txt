Having flashbacks since I get up off the carpet
And then I said, "Hold up, I think I remember
Over a couple of shots and an old jukebox I met her."
I said, "Call me crazy, but what am I to do?
I don't know your name, but I'll never get over you."
It's got to be love
I've never been so sure of this before
I know you think so
It's got to be love
'Cause everything is upside down and
My knees are weak, my heart skipped a beat
All because it's gotta be love
It's gotta be love, oh no no
I keep on lookin' over my shoulder
I swear I hear your voice, but no I'm just hungover
I keep searchin' through all of my pockets
Until I found your name and number I won't drop it
I say, "Call me crazy, but what am I to do?
I wonder if you feel the same, cause I'll never get over you."
It's got to be love
I've never been so sure of this before
I know you think so
It's got to be love
'Cause everything is upside down and
My knees are weak, my heart skipped a beat
All because it's gotta be love
You might also likeI used to laugh at this before
But when you're awondrous
It's so hard, you're lying on the floor
Love, love at first sight was so much more
And this heartache makes my headache
So easy to ignore
It's gotta be love
It's gotta be love, oh no no
Cause I'll never get over you
It's got to be love
I've never been so sure of this before
I know you think so
It's got to be love
Cause everything is upside down and
My knees are weak, my heart skipped a beat
All because it's gotta be love
It's gotta be love
It's gotta be love
It's gotta be love, oh no no
It's gotta be love
Cause it's gotta be love
It's gotta be love
It's gotta be love
It's gotta be love, oh no no
It's gotta be love
