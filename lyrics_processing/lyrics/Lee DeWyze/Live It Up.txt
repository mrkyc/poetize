It's kind of funny, got me wondering why
Maybe I'm just not your type
Or maybe I'm your Mr Right
I could your Romeo, you'll be my Juliet
Maybe I'm the one that you'll never forget
I know that I'm just passing through
But I might stay for you
You've only got one life
One life to live
I wanna give it everything I've got
Who knows? This might be it for us
So why don't we live it up?
Live it up darling
Give it up, my heart is starving
Live it up
Give it up
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to stare
You got me hypnotized with your long brown hair and your
Hazel eyes and your don't care smile
Would it be rude to ask if I could stay awhile?
I don't mean to intrude, I had to say hello
Because if I never did it then I would never know
I might just be passing through
But I might stay for you
