We fell asleep under the stars
And you woke up in my arms
And the rain and the rain and the rain
Was falling down trickled off our finger tips, oh oh

Felt like the earth stood still when I kissed your lips
I get chills chills chills just thinking about this
You were melting into me
And I was melting into you
It was the kind of moment that only time could kill
It was the perfect day, the day the earth stood still
The day the earth stood still

Another night goes by
Without you by my side
Oh, and I dream and I dream and I dream
That we're back, that we're back to where we were
Take me back to where we were

Felt like the earth stood still when I kissed your lips
I get chills, chills, chills, just thinking about this
You were melting into me (You were melting into me)
And I was melting into you (And I was melting into you)
It was the kind of moment that only time could kill
It was the perfect day, the day the earth stood still
You might also like
Do you ever think of me when you're lying there alone?
Do you know, do you know what I'm going through?
'Cause I can't seem to let it go, and I wonder if you know
If you know
That a part of me is still waiting for you

Felt like the earth stood still when I kissed your lips
I get chills, chills, chills, just thinking about this
You were melting into me (You were melting into me)
And I was melting into you (And I was melting into you)
It was the kind of moment that only time could kill
It was the perfect day, the day the earth stood still
