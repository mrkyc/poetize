Sweet serendipity
Oh, oh!

I don't got no car
And I got one pair of jeans
They've been stretched too far
Now they're weak at the seams
I can't say what's next
And I got nothing up my sleeve
But I don't lose my head
Cause it ain't really up to me

And I'm doing just fine
I'm always landing on my feet
In the nick of time
Something by the skin of my teeth
I ain't gonna stress
Cause the worst ain't happened yet
Somethings watching over me like sweet serendipity
Oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh!
Sweet serendipity
Oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh!
You might also like
I don't ask for a lot
Nothing more than I need
Cause I love what I got
Don't need to play no lottery
I just wanna be strong
Happy end of the road
I don't want to hold on
I want the strength to let go

And I'm doing just fine
I'm always landing on my feet
In the nick of time
Something by the skin of my teeth
I ain't gonna stress
Cause the worst ain't happened yet
Somethings watching over me like sweet serendipity
And what will be will be, in the nick of time
Something by the skin of my teeth
I ain't gonna stress
Cause the worst ain't happened yet
Somethings watching over me like Sweet Serendipity
Oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh!
Sweet serendipity
Oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh!
Now, sweet serendipity
Don't look fate can only find you
Can't choose for something to surprise you
Set sail without a destination
See where a wind will take you
You never know where you're gonna fall
But I'm not worried, no I'm not worried at all

And I'm doing just fine
I'm always landing on my feet
In the nick of time
By the skin of my teeth
I ain't gonna stress
Cause the worst ain't happened yet something's watching over me
And I'm doing just fine
I'm always landing on my feet
In the nick of time
Something by the skin of my teeth
I ain't gonna stress
Cause the worst ain't happened yet
Somethings watching over me like sweet serendipity
Oh, oh, oh oh oh, ohhhhhhh!
Sweet Serendipity
Oh, oh, oh oh oh, ohhhhhhh!
Fate can only find you
All something to surprise you
Set sail without a destination
Sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet
Sweet serendipity
Sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet
Sweet serendipity
I don't know
