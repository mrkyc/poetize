I uh, I just don't think I can order that
Well what do you want
I just want you to be happy

What you know about keeping it honest
What you know about falling in august
What you know about love when it's right
Have you ever had lonelier nights

The staying up wondering what broke you up
Tell yourself it's only up from here
But you ain't healing up
This feeling here sucks (sucks)
Like all I got is bad luck
Cuz I ain't ever had much
Ain't nothing really funny about it
But a funny story I recorded a couple different moments in the past (past)
I don't even really watch 'em that's just all I got left don't ask me shit
Wondering what you doing right this second, I don't really wanna fight this second
I remember those days, mind stuck in those days
I know you been struggling so I been steady on my hustle
We never gotta speak again but I prolly send you like a rock or two every week or two
That's a weak move I heard I know the nerve
This nigga wanna save hoes nigga stand tall nigga don't fall nigga fuck you that's my bitch
And she know that
You might also like
I'm her nigga I know it
I call she throw it
She call I flow it
I mean we good it's understood

We met we fuck we fell in love (yeah yeah)
We broke it off I broke you off (aw yeah)
We know wassup you know wassup (yeah, yeah)

Smoking more than I used to
Drinking more than I ever did
I'm just trynna squash the feelings
I dont wanna feel 'em I just wanna get work done
Woah while only getting older
Had to dip up out a floater
All these motherfuckers sleeping
Gotta put them on another couple folders
Nigga trynna soda pop
Pills used to kill these now I'm on Henny and I don't wanna stop ( I dont wanna stop)
Tell me what you know about hate (hate)
Tell me what you know about lost love
Tell me what you know about fate (fate)
Tell me why you always gotta talk tough
Posturing fostering ill will you ain't heal well
I get it things went south quick
And you wear that shit like a outfit
You don't ever let shit go (go)
Why you never let shit go
Why you always holding on to the bad times
Everybody got wrinkles (aye)
Funny how that shit played out (yeah)
That back and forth was played out
We gonna need a little time
In the mean time imma fade out
I'm her nigga I know it
I call she throw it
She call I flow it
I mean we good it's understood

We met we fuck we fell in love (yeah yeah)
We broke it off I broke you off (aw yeah)
We know wassup you know wassup (yeah, yeah)

I assume you have a whole new group of friends right?
You won't even think about this place anymore
