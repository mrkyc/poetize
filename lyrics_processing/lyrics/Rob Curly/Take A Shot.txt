Yeah..
I'm wit it,  throw it at me I'll hit it
All I do is take risks, I left safety back wit them fitteds
I got this far on my own
I got new chicks on my phone too
Payments for my clothes.. getting money for my shows too
Getting money for my folks too, getting money like I'm supposed too
I won't be tied down, get lost with that rope too
Like '02 in my front room and I'm like nine and I'm just fine
Mom's packing my lunchbox and I hope she threw in those gummies too.. and we good
Then fast forward like four years and I'm right here but I'm 13 and I'm writing like I never wrote
Youngin' wit a pipe dream, something like a miracle
Fast forward, nineteen, everything was good to go
Finally dropped my first tape, everything was memorable
Fast forward, 21, on the run, on my own, put it all.. in every song
Now it's like a song a day, I get it in
Eleven hit a million plays, go tell a friend
Man I hope that this don't ever end.. I play to win
(Chorus)
Life lackin' love.. take a shot
Life, live it up.. take a shot
Get a lil money.. take a shot
Take a fuckin' risk.. take a shot

Ain't no time for coulda, ain't no time for fights
Ain't no time for tries.. gotta get it right, feed my appetite
Outta sight (sight, sight).. they know I'm that guy
(Part2)
I don't wanna be the same, I just wanna change the game
Hit Eject, put that discs in flames, niggas actin' strange
Feelings change, people change, loyalty should never change
I need the stage, I need to rage, I need the fans, I need the pay
I'm tryna take it there, they just tell me keep it up
I'm just hoping Cali's in my future if I keep it up
I feel like I'm winning slow
I feel like it's creepin' up
Someone told me money talks
I can hear it speakin' up
Now I got the mindset of a nigga tryna get it
