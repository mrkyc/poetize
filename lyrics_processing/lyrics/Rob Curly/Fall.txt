ZYA:
Nothing lasts forever but I thought we could
Tried a little better but misunderstood
I shoulda known better but the high you give
Leaves me wanting more, really ? to live
Somethings gotta give
Gotta change how it is
Cuz I ain't feeling this... anymore
You're like my favorite drug
Know I'm afraid of love
I need a taste of ya
Just wanna try
I gotta place for us
Baby lets change it up
We can get high as fuck.. up to the sky
Yeah yeah
You're the only drug that I can't buy
Got me so high
You're like my favorite drug

You could be my flower.. I'm the nitrates
And I can't let you slip away.. you just my taste
And I done seen the wrong side of love so what's the right way
And I can't help but think things should go my way
Sandy shores, cool breeze and a light pour
Like Hen or, Remy or, any or
Fenty for you if you for me
Empty for you if you phony
If you feel me like you say you do then shorty show me

Plenty fish in the sea, yeah (true)
Wouldn't mind catching you, yeah (true)
I mean it's something to do (yeah)
