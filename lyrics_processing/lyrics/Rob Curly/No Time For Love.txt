Yeah.. Yeah
Fuck it then let's crack a toast
I been gettin' love like from coast to coast
I been gettin' love like from overseas
I can't even get it from the one I need.. nah
(Chorus)
Yeah..
She said I own it, I own it
You know how that shit go
I'm gon be gone by the mornin'
You know how that shit go
I don't got time for no love, I brought the drugs if you down for that shit
I just smoke weed, I'm just saying I got some for you
I don't judge if you down for that shit
(Part2)
You got that good shit, but you ain't got nothin' else
It don't make no sense why you act like somethin' else
Keying my whip nah you can't be my wifey
You act like you don't care but that isn't likely
Fuckin' wit you hella dicey
I roll the dice and I just pull a nike
People see me like a sight see, she still see me like a might be
I might be makin' some moves, she don't see I got the juice
She don't see I got the proof
She rather tear down the roof, I rather build in the booth
I got these women, I'm winnin' right?
I did 'em all, man I'm sinnin' right?
I don't want no new beginnings, right
I rather focus on livin' right
I got my fam and my city, right?
Miami nights wit the city lights
You might also like(Chorus)
Yeah..
She said I own it, I own it
You know how that shit go
I'm gon be gone by the mornin'
You know how that shit go
I don't got time for no love, I brought the drugs if you down for that shit
I just smoke weed, I'm just saying I got some for you
I don't judge if you down for that shit
(Part 3)
Pickin' up tabs cause I rap, Grabba the wrap
Roll up the bud like a cast, hand on a flask
Why I been drinkin', I don't even drink
Why you askin for a favor? we don't even speak
I feel better when I'm workin', I don't need the sleep
I ain't really goin' down unless it's Easter Pink, and we in sync
I'm the dreamer that you never see
I been scheming on the world since the infancy
Fuck defeat, all the haters burn in effigy
Rest in peace to the real and f'n G's
I would rather take the bread wit the extra cheese
Save the beef, Ima beast when you hit the beat
Gotta keep the circle small so it never leaks
Gotta keep a work of art in the other seat
A misses me, the kinda girl that gets the extra key
But who is she?
(Chorus)
Yeah..
She said I own it, I own it
You know how that shit go
I'm gon be gone by the mornin'
You know how that shit go
I don't got time for no love, I brought the drugs if you down for that shit
I just smoke weed, I'm just saying I got some for you
