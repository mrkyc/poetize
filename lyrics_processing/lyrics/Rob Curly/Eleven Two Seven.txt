Waking up, rolling up..
Shawty wanna zip it up.. she don't even smoke
Fuck in the morning and fuck in the evening, that's breakfast and dinner we feasting
No time for beginners, no time for actual eating
We working on bending and breathing
She put it down like the heaven's descending cause she know that Curly is only ascending
Gimme that real love
That Jada and that Will love
That let's get up that hill love
That pick up, like let's get out and kick it
Just be-cause, I don't trust, but it's all good
I probably could cause I used to but used to that "use you" mentality
Man that's fatality
Leeches be suckin' it outta me
Feel like they killin' my batteries
Bitches been bad to me, I took a battering
Fuck it I came back and I brought the Calvary
Look at this juice I got, look at these moves I make
Nigga I'm earning my stripes, nigga my legs don't shake
Man I need a steak in a fortune 500
I sold a verse for like only 500
I needed rent but I needed 900, so I told em drop it or nigga just run it
I hope that she see me get hot
I hope that she know that she not on my mind
I don't got time for the thoughts (thots)
I prefer classier box so thanks for ya time

Bitch get buck like bottles on bottles
You been the one from the get so it's like fuck all the models
Man you been trippin', don't trip
You better fuck wit Moscato, cause I'm that nigga that nigga I just might fuck all the models
Babygirl don't sleep, babygirl I'm beast, babygirl get yo ass out the streets
Don't you really wanna be somebody, don't you really wanna do something bout it
Man you gotta be you to the core, like feet to the floor, like head  to the sky
If it feel like a chore, let it go.. let it muhfuckin' go, never interfere wit the flow..
Bitch get buck like bottles on bottles
You been the one from the get so it's like fuck all the models
Man you been trippin', don't trip
You better fuck wit Moscato, cause I'm that nigga that nigga I just might fuck all the models
Babygirl don't sleep
(Part 2)
I got options, I'm poppin'
We takin' shots like a Thompson
I wanna take em till I'm feelin' something and they wanna take em till they feelin' nothing
Both of us running, jumping, tryna make something from nothing
Nothing is nothing, and we too young for this, we took a L for this, did a lot of shit, went through hell for this
And I stand by all that
All I know is ima fall back
You hang up but then you call back
All I know is that it's all bad
That's my que I gotta get gone
I got girls that's tryna get flown
I know girls that's tryna come home
You that girl I'm tryna move home..
(Chorus)
Bitch get buck like bottles on bottles
You been the one from the get so it's like fuck all the models
Man you been trippin', don't trip
You better fuck wit Moscato, cause I'm that nigga that nigga I just might fuck all the models
Babygirl don't sleep, babygirl I'm beast, babygirl get yo ass out the streets
Don't you really wanna be somebody, don't you really wanna do something bout it
Man you gotta be you to the core, like feet to the floor, like head  to the sky
