Once you cross the line there's no return
There's so much at stake
Promises are given and forgotten
The Day will come the one who betrayed you
Will be begging for loyalty

I don't turn on my own
Keep ridin till the wheels fall off
I don't turn on my own
Keep ridin till the wheels fall off
I don't turn on my own
Keep ridin till the wheels fall off
I don't turn on my own
Keep ridin till the wheels fall off
I don't turn on my own
Keep ridin till the wheels fall off
I don't turn on my own
Keep ridin till the wheels fall off
I don't turn on my own
Keep ridin till the wheels fall off

Imma hold the whole team down
Don't you know I charge fees now
I ain't got the same keys now
I don't smoke the same trees now
Buzz Up my feet now
I ain't wit the home team now, I am the whole team now I feel so good
(This is paradise, relax)
I've been dreaming of a hundred million
Makin music tryna make a killing
I been rolling in the moment
Think i'm losing touch with touching on my feelings
Bitch i'm in the building
Money takes the place of love never get enough I don't want enough
Only thing I trust
Money makes the world go round

I don't turn on my own
Keep ridin till the wheels fall off
I don't turn on my own
Keep ridin till the wheels fall off
I don't turn on my own
Keep ridin till the wheels fall off
I don't turn on my own
Keep ridin till the wheels fall off
I don't turn on my own
Keep ridin till the wheels fall off
I don't turn on my own
Keep ridin till the wheels fall off
I don't turn on my own
Loyalty cannot be given like a charity
