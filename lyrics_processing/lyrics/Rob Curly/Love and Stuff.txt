It's like when someone makes your stomach feel all tight
But floaty at the same time ya know
And your cheeks hurt from smiling
And you smile so much that people think something's wrong with you
Love is light
Acceptance
Wish them feelings came sooner girl hallelujah girl
Shoulda never let you go should've never let you go (go)
Henny made it much smoother girl hallelujah girl
Shoulda never let you go shoulda never let you go
I wish I still knew you girl hallelujah girl
I shoulda never let you go
Wish these feelings came sooner girl hallelujah girl
Shoulda never let you go shoulda never let you go (go)
Henny made it much smoother girl hallelujah girl

Gotta live inside the moment
If you fuck up you should own it
I could prolly sign a sony
All my homies been some soldiers
Officer you gotta quota
Please don't give me that baloney
I am not your fucking homie
You should really get a tony
Everybody gettin older everybody gettin colder
Ain't no trust in whatcha doing if they can't see whatcha doin
I been so persistent I been so consistent
Working like I got my own assistant
Workin like it's like a competition
Shoot my shot up from the fucking trenches
Seem like women always superstitious
She just wanna know your horoscope
Fucking with you girl I know you know
Nolia clap before you throw it back girl
Fire nani shawty Gwen Stefani
Oh my god you got me better holla back girl
Dip and dabble never dribble (yeah)
Lately i've been tryna travel (yeah)
Gotta let go let god really gotta pick your battles
Love you girl i'm glad to (yeah)
Bitches always been a hassle
Love the way you in your books girl you look better with a tassel
I've been poppin I got hella options I could quarter back it but i'm all yours
Love is nothing like I thought it would be
