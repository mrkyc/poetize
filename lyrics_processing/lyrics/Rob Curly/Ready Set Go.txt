Yeah..
I need mami
Aw, she keep it sloppy
Got the head, got the brain
Aw, she got the body
Hit the split on the..
Right right right, she origami
Pop a sci-fi, crack a 45
Take a shot like a 45 till the floors fly, gettin' more high
Get the buzzin', here come the hunnies
Get some money, up pops the bunnies
Drop the fakes and flip kick the hoes and stick wit the chick who sticked thru the lows
I'm the chauffeur, the soldier, the man and the crying shoulder
Cuffed a couple chicks, but I'm comin' up on my quota
Used to cop alot, now I cop alot
Nothing changed but the parkin' spot, got a newer spot
Tryna come up on some bigger things, something gotta change
I ain't talking bout a wedding ring, I just need a ting
Everybody tryna club out, I just wanna drink.. Ima drink
(Chorus)
Chill.. drink
Roll.. smoke
Ready set go, baby let go and let goat
You should let a real one get close
We could just
Chill.. drink
Roll.. smoke
Ready set go, baby let go and let goat
You should let a real one get close

What's a dollar to a dream?
I remember when I used to want a limousine
I remember when I used to want to have the bling
Everything was c.r.e.a.m, it was all about the scene
Rappers wit the lean made it cooler than it was
Living on the edge, even better wit the drugs
Doobie like a crutch, middle finger to the fuzz
Probably had some lust, probably thought it was the love
Never so, forever never lasts, never goes
Further than it should when you tying down a soul
Everybody gettin' bored quick, up and forfeit
I been tryna make a fortune, fuck a Ford Fit
I would rather push a Cool Whip till the tour hits
Man I'm tryna see the whole world, not the same shit
Can't nobody tell me that I gotta watch my language
Ima speak French in France
Ima take a couple bands out to Amsterdam
Ima take a couple dames and my homies too
Ima let em see the thangs that me homies do
Fuck the rules, never ever really fucked wit those
Yeah I say fuck alot, fuck the status quo
Ya never know when they wanna see you fall or fly
It's very rare that we ever seeing eye to eye
I'm hella fly
(Chorus)
Chill.. drink
Roll.. smoke
Ready set go, baby let go and let goat
You should let a real one get close
We could just
Chill.. drink
Roll.. smoke
Ready set go, baby let go and let goat
