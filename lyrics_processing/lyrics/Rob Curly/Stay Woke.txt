Who  got the loud? Who got that punch in the chest, hmm?
I'm knockin' it down. We ain't even had lunch, yet
We ain't even, even. She been scheming. I been getting money, she been seekin' semen
You a hoe for cheatin'. I'm a G for leaving
Bless up, I'm Morgan Freeman
Checks up for my tracklist
Ima never stop and that's in the cement
Hatin' hoes on my blacklist
Niggas weird and you wouldn't believe it
Gotta keep a distance, never need permission
Nigga, risk it all. Nigga, stay persistent
Never need a assistance, nigga fuck the system
This the new resistance, they gonna be physicians
We some 90's babies, do it so efficient
Labels wack, I'm into independent
Bandwagon my intuition
Lil cash never changed the vision
No revisions, no indecision. It's all precision like short division
Shorty do long leg division. Shorty do think that she different
Hippy shit, she a flower child
Going hit for hit like we volatile
Hit the blunt like a left hook. Inhaling like all the while

Leave 'em lone and never come around
They always come around

Nigga I'm cold, get a coat
Fuck all these niggas, I put up a moat
Nigga I'm GOAT, niggas be doin the most

Damn it I'm here with my woes, ducking and dodging the trolls
Changing my area code
Hoes in different zips codes
Man it's so Ludacris how she get low
Man I think that I'm losing it, she gotta go
Gimme the go, niggas will settle for less, nigga I'm going for Gold
Shawty been drippin' in gold, she play her role
She act like got some sense in a sense, act like she still got some real innocence
I cannot sense it, just light up and light up the incense
I got the inches, the riches, the wrenches
They good for the ratchets, not good for the bitches
They good for the mattress, no good for the misses
I know
