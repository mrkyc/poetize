They gon' smile in your face, all these niggas fake
Plottin on your bitch when you look away
Scheming ass niggas, all bitchmade niggas
Circle get smaller, gotta renovate nigga
I'm just tryna get the work like im running late nigga
Money, power and respect, that's the only way nigga
Say, word
They gon' smile in your face, all these niggas fake
Plottin on your bitch when you look away
Scheming ass niggas, all bitchmade niggas
Cirlcle get smaller, gotta renovate nigga

Stab me in my back, then they say "wassup?"
Schemin ass niggas i could never trust
Thought you was a homie, but you never was
I peep game, then i do adjust
Homie plottin on my ex, like i dont know it
Never trippin off of shit, cuz I'm so (?)
Prolly felt some type of way, but I'll never show it
I'll never save a hoe again, bitch I'm not heroic
Man these niggas not my niggas, that's a damn shame
Had to drop the dead weight, pop the champagne
Never trippin off a bitch, keep it (?)
Gotta keep my circle tight if imma maintain
Miss me with the small talk, niggas don't respect you when you all talk
Always had a grip, i never fall off
Never roll a spliff without the (?) dawg
I just want it all dawg, million dollar deals in my car lot
This is just a prologue, i ain't even start yet
Couple million plays, i ain't even hit the chart yet
Money just a side effect, gimme all the glory, too
Haters come with any win, fake friends switchin, too
Wrist, wrist, nigga, wrist wrist, get your wrists slit
Off with your head (be)fore you talk shit
Niggas lie, true, bitches lie, too
Prolly find your enemies right beside you, tryna sleight you

They gon smile in your face, all these niggas fake
Plottin on your bitch when you look away
Scheming ass niggas, all bitchmade niggas
Circle get smaller, gotta renovate nigga
I'm just tryna get to work like I'm running late nigga
Money, power, and respect that's the only way nigga
Say, word
They gon smile in your face, all these niggas fake

Only take a L if it's to the face
Only let it out when I'm over base
Really, i was taught a man never shook in plain
Separate from the fakes, only real remain
Rather fall way back, than to bitch and moan
Real homies always got you with the pick and roll
I ain't tryna take it easy, we got different goals
Certain niggas act a bitch, we got different roles

They gon smile in your face, all these niggas fake
