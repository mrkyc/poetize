Three bad years on a good day. Six good years on a bad day
Should of known from the get that the bitch was
A bitch I mean I did what never made me part ways
Funny how the heart plays
Tricks on the mind
And what if we could just rewind
Have you holding grasping on a hope
You ain't even seen the time fly by
You ain't even see the vision why I try
Everything I hope would happen never really
Happened ended moving backwards ended with some backwards
Now I'm about my cheers cheese cheese
Packers moving like a trapper
Fit up on me dabber
Fucking different bitches just to break the pattern
Focus
Move the money
Money
All that matters
Funny how the woman make the money matter
All my home town hoes in a challenge
But they never about it tell they check your balance
Tell you pour that good liquor up in there chalice
All I see is fake bitches
Call them callus
Messing hoes and ballast
All them bitches valid
Hooker with a side
A guy to keep a balance
A guy to keep my good girls at a balance

Yo
Had to leave state for a peace of mind
Told everyone that rent was signed
Had to lie, had to dip
I hate the way she made me flip
Ya, Ya
But now I got some fucking distance
Now I'm like a linings, now I'm back to business
Now I spend my time and money on the visions
Used to waste it on the bitches
Now I'm on my solo golo
Don't got the time or patients for the gemecks
Trust my intuition, Fuck my inhibitions
Me and you together
Baby just forget it
Ain't no time for love love love
Cause you don't even know the meaning
And I ain't trying to get to know no body else
Nobody else can get me cheese
And like you where the money
Imma chase the money
Ain't a thang better for me than the hundreds
Could of been us and a million bucks
Funny how it worked out
Who you trust
Who you supposed to trust
When you can't trust the one you supposed to love
