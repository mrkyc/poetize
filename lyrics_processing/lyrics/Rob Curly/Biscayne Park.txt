Things ain't been the same ever since
Shawty was my flipping other half like a twin
Mrs. always gotta tell the story with a spin
Mrs. stab you right up in you're back with a grin
She was, something else heard of nothing else
Always think of somebody else, don't know herself
I always tried to do right by her
Had the best intentions and I still got tired
Man we seen a lot
Always used to cop
Used to love to fuck, usually on the spot
Never thought we'd hit that wall
Never thought I really would regret that Fall
Man I, really did give that my all
And now I, really can't sweat that off
I been thinking way too much
I think I'm going to need that blunt

Getting higher cause I'm tired of the lows now
Miss my teenage years watching Roll Bounce
Funny funny funny how it played out
Shorty really got one on the way now
Swear that really had me feeling way down
Guess that really means she's out the way now
Fuck it man I'm really on my way now
All my old hoes text me 'hey' now
You might also likeThings ain't been the same ever since
I been on my own in a sense
I'd rather be alone in a Benz
So lately I been swinging for the fence

Could've been the one, guess not
Can't help but feel that we both missed out
It's fucking over yeah I still trip out
Heart still missing probably got ripped out
I remember good times too
Used to think I did get through
Used to know it all I thought
Didn't get the picture like that shit got cropped
But you can put that blame on me
And I'mma wash it down with that Henn and tree
See I done learned a lot since then
It's probably best if we don't speak

Getting higher cause I'm tired of the lows now
Miss my teenage years watching Roll Bounce
Funny funny funny how it played out
Shorty really got one on the way now
Swear that really had me feeling way down
Guess that really means she's out the way now
Fuck it man I'm really on my way now
All my old hoes text me 'hey' now
Things ain't been the same ever since
I been on my own in a sense
I'd rather be alone in a Benz
