It started with a hook up and shit
I remember when we pulled up and rolled up and shit
Give me the light
Give me the love
Give me the truth
Give me the music
Give me the mic
Give me the booth
Keep the alphabet
Give me the U
I give to you
Give me the dub and them legs too
Do what it do
Give me the truth, never the lie
Never the snitch, never the fall
Never the flip, never the roll
Baby got my back and got back
Running trough my mind, so I'm thinking on track
You never know shit you never know
Gotta speak your mind
Ask the questions or the answer's no
Every single time
You booty, but your attitude really sucks
Maybe you should get a lamp or two
Lighten up
See you're movin' on quicker than me
Im chasin' the money, you chasin' the meat
Shade shawty, I playin' for keeps
I wanna be fucking, you wanna meet peeps
Fuck that, I'm lookin' to fuck that
Give me the go
Give me the talk slow, give me the talk flow
Give me go
I never met a girl like you
And I don't think I'm gonna find another like you
My shooter and future
Miss Medusa, I thought that they knew
You're my personal nudist
I'm rubbin' your belly like Buddhist
My boo
I love you when you hold me down
I hope you never let me go
I know we had our ups and downs
I hope I never see you go
I know you need some time to yourself
But you never gotta be alone
So call me if you need my help
And you never gotta cry alone
I've been here from the get
Wearin' my heart on my sleeve where it fits
Keep my babe by my side
Makin' her whole milk and cha fly
You my sexual shaman, never been to good for ramen, nah
You the fault in our stars, you the one with my heart
You might also like(Hook)
I'm livin' every day like this
Hopin' that the next brings a few more checks
I wish
I could sum with you but you don't wanna son
