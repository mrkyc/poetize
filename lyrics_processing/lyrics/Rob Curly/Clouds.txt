I see you way up in the clouds
And can't no nobody can't nobody shoot you down
I see you way up in the clouds
And can't no nobody can't nobody shoot you down
I see you way up in the clouds
And can't no nobody can't nobody shoot you down
I see you way up in the clouds
And can't no nobody can't nobody shoot you down

I got a rifle, a pistol, I'm shootin', I missed you
I miss you, the old you, the old me that dissed you
He's gone, really gone, really moving on
You really got a new nigga? Really told your mom
That you're done with me, you're over me you'd rather be
Under me
Simply you're feeling me, gotta be, hopefully
Maybe so, maybe no, maybe not, baby no
Overload with arguin' and askin' you "who car you in?"
Arguments on arguments, barterin' and bargainin'
Trying to get your heart again and maybe we can start again
Part of him and part me
Probably a part of me
Left with you and F's with you
Kinda like it F's with me
And all the things we'll never be and all the things we'll never do And we just gotta carry on and act like this is
Right
But it's not right, you left in a breath and I'm left
With what's left

I see you way up in the clouds
And can't no nobody can't nobody shoot you down
I see you way up in the clouds
And can't no nobody can't nobody shoot you down
I see you way up in the clouds
And can't no nobody can't nobody shoot you down
I see you way up in the clouds
And can't no nobody can't nobody shoot you down

I see you way up in the clouds
So I can shoot you down

Am I invited to your cloud 9 way up in the sky?
When I ride by, should I stop by to just say, "Hi"
Or stay a while, play a while, kiss you up, make you smile
Make you miss me when I leave
Miss the way I breathe
DVDs and a dub, cuddle up
But that song that's in the works
Man I never really trust
I never had a handle on that shit you callin' love
She a dove from above
But her wings had enough
That's enough
We said we'd never try to give up
And I ain't never try, so she went and gave up
And I don't know a thing that could even save us
Went from love into lust then to dust
Cut
I see you way up in the clouds
And can't no nobody can't nobody shoot you down (never)
I see you way up in the clouds
And can't no nobody can't nobody shoot you down (never)
I see you way up in the clouds
And can't no nobody can't nobody shoot you down (never)
I see you way up in the clouds
