I cut on kehlani, surely she shortly tsunami
She got the body I prolly went kamikaze
I won't be kissing and telling, I keep my shit on the low
I got a chick straight from spellman i'm giving dick on the low
She got a nigga who graduated I just play my roll
But she say he got some bitches so she dont feel like a hoe
I got a woman from HoustonAtlanta that's not a typo
We almost had us a junior but that's a story that I know
I got a girlie a cutie, she got the eyes and the booty
It's like as soon as she met me she really felt that she knew me
Yeah she just chose up I froze up I usually choose when we choosen
I just live in the moment I don't get caught up on movie moments
You own it you own it
She say my name when she moaning
If i'm not wit her, beside her, she don't wake up in the morning
Momma im zoning im on it, i'm doing numbers you know it
I hit a million it's crazy I hope I never get older
Im fucking young and i'm happy you cannot disrupt my vibe
Shorty get lower get lower you cannot disrupt my high
It's like you only be focused on how I could do you better
But it's whatever I could never stick around for forever

This was supposed to be about us
But everything we do is bout you
I never knew a thing about trust
But I knew everything about you
This was supposed to be about us
But everything we do is bout you
I never knew a thing about trust
But I knew everything about you
This was supposed to be about us
But everything we do is bout you
I never knew a thing about trust
But I knew everything about you

You can't envision a future when you still stuck in the past
Bringing up all this shit when you act like you wasn't mad
You knew I had a type so you made some changes to fit it
Then you gon blame me for changes you made when you lost the feeling
How you act after a breakup to me is very revealing
Like how you with different people saying y'all only be chilling
See you got me stressin but you know time is revealing
So don't come checking for checks when all those checks start appearing
I got drive and i'm steering, I'm on the road to success
Baby I like what i'm hearing i'm even close to impressed
You've been working, a  hostess, I know you want your respect
But you been doing the mostest I like you better undressed
I like my life better solo I don't respond to the texts
I got the mind of a mogul...I don't succumb to the stress
It's a couple of no gos I don't respond to my ex
The only time that I slow up is if it's money or sex (yeah)

This was supposed to be about us
But everything we do is bout you
I never knew a thing about trust
But I knew everything about you

In the morning
Momma im zoning im moaning i'm doing numbers you know it
