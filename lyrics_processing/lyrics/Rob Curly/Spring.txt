In your dreams...)
She say she love me how I love her too
I can't fathom getting back with you
We got history that's old news
I can't stop thinking about youuuu
Youuuu
Don't get me started
I was kind hearted
Till this bitch broke my heart and turned me to a artist
I mean I was a artist but that was inspiration
When I tango with the mic it's like a conversation
I mean the back and forth is effortless
And shawty she a snack, little lower where the beverage is
We be in the poor mans double R, smoking and fucking off
Then nodding off, then waking up, then pouring up, then nodding off
And that's all nice and so good
But I treat that like backwoods
I rather not but I would
But that don't mean that I should
I got time to blow
I can't waste my nights
I got fire flows
These beats catch alight
I can't find your soul
Guess that's not for me, I got options now
They all hot for me.. and you ain't the only one

I can't fathom getting back with you
We got history that's old news
I can't stop thinking about youuuu
Youuuu
Yeah
You did me dirty, no repercussions
Like all for nothing, like now it's all or nothing
Like I'ma get this money, snap about it, tweet about it
Act like I don't know you bitches
You lack ambition
I bet I find you where I last left you
That's a premonition
But I ain't hating baby God bless you
It's always sunny in my little bubble
Left the liq, now it's wine with bubbles
She know she finer than a mother
Got her ass from her mother
And I smash on the gas when that ass call me over
And I know she trouble
But I'm still at her crib like on the double
I'm talking Barney Rubble
That mean I'm coming through, rocks on me
I got a rock for you if you down to rock with me
We could just talk or maybe exchange top
Cause mama you got shit these bitches just can't top
So shorty just do you and bet you they just watch
She say she love me how I love her too
I can't fathom getting back with you
We got history that's old news
I can't stop thinking about youuuu
