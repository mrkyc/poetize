Got a message from Vince
Said he still down to smoke, but he still with his chick
I told him i ain't really trying to make the trip with no bitch
She told him give him a sec, he think his girl got a friend
I ain't really to bout it until he hit me with the pic
I can't really believe it, Im thinkin fuck it i'm in
So i pull up i'm pushin' the teggy slammed to the floor
Mrs. benevolent lookin' better than gold
She got eyes like the earth, i swear she colder than cold
She said her momma a nurse, she said she hate being home
She said she just wanna live, she love the laughter and jokes
She said she love how im chill then she pass me the smoke
I said i think of the past and then i wonder bout space
She smiled bigger than big
She said she think bout the same
This girl is doper than dope, i'm tryin' to give her my name
She said that she gotta go, i'm sorry its getting late
I take her back to the crib, she tell me I can come in
Now im thinkin', i'm thinkin, i'm thinkin this might be it
So I follow her in, we end up sleeping till dawn
I tried to sneak out the back but I get caught by her mom
She tell me nigga come back, boy I just wanna talk
What's your name, what's your age, you see the time on the clock?
I think i'm caught, but then she leave and tell me to stay for the food
She said she bout' to get breakfast, she don't want to be rude
Now i'm, shocked, In a state of shock
Later shorty told me that her momma think i'm hot
Cute, probably said cute
She like the way I talk, she like the way I move
True, we been in the groove
Two weeks straight, everyday seeing you
We was in the bed, she hopped up on my lap
Covers on her head, voice about to crack
Will you, Will you Will you, always have my back
Will you hold me down, never hold me back
Crazy how it went, summer was the shit, she used to roll the blunts, smoke it in my whip
Momma never knew, right outside the crib
Then we go inside, red eyes and a grin
She used to chef it up, when everything was up
When everything went down, i was in the dumps
Made a couple songs, tried to make it up
Thought I'd give it time, I ain't wanna fuck it up
Worse than it was, started losing trust
Started losing faith, started gaining buzz
Figured I would make, at least a couple mil
Get my baby back, show her something real
I was thinking trips all across the globe
Bags full of money, money we could blow
Always had to struggle, always living broke
I was thinking we could pack our shit and go
I was thinking Europe, maybe stop in Rome
I was thinking yachts, I was thinking gold
Never thought I'd see, the day that she was gone for good
Checked her IG and peeped the ultrasound
Hoped it was her friend's or someone else around
Crazy cause I knew I shoulda put it down
Crazy cause I knew that shoulda been my child
Man it is what it is
Crazy how a life could bring it all to an end
But that's life
