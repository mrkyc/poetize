Let's get real life ain't fair but the time don't stop when the struggle gets real
Time don't stop
Time don't feel never hit pause don't slow me down I'm chasing the torch I know I got what it takes I hope you still trying to grow

I know that nothing is fake I know that work is awake I know some things you deserve I wanna blow you away

I know that you down for me down, down with me fucking around with me lovers and friends girl we pound and we pound burn us a pound just the two of us tell me if you got objections to doing it we had the dreamiest team girl I swear they not booing us happier couples are happy we doing this that's nothing new to us get to the root of us laughing and cussing a lot hashing and passing the pot smoking a lot you got the minds from medusa I know that you did I hope that they pass to our kids

Let's get real life ain't fair but the time don't stop when the struggle gets real
Time don't stop
Time don't feel never hit pause don't slow me down I'm chasing the torch I know I got what it takes I know I still gotta grow

I think that mama needs a car and karma's calling I got time on my hands and I ain't rushing I ain't stalling but I'm trying to get this moving make this music get influenced I got no time for games I'm trying to make my life a movie
 x2

Maybe it's time and maybe someone isn't trying you've just been crying and I'm just annoyed call me that asshole like I'm just a boy and this ship isn't buoyant and this bitch is too gorgeous and we just been burning these trees like a forest I need California shout out to keeping it loyal shout out to keeping it Royal shout out to getting the green building it up from the soil straight from the soil

Let's get real life ain't fair but time don't stop when the struggle gets real
