I heard the silk road is still a go
I know an old friend that's on the pole
And she winning so I can't trip
I got her number but that ain't shit
Man I'm trying to get a better view
Out my Honda to a better coupe
So I rap on and rap on
Put on and put songs in iPods and iPhones
Let the bygones be bygones
I palm the python to wipe off the icons
Picture me balling
Nikon and Spalding
Leaving and Falling
It's sounding like Autumn
I think that I got all my things
I'm packed and I'm ready
I'm walking to leave
I'm not in my right mind
I don't got a sightline
To reason critical thinking at all
Feelings involved

Love is a four letter word
And a verb and a noun and a girl in the crowd
Does it hurt tell me now
You might also like
Yeah it hurt with the curls and the smiles
Curves to the ground with a mind in the clouds
Yeah it hurt with the curls and the smiles
Curves to the ground with a mind in the clouds
Yeah you
Yeah you
Yeah you
Yeah
You

Woke up with the lights on
Must have been a dream
Felt like the real thing
Nothing like a fling
I'm all in
I'm falling
I fell in
A felon
She bad right
In that light
In this light
In no light
She never has to never have
A lot of things she's never had
Passion at a rapper
And the rafters of the rapture
Backdoors to main floors to billboards and after
Live long and live free
Rejoice and laughter
Relax and capture
Moments of bliss and events that you'll miss
Instance of real love and none ever since
Lost all my real trust and none ever since
She pray for a miracle
Been a nun ever since
It's simple math
Simple sense
Simple tasks
Simpleton
Love hard
Or not at all
Yeah it hurt with the curls and the smiles
Curves to the ground with a mind in the clouds
Yeah it hurt with the curls and the smiles
Curves to the ground with a mind in the clouds
Yeah you
Yeah you
Yeah you
Yeah
