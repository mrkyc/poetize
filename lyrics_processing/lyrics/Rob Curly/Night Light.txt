I never met a girl like you
Roll a joint so tight, keep it tight like you
Keep it up you the right type, uh
Keep me up like a night light, uh
That's a late night joint if you burn too
If I tell you what I want, watchu gon' do?
Are you down for me now, are you down?
Are you down for me now?

Yeah I found you, I found you
Lost in the beauty around you
You make my heart get to racing
Bye-bye them patience
I need you right now, I'm pacin'
Bring your ass over and light up this ganja
Bet that you pause when you see all these commas
Why you be frontin'? I'm cool with your momma
All of my time equals all of your problems
Seems like we fall and you leap like it's hot
Boo-boom-boomin' my heart, sparks, explosion
Reach in my chest but I think that it's stolen
I know who the thief is, that booty is golden
I know that the head is, her mind is so open
I pushed her away, now I'm left in the open
Feel like I need her, I pray for emotion
I feel like it's hopeless, I go through the motions
Emotions just fuck up and distort my focus
I notice that women live and breath emotion
The ultimate standoff, I know that you know this
I hope that you good, wish you all of the dopest
You might also like
I hope that everything's alright, I hope that everything's all good
I hope that everything's alright, I hope that everything's all good

I never met a girl like you
Roll a joint so tight, keep it tight like you
Keep it up you the right type, uh
Keep me up like a night light, uh
That's a late night joint if you burn too
If I tell you what I want, watchu gon' do?
Are you down for me now, are you down?
Are you down for me now?

I done rolled a lot, stressed a lot, and smoked a lot
Misses cop, cuffin' niggas like she never learned to stop
Guilty as charged to the sergeant
Baby you lose all your drive when you park it
Treating this love like a blunt, spark it up, pass it up to the one that you trust
Imma tell you like I told my mama; Imma get rich quick, it won't be no drama
I got that passion you cannot afford with a fortune
And fortunately Imma a force with the flow, see
Live by the lip like a goatee, takin' a hit pass, passin' it to the homies
Smokin' on mary and muchin' on Tony's
You smoke, if I smoke that's real if you know me I gotchu
Losing my mind when I'm finally beside you
You got that shit, got me losing my shit

I never met a girl like you
Roll a joint so tight, keep it tight like you
Keep it up you the right type, uh
Keep me up like a night light, uh
That's a late night joint if you burn too
If I tell you what I want, watchu gon' do?
Are you down for me now, are you down?
Are you down for me now?
I never met, I never met a girl like you
Roll a joint so tight, keep it tight like you
Keep it up you the right type, uh
Keep me up like a night light, uh
That's a late night joint if you burn too
If I tell you what I want, watchu gon' do?
Are you down for me now, are you down?
