Green eyes
Nice smile
Thick Thighs but a nice size
And I can't front it's the back side that got me hypnotized
Like baby you ain't gotta do a damn thing but talk to me nice
Walk to me right
Turn around and let me see you
Let me see what's underneath and let me get you right
I'm tryna get a hundred million dollars just so we could do it right
Flights in and out of state
Picking up the pace
Spending like it ain't, coming out the bank
Anything for you, my God
You should know it by now
You can't lose if I got you on my side
I'ma hold you down
Anytime I see you, I lose myself
I feel like we seen too much to still lose touch
I hope I know you when I'm older and you older
What if I told ya to come over
What if I handed the keys to the rover to you
What you down for?
You should come 'round more
The money just drizzle now but later a downpour
Cause I been at work putting work in the days and the nights
All this time in.. I put my price up
It's all in the timing.. don't waste my time up
Cause I need it just right and I ain't in no rush
You might also likeI feel like I'm trippin'
Like all this ambition and I'm chasing bitches
They not in the vision and that's not the vision
I need the millions like fuck all these feelings and fuck all these ceilings and fuck all that I think we should build shit
Cause I thin we should kill this
Im a romantic but a realist
I know better cause I done seen it go way better
And I was hoping we could grow better
But I don't think you a go-getter
Girl you expect a lot
Bet you be hedging your bets a lot
Hoping that somebody save you
And I ain't gon' save you
But I feel like we seen too much to still lose touch
I hope I know you when I'm older and you older
What if I told ya to come over
What if I handed the keys to the rover to you
What you down for?
You should come 'round more
The money just drizzle now but later a downpour
Cause I been at work putting work in the days and the nights
All this time in.. I put my price up
It's all in the timing.. don't waste my time up
