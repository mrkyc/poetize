You're all I need now, if you knew
I can't operate without you
No, I could never live another day
Falling to the floor, you're my heart attack
How far out have I got to move?
Oh, I've gotta get next to you
But you're so far away
Searching for a heart another world away
You're all I need now, if you knew
I can't operate without you
No, I could never live another day
Falling to the floor, you're my heart attack (heart attack)
How far out have I got to move?

I seen you shopping
Whole foods to be exact
I didn't stop you, old news to be exact
But now i'm thinking girl I made a mistake
Cuz you was like an angel I could barely relate
I seen your instagram you been taking flights
Now you fucking with the nigga that's been in your likes
Now you giving chances to these niggas riding bikes
Thinking that you really doing something for your life
Girl who been here for fights with your mom, fights on the lawn
Fights in the car, fights with the cops, fights with your pops
Picture this me n you minus them that's a crop
I remember me and you in the whip tryna cop
Hit the streets in my little beast prolly hit the beach
Pack a piece keep the windows up we can't even breath
Used to love that you loved to smoke (coughing)
You was like a pro with that honor roll we was on a roll
I ain't never plan to let you go (nah)
Then I had to let you go addicted to that alcohol
Wonder why you never call (wonder why you never call)
Wonder if it's for the best wonder if you were the best

How far out have I got to move?
Oh, I've gotta get next to you

If we meet again I got a million and a baby for ya
Been a minute since we had to end it
Gotta wonder how you feel about a new beginning
Fuck it we should meet again do it all different
Everytime I said I love you girl you know I meant it
I ain't never been the one to try to fake a feeling (nah)
I ain't never fall in love but I think Im in it
Trip on never fall girl it's been a minute (been a minute)
Prolly even fell girl I must admit it
Girl you coulda been the one if you saw the vision
I ain't really got the time girl i'm on a mission you been hella distant
Tryna walk girl i'm limping every song im singing i'm simping I hate it
Gotta get back on my pimping and chasing my paper
Gotta get back on my solo save women for later
Music my now and my later
I want the cover of Fader
I want a fucking ferrari
I want the crib on the beach
I want the one with the body I think it's time we should speak
Why you trippin girl we made for eachother
Yeah I should've made u a mother
Yeah I said it and I meant that
