I've seen this before, I can't let you go
It's been months since we both been alone, who you bringin' home?
I get jealous, you get jealous too, fuck them dudes you knew
I been tryna cut you out my life, I can't get it right
You been trippin', but that body's gold.. I can't let you go
I been sippin' on that liquid gold, I can't let you go
(Part A)
I been in the deep end, I been drownin' alot.. I feel like I been losing my mind
Every weekend she been drinkin' alot, I feel like I been wasting my time
Tokin', I been smokin' alot.. I feel like I been takin' my time
Everything coulda been perfect, I know that it's been like a cirus
You know that we got us a purpose, them feelings you hide..
Nobody's perfect and nobody's you
You just been lurkin', I already knew
(Part2)
Shot of the liquid courage, I know that you comin' thru
I could date a million girls, but I rather get drunk wit you
I been had my mind set, you know that I fuck wit you
You been on my mind.. yeah, I think I could run wit you
You been like my pot of gold, and I can't find that rain-bow
I tell you I gotta go, I told you to let go, let go, let go
