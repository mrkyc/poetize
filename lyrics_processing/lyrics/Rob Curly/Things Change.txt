Feeling like damn
Feeling let go
Feeling like ghosts
Feeling like both
Feeling like I can't find the reason
And I can't find the pieces
And I don't wanna leave it
Ain't nobody cheating
What I gotta do to make you believe it?
I wouldn't lie to you
Girl that's a try to me
Why you gotta lie to me?
Acting like you trust me
You don't really trust me.. you just wanna vibe with me
Fuck around and ride with me
Fuck around and die with me
Not a either or, not a even pour
I can't say forever.. I'm not even sure
I just take it day by day
Most these bitches pay to play
I ain't come to save the day
And you ain't never need a thing
Type of chick that need a ring
Type of chick that be a cane
Hold me up and I'ma hold you down
Yeah fuck the sevens.. I'ma cop the pound for ya
Show me something, I'ma stick around for ya
And ya walls... I'ma knock 'em down for ya
Switch the sound for ya
Just hold me down

Feeling like I can't find the reason
And I can't stop the grieving
And I can't stop you leaving
Not what you needed.. I can't believe it
I need a blunt rolled
Grabba leaf with the loud pack
Raw paper like Kinkos
Lost love where you found that
I been looking for you with the lights out
All these feelings gotta write down
Can't speak out
Introverted, not assertive
So concerned with how to word it
You don't even know the burden
Whole time you been hurting
Need ya trust but gotta earn it
I be quick to go and burn it
I don't wait to see the verdict
Please forgive me girl I'm learning
Just for you, don't ever worry
Got forever, ain't no hurry
All I see is you.. my vision blurry
You the one but it's still early
I'm still earning, still burning, still sipping like I'm still hurting
But I'm onto something else... onto something better
You my only help... you my one Coretta
Mamacita, you could hold the heater
Mrs. Everything and everything is even
Yeah
But I guess things change
Things change.. things change
Feeling like woah
Feeling like damn
Feeling let go
Feeling like ghosts
