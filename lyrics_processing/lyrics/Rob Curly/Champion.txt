Yeah
Hook it up
Booking agents hit me up
I been working, I been grinding, headline it, book it up
Doing numbers off of numbers, that's Eleven, look it up
What's the beef? If I don't hit you back, I'm cooking up
I like to lock in, get high like Lockheed
That's LaFerrari, I roll up, that mean that loudy
Like blowing four rings, that mean a Audi
Oh no allow me, to introduce myself
I'm the reaper to the beats and nothing else
I throw like no shade, stay low like low fades
That mean I can't stay low forever 'less it's no fame and lose all the plays
I feel like I'm chosen
I feel like some Henny or maybe some Vodka and soda
I'm usually sober
Maybe like never but sippin' like I got another liver
Eating real good like another dinner
You another sinner
Flowing like it's like a cold winter
It's a cold world (Cole World) and I'm just living like it's Dreamville
I just went and bought a white Range
I be renting out the Beem still
And I be tryna do the right thing but my loyalty is with the team still
What's the big deal? Don't trip.. it's no use
I been living off of Pro Tools since '15, that's old news and that's the bold truth
I was twenty two, tryna get it on my own two
Really feeling like I'm Goku, like nigga tell me what I can't do
I'm the same dude since '92, solid ever since the first week
Ever since I was an idea, wasn't even born till '93
Nigga Mother Earth said "lucky me"
To keep it real, I need her under me
I don't need her as enemy, she know everything
But I don't remember what she said to me
Yeah, smoking don't do the same things now do it?
Drinking don't do the same thing's now do it?
Niggas getting older now, time to get to it
Dripped all this water now I need fluids
Ima get to it, flowing like the sewage
That's a "I'm the shit" line
You ain't really made a track unless they run it back atleast two times
Still trapping off Groupon
Bread solid like croutons, put a suit on
Cuz what we smoking real serious
Loud as hell you gon' hear it
V8 with the supercharger let loose you probably can't steer it
And failure comes around every once in a while but you can't fear it, it's never that serious
I hope this Cuban bread come with coffee
And I hope this Cuban girl ain't just off me
Cuz she just want all of my heart
But I can't really let it up off me
It's a pattern, I got it mapped
First I reel them in close then I fall back
Then it's all bad, then everybody's hurt
Why I always do them dirty? Man I feel like dirt
That shit's egregious but please believe me
I'm fucking with you now, I know looks deceiving
I'ma hit you back more often and take you out
Take a shot then fuck it out
Bout to take the heaters out
Nigga short the seven, hit his brain until it's hanging out
Niggas got the bread but it's more about the principle
Crazy how these niggas really sell they soul
Don't you need it when you die if you tryna roam
I don't know but that's not a chance that ima take
And I ain't thirsty for the fame so I'm doing great
If I could pay my bills and rap then life's good
Give me space to do my thing like Mike Good
Niggas that I used to know getting salty now
It ain't my fault that you can't rap
Why you on my page, why you watching now?
Acting like a bitch nigga, fall back
I mean what type of nigga say they got cancer
Just so that they favorite artist might answer
Fucking goofy
And grimey moves is where you lose me
Cuz real niggas got they word, you just a fucking nuisance
So get the fuck from 'round me
Lame niggas stunk it up, I had to leave the county
I had to lead the pack
But certain niggas crave clout, they don't know how to act
They don't know how to move
In a room full of winners when you born to lose
You fucking loser
But off of that
You got me out my character, I love the fact
That everything been looking up cuz I ain't looking back
And the lion don't lose sleep over sheep nigga
Stay where you at
