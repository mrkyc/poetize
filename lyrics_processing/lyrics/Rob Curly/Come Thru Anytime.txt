All my old tings gone
Things went wrong
All them walls came down it all came down
I didn't really have time for ya I was blind for ya
Workin double fucking time for ya
Money always went faster then it came
I ain't really have a dime for ya
We was in and out on and off
Outta bounds and outta talks
Shawty always let it off spraying in the crowd and all
This chick never missed a beat
She asked me can you even speak
I think it's better if we don't
I know some people I should meet
I gotta go and chase some dreams get to them bigger better things
We always see in magazines I can't keep chillin like a teen
I been right here since 17
Since then I came a long way
But still it's still the same place this city get smaller everyday
You know i'm picking up the pace I need a million in the safe
A hundred million back at Chase I need some money in the bank
