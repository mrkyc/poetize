The live truth

All along I've ignored what I've always known
That the chair I've been sittin' on is a throne
Affection kneels at the seat of my soul

Swear to life, it can't get no better, oh no
By the way, I've been meanin' to thank ya (Thank ya)

One love, one love, one love, one love

I was lookin' for knowledge to sing my song
But now I know that I am wisdom on my own

Tell the truth, it can't get no better (Better)
Swear to life, it can't get no better, oh no
By the way, I've been meanin' to thank ya (Thank ya)
