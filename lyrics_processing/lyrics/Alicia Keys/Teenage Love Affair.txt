Uh, can't wait to get home
Baby, dial your number
Can you pick up the phone?
'Cause I wanna holla
Daydreaming 'bout you all day in school, can't concentrate
Wanna have your voice in my ear
'Til mama come and says it's too late

'Cause the lights are on outside
Wish there was somewhere to hide
'Cause I just don't want to say goodbye
'Cause you are my baby, baby

Nothing really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair

Another secret meeting
On the fifth floor stair case
I'm gonna give you this letter
Of all the things I can't say
Want you to be my first, my last, my ending and beginning, yeah
I wrote your name in my book
Your last name, my first
I'm your Mrs
You might also like
'Cause the lights are on outside
Wish there was somewhere to hide
I just don't want to say goodbye
'Cause you are my baby, baby

Nothing really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair

Hey, boy
You know I really like being with you, right?
Just hanging out is fun

So maybe we can go to first base
Because I feel you
Second base
Want you to feel me too
Third base
Better pump the breaks
Well baby, slow down
I gotta go home now
'Cause the lights are on outside (Outside)
Wish there was somewhere to hide (To hide)
'Cause I just don't want to say goodbye
'Cause you are my baby, baby

Nothing really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair
My baby, baby
Nothing really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
