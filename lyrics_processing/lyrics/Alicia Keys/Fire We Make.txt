I wanna burn a candle
Turn the darkness to light

With the fire we make
It's getting hotter and hotter
Like a moth to a flame

Stay away

It's getting higher and higher
Like the night to the day
I can't stay, I can't stay away

This abyss of the world and it takes us to the stars
It's getting higher and higher
It's the fire we make (It's the fire we make)
Getting sweeter and sweeter
Like a night to a day (About to make up these flames)
