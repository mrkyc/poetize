What up, what up, what up, what up? Yeah
Eve, let's do it again, hahahaha

Yeah, it's The Ghost, Jada and Eve
I'll squeeze my shit, I don't wave it and leave
Y'all motherfuckin' extra lame, here's the game
When I shoot, see if your man can catch your brain
I'm like De Niro when he drove the taxi, in the hallway
Shootin' niggas down if they clothes is tacky
Get it eighteen a brick and my clothes is khaki
And the Porsche got a glass roof
The blunt got a lot of purple haze in it, little bit of hash too
See me when I pass through, fuck around, blast you
Do what I have to, tryin' to get my math too
I'll leave a message in a phone I use
I coma niggas, bat 'em down, they bones I bruise
I leave fifty niggas dead, niggas know my rules
Another twenty more injured, niggas know my tools
I got a gun you need to stand for, fuck you bring your man for?

SP the ghost, double-R, what?
First come the hawk, then next be the toast
J to the mwah, double-R, what?
Send mad cowards on they way to Allah
E-V-E, double-R, what?
First lady, I just point, they squeeze
Ride or die, double-R, what?
Better keep your hammer right by your side
You might also like
I gave you the best flows
On top of that, I even made niggas set goals
I wanna know, how many bullets can your flesh hold?
Thirty-two or whatever the TEC holds, my dirty crew would
Rather hawk you to death rather than talk you to death
'Cause listenin' is like livin', when you talkin', it's death
So y'all better start readin' before y'all start bleedin'
And the odds was against us until we got even
Niggas in the hood don't give a fuck if you rich
I'm drunk with a Prince CD on, bumpin' the "Kiss"
Nigga frontin', get to you with the pump, it's kinda hot
I hit the button, put the roof in the trunk, play the block
With the royal blue .45, it'll make your mouth leak
Can't fuck with NY, get my diesel from South Beach
You ain't got a ride, get you a cab
Y'all bitches is mad, Eve got the shit in a smash, uh

SP the ghost, double-R, what?
First come the hawk, then next be the toast
J to the mwah, double-R, what?
Send mad cowards on they way to Allah
E-V-E, double-R, what?
First lady, I just point, they squeeze
Ride or die, double-R, what?
Better keep your hammer right by your side
I'm a savage bitch, ain't nobody gettin' close to this
And ain't nobody flipped and wrote this shit
And can't nobody sit and coach this shit, you feelin' lucky?
Then approach me, shit, I'm like the glass, you just a coaster
Bitch, under me, you wanna make it ugly?
Can't do nothin' 'bout her, angry that the public lovin' me
Rat bitch, pot bitch, hungover hot bitch
Wantin' all that money, fuck it, gettin' into rock, shit
Scared of who? Huh, we goin' get rid of you
Climbin' up the walls with gimmicks, that shit is pitiful
Dawgs close by me, so why try me?
They wanna copy, but they too sloppy
Damn, I got you stuck in a box, you feelin' trapped
Got your stomach in knots 'cause I ain't lettin' go
I'm keepin' it locked, I know you mad 'cause your luck's up
Plus I'm a purebred, baby, I don't fuck with mutts, come on

SP the ghost, double-R, what?
First come the hawk, then next be the toast
J to the mwah, double-R, what?
Send mad cowards on they way to Allah
E-V-E, double-R, what?
First lady, I just point, they squeeze
Ride or die, double-R, what?
