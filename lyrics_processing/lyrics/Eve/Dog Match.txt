Ah-ah
Uh (Oh)
Uh (Grr), woo
Uh (Grr)
Uh (Arf), uh (Arf), uh (Arf, arf)

Now for every real dog, there's that bitch that's behind him
That bitch that when that nigga get to missin', she gon' find him
Old girl gon' stand with the dog, hand in hand with the dog
And whatever the fuck went down, she ran with the dog
First time I had a match and didn't scratch, you catch?
Just loss half you niggas, but the pups'll fetch
And I know my baby girl is gon' stretch
Any rappin' motherfucker, male or female, place your bets
You can imagine what the bloodline is like
Since I love mine to fight, I'm on some shit like, "What time tonight?"
Y'all niggas can't be for real, 'cause any one of you faggots
Will catch a face full of lead, bitch, I'm still on you faggots
Fuckin' maggots wish you had it as good as I got it
I know my hands is in my pockets, but Eve got you spotted
Red dotted, evening before the dark (Uh-huh)
Grr, nothin' but a walk in the park

Always been the type of bitch that could roll with a thug and wipe up the blood
Roll in the mud with your other ducks, nigga, what?
What you need when the chips is down
Alibi on the stand when evidence is found
I'll give pound to your niggas, they respect this bitch
I spit rounds at your enemy, no less than six
Always keep the extra clip, dog taught me well
The extra eyes on your team, I see who's next to fail
Always hold your back up, I pick it up when you slack up
And if the tension gets too close, I tell the world to back up
Bind too tight, rhymes hoo-ride
Bitch in your litter, nigga, lessons through life (Uh)
Fuckin' with the dog, he's the master
Plus, he gon' show me how to blast you, bullets hit you then pass you
Split you then stash you, the game is real
E-V-E and DMX, nigga, the name's is real, uh

Fuckin' with the dog, man, niggas keep beefin'
Eve'll hold it down now, niggas ain't believin' (Woo)
Quick as niggas come in, quick as they'll be leavin' (Uh)

Fuckin' with the dog, man, niggas keep beefin'
Eve'll hold it down now, niggas ain't believin' (Woo)
Quick as niggas come in, quick as they'll be leavin' (Uh)

Get 'em girl, haha, that's my baby
I'ma put the bitch down 'cause the boy got rabies
All my pups is crazy, 'cause off the leash
They can eat, stand a match for three hours at least
And if the beast is in the big one, the beast is in the little ones
Talkin' 'bout, "Let's hit him, son," fuckin' with the little guns
Y'all niggas had a little run, what more do you want?
For your fans, you can front, but the dog is on the hunt

You know I'm at the door, voice box, rippin' 'em out
And you the only one can tame me when I'm flippin' 'em out
Bite's lethal, no recovering, I spits no other than acid
Up against the top contenders, none of them lasted
This bitch gon' always hold you down, keep the cowards thinking twice
I keeps it gritty, nigga, never think the love is light
Turnin' my back is something cats would do, I never take flight
'Cause any breed he puts me up against, this bitch is gonna bite
Fuckin' with the dog, man, niggas keep beefin'
Eve'll hold it down now, niggas ain't believin' (Woo)
Quick as niggas come in, quick as they'll be leavin' (Uh)
Paramedics on your chest, pushin' and breathin' (Woo)
Fuckin' with the dog, man, niggas keep beefin'
