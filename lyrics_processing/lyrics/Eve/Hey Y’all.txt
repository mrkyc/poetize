Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
E-V-E, E-V-E, E-V-E
And you know, you better know

I keep some Chuck's on my feet, khakis on my legs
Trunk full of funk, nigga while I'm breaking bread
Sliding through your system, banging, bobbing heads
Doin' mines and I don't care what other niggas saying
They can pop it, but they can't stop it, boy I'm gettin' mine
Selling clothes up in this bitch like Calvin Klein
Getting cuties to shake they booty at the same time
I'd be damned If I go back to jail for the same crime
I'm too slick to get caught up in this dirty game
I'm a scholar that make dollas off the birdy game
Crip hoppin' I got it popping on the boulevard
Man, I ain't fucking with Chevys, I got my own car
D-O Double you don't wanna rumble, why you testing me
Oh I know, you must be gone off that ecstacy
Bad habits you better kick it before it get you low
And try to get yourself hooked on this chronic smoke
Fo' sho

Hey yo, dogs from East to West Coast
All my dogs we could smoke
We 'bout to take some bank roll
Everywhere that I go
Man I see the same hoes
I know they already know
Yea, we like it real raw
Snoop, E-V-E, and Nate Dogg
You might also like
(Uh-huh)
These niggas got ya head noddin'
And this chick got the drums from your ear throbbin'
Known to do it, baby bubblin' don't you dare stop it
Love when bitches hate
You hear the song, pimp, it ain't nothing to me
Got my nigga Snoop, we been down
As for my nigga Nate, shit, he was in town
Created heat, so you can bang it, crank it nice and loud
Can't block me out I'm popping up
E-V-E, I'm up on your TV
Ain't never stuck up off the prissiness
Same bitch, same pitch, nothing ridiculous
Want this brown girl, I see you, thug, lick your lips
Gotta have that bombshell
Damn girl, I need you for me
Keep love on the both sides
We in the church on these niggas getting smoke ties
Domino playing, up here praying that they legalize
But fuck it, still choke, top down
Baby blowing smoke in the sky, come on

Hey yo, dogs from East to West Coast
All my dogs we could smoke
We 'bout to take some bank roll
Everywhere that I go
Man I see the same hoes
I know they already know
Yea, we like it real raw
Snoop, E-V-E, and Nate Dogg
Now, when you see me acting up in the club (it ain't nothin)
Uh, six fall up on dub's (it ain't nothin)
Huh, breaking up blueberry buds (it ain't nothing)
And every hood showing nothing but love (it ain't nothing)
Taste buds ain't the same, for the simple brain
Shoulda never let me learn what millions really mean
Yea I'm a simple girl, but really don't want simple things
Keep real dogs close, hate cats with simple brains
Not ready for the collision, stay up in your lane
East Coast, West Coast, you still don't fuckin think
Dedicated to you baby, keep your gangsta lean

You gots to be my queen, cause I'm the big king
The one with the big house with the big things
Sista Eve, you blessed the whole scene
You're the queen of the team, with cream, you're so supreme
A blessin in the skies, open up your eyes
Me and you together shit, we gone collect the vibes
Exercise, and go where we wanna go, stay fly
Sharp and original, turn up your stereo
'Cause here we go, here we go

Hey yo, dogs from East to West Coast
All my dogs we could smoke
We 'bout to take some bank roll
Everywhere that I go
Man I see the same hoes
I know they already know
Yea, we like it real raw
Snoop, E-V-E, and Nate Dogg
It ain't nothing
It ain't nothing
It ain't nothing
