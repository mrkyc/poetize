Ugh (Come on, uh)
Uh-huh (Flame on, uh, come on, uh)
Uh-uh-uh-uh (Flame on, uh, come on, uh)
Yo, yo (Uh, uh)

Let's talk about who I am
Blondie, find me in the hood with my peoples
Love y'all, hate the rest of y'all that I can see through
Above that, I can't feel nothin' 'less it's lethal
Testin' your moves, never that, make your position fetal, uh

I wanna talk about Dog nigga, L-O-X, Eve, and me
Now that's the hottest thing in the streets, our beats is Swizz
Cheesed up with holes in the shit, Double R roll thick
And ain't nothin' sweet but Drag-Eve tracks honey roasted
Burn it 'til it's been around now, how the fuck that sound?

Yo, let's talk about
Platinum plaques, hangin' on my wall
See me decorated, she's the one
Heard 'em say it, see me celebrated
I pop shit when it's necessary, not for nothin'
I use clips for them big beefs
See me bustin'? Blaow!
You might also like
I wanna talk about bitches I fucked
I'm a dog so I can't stand no bitch that hounds
I'm far from a clown
If I'm not knockin' her down, Drag's probably not around
So I'm not one to claim by either one of you dames
If y'all catch Drag with a mane, trust me she got my last name
Here's the hook, uh

Now Drag-on will show ya niggas how we lock this shit
Now Eve gonna show y'all niggas how we rock these hits
Now we gonna show y'all niggas how we pop this Cris'
Drag (E) dash (V) on (E)
Now Drag-on will show ya niggas how we lock this shit
Now Eve gonna show y'all niggas how we rock these hits
Now we gonna show y'all niggas how we pop this Cris'
Drag (E) dash (V) on (E)

Let's talk about little dick niggas
Always talkin' 'bout what you got
Rather be finger-popped
Dick probably the size of a bough stuffed with rocks
Fuck the cop, nigga, go shoot pool, pussy plot
You make me cum, I might flood the block, wet on my socks
Uh, I wanna talk about guns niggas don't bust
Y'all need to see me if y'all wanna see shells pop out
I make niggas say, "Watch out," when I got my Glock out
Niggas clock out, 'cause I run up in your watch house
Snatch up all your rocks out
Then throw your box out
Ya motherfuckers better watch out

Hold up, yo, let's talk about fake ass bitches
Lyin' on yourself, you ain't ready for the world, mama
Beggin' every second money hungry, life drama
Get your own stacks
Why you think these niggas pussy hungry?
'Cause you actin' triflin'
Layin' up, takin' his money, uh

I wanna talk about live or die, fuckin' with I
Niggas will fry like stripped bacon
I leave them shakin', keep 'em sizzlin'
Fuckin' with them, you might win
But they only got six shots with a barrel that spin
And us, our clip is spinnin'
And hittin' all their men
Yo, I wanna talk about ride or die
My dogs control confrontation in any situation
Five niggas on your team
Five niggas you replacin'
Five niggas used to gleam
Five niggas left with nathan
But their game that we took
And now they back to chase it

I wanna talk about bitin' ass niggas
Let me see y'all niggas catch the flow
Go red-vest with the four-four blow
Ya niggas gonna hit the ground for sure
Nigga, let me know if you want more
If he catch you with a pound to choke, you know
Nigga never die slow, 'til his eyes closed
Then jump on the highway, I go
Man, fuck the po-po, them niggas is movin' slow mo, come on
Here's the hook, uh

Now Drag-on will show ya niggas how we lock this shit
Now Eve gonna show y'all niggas how we rock these hits
Now we gonna show y'all niggas how we pop this Cris'
Drag (E) dash (V) on (E)
Now Drag-on will show ya niggas how we lock this shit
Now Eve gonna show y'all niggas how we rock these hits
Now we gonna show y'all niggas how we pop this Cris'
