Come on, huh
Come on, yo, yo, yo

Some people blond peeps, red banjies
Some are moving quickly, outta town
How they gonna find her moving swiftly?
Five steps ahead of the best so that's nothing
20 steps ahead of the rest, they left stuck
And in they face not, what not?
I can't stand broads
Ridiculous niggas practice for the title "hard"
Me pick of the litter, I was born to bubble y'all
Born to change game shit, born to stand guard
Play games you left nameless, fame hard
Promise that it's never painless, nigga be hard
Convinced that you can take over the Eve, eat nigga let starve
Strong as a stallion maiden, you better dart
Is she feminine with pretty women friends all dimes?
Timberlands is how I like my men and all minds
Rough Ryde, you niggas hard head, soft spine
Pass the word, must have the stacks to cross lines, come on

Don't want your dough
I don't want your car (Uh-uh)
Don't want your jewels
No, not at all (Nope)
With them other broads
You might rule it all (Uh-huh)
But not with me
Sorry boo, I got it all (Come on)
Don't want your dough
I don't want your car
Don't want your jewels
No, not at all (Yeah right)
With them other broads
You might rule it all
But not with me
Sorry boo, I got it all
You might also like
Yo a chick is a chick, a nut is a nut
And they always keep an attitude 'til you butter 'em up
Since I ain't gotta buy you stuff, who gon' hold you down
If they try to run in here and tie you up?
Now don't start flippin' it, everybody know
We've been had dough, y'all just start gettin' it
Money might make you grown
But you still need a dog to take you home and make you moan
You ain't gotta see the bank for loans
All I do is party and bullshit like when Frank was home
And you got it all boo, I got it all too
A four, five, and a six and they all blue
And I don't care what she think
If I offered you any ice, love, it'll be in the drink
And instead of talking 'bout what you got and all that
Just make sure when I hit you that you call back
Come on, uh-huh

Don't want your dough (Uh-huh)
I don't want your car (Yes, you do)
Don't want your jewels
No, not at all (Stop lying)
With them other broads
You might rule it all (Rule it all with you too)
But not with me (Come on)
Sorry boo, I got it all
Don't want your dough
I don't want your car (Uh-huh, yeah right)
Don't want your jewels
No, not at all (Yeah right)
With them other broads
You might rule it all (Rule it all with you too)
But not with me
Sorry boo, I got it all
Yo, yo ayo
One touch will make a nigga blush on sight
Grown men create a crush, nails they bite
It's a game try to catch me but only if you can
It takes a lot to impress the bombshell to want a man
And it ain't about your dough, baby, Eve alright
'Cause if Eve wanna fly away, Eve take a flight
Eve hungry for a meal, baby, Eve get a bite
You nice and you might get to see it daddy, tight

Yo, yo, yo
I'm glad that you got it all, that's more for me
And I ain't gotta pay for the puss, I score for free
And the same thing I pulled on them, I pulled on you
Come on now, how you think I pulled your crew?
Got my own crib so you can't kick me out
I'll call one of your friends to come twist me out
If you know Jada then you know what Kiss be 'bout
Just for fun, I hit the bank and pull 50 out, uh ah

Don't want your dough (Uh-huh)
I don't want your car (Yes, you do)
Don't want your jewels
No, not at all (Stop lying)
With them other broads
You might rule it all (Rule it all with you too)
But not with me (Come on)
Sorry boo, I got it all
Don't want your dough
I don't want your car (Uh-huh, yeah right)
Don't want your jewels
No, not at all (Yeah right)
With them other broads
You might rule it all (Rule it all with you too)
But not with me
Sorry boo, I got it all (Come on)
Don't want your dough (Uh-huh)
I don't want your car (Yes, you do)
Don't want your jewels
No, not at all (Nope)
With them other broads
You might rule it all (Uh-huh)
But not with me
Sorry boo, I got it all (Come on)
Yeah (Uh-huh)
Yeah right (Uh-huh, come on)
Uh (Uh-huh)
Stop lying! (Uh-huh)
