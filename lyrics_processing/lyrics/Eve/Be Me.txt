I'm just tryna be me, to be me

One, 'cause I really wanna see the world
Two, always knew I was a super girl
Three, staying laced in diamonds and pearls (To be me)
That's the way you gotta treat a girl

Uh yo
When I was broke, cats was like do that
Now that I got something, cats is like screw that
They wish I could've blew that
Back with them complaining
Spazzing, stressed out, not maintaining
I move on, speak shit so far from so long
You the one that made me go forth and go on
Blew up, called me cherry bomb
Changed my hair from blonde
Mad 'cause I can go investigate the whole Gucci line
Let me live niggas, did this with my own rhymes
Publishing's a motherfucker baby and I own mines
Worked hard, I deserve the best in life
She stay clean, I deserve to be dressed up right
She spits mean, God definitely blessed her right
We can all buy diamonds and furs, nothing to tell
We can all buy the mall, but we all can't sell
Your career's dead wrong, change your style, wear a veil, huh

Mad 'cause we got shit
Dropped what I dropped, shit
Mad 'cause we killing it
All we do is drop hits
Long cash, 21, investigating in stock, shit
Calling, bragging way too long so I could cock shit
Now I'm supposed to downplay all the things I want in life
Got my own money now, ain't gotta be nobody wife
Only if I want to, not 'cause I need to
Choose the situations I do and do not go through
I told you I was gonna make it big, gonna grow
This is dedicated to all of the haters who ain't know
But they know who it was
Haters created my buzz
Talking 'bout me made people wonder who she was
And I'm here now
Going on my second year now
Fuck it, we could take it there, keep at a stare down
Now I think that my message is clear now
That bitch E-V-E, sing it, what you hear now?

Traveling to me away was Atlantic City
Now, float me in a boat in the Atlantic feel me
Gotta come to the table with something 'cause I got mine
Gotta spoil Eve royally, not just like pipeline
Say I ain't your type (Lying), matches make you jelly
I said it before, I can fill my own belly
Uh, need you for what
Get in where you fit in, if you can
I'ma keep it comfortable, that's my plan, understand
I'm just trying to be me, bubbling Philly bitch
Course I'ma boss and floss, I ain't no silly bitch
Bet she come fully equipped from chips to whip
Keys to her own crib, big shit to grip
I'm living it now, so ya simmer it down
Went from who's she to, oh, I remember her now
Niggas couldn't stand her, now they wanna give her a pound
Wanna know her 'cause my feet is planted in the ground, huh
