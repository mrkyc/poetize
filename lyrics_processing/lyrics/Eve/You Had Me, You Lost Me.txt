You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad

Uh, how should I start it off?
You must have thought me soft
Like it was all good to move on and cross me off
We never shared secrets, we wasn't fuckin' raw
Helped you when you were down and now you got the fuckin' gawl
We used to be so tight, we was each others life
You was my husband and no doubt I was your fuckin' wife
Did anythin' you ever asked of Eve
You turned out to be a devil nigga, I couldn't believe
Sneakin' numbers out my phone, callin' bitches on the cell
What the hell? Clunky bitches one on the scale
I'm like a dime over line, you can't calculate my status
And you fuckin' with these bitches like my ass wasn't the fattest
Like I didn't dress the baddest any time we surface
Must have been insecure, niggas made you nervous
And I guess it was your purpose to lock me in
But you fucked up, your lucks out but then again
You might also like
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad

Used to let shit slide, caught a couple lies
I chilled for real, I mean I called a couple guys
Knew when you was fuckin' up, I saw it in your eyes
Then I guess it was my fault 'cause I put up the disguise
In public, we was happy, in home, we'd be scrappin'
Later we'd be naked, jokin', smokin' and laughin'
Makin' up to break up, I thought that shit was love
But it wasn't and I learned the hard way soakin' in suds
Cryin' all depressed, not again, you'll never catch me
Wishin' on a star for some nigga to come bless me
I tried to save it, all you ever did was stress me
Pushin' all my buttons, why the fuck must you stress me?
Nigga, get a life, go on and find a wife
Get the fuck out my face 'fore I go and find a knife
And you still callin' my phone tryna act polite, huh
Askin' me for favors now you know that shit ain't right but
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad, uh, huh

Uh-oh, you see me comin', don't you?
Look at you runnin', won't you?
Oh, you gon' sit there and see me like I want to approach you
Now it's payback, I'm talkin' way back
To bitches callin' hangin' up, you ain't no way to save that
To unanswered questions, to home in the A.M
To you out clubbin', forcin' me to stay in
Remember, okay then, it's over, no playin'
I said it before, I'm about to do it, fuck what you sayin'
Too late for apologies, go puff on a pile of weed
Think about this good bitch that's leavin' and don't follow me
Movin' on, shut you down, now you wanna regret
You could fuck all day, but it would never feel like my sex
Played yourself tried to show I cared, you ain't cared
When I needed you the most, nigga, you wasn't there
And the game is the same; comes around, goes around
Now hate me forever while the chorus goes around, huh
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh (I want you back)
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh (I want you back)
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh (I want you back)
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad
You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh (I want you back)
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad
