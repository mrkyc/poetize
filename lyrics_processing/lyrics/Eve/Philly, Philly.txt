Philly is where I'm from
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm, mm

We from P-H-I-L-A period
P-A period, Eve, they hearin' it
Believe they fearin' it, but lovin' it, though
I hate the game, fuck the fame, but I'm lovin' the dough
You couldn't tell me in a million years
And a thousands bars that I'd roam the reservoir with dogs
Show the world what crew love was about
Drop "Adrenaline!", "4-5-6", I showed 'em what a thug was about
I know you love flossin' with X, bustin' them checks
Getting tattoos, paw prints on your chest
I ain't mad, baby, get that cash
Make them hatin' bitches kiss your ass, Ruff Ryde, lift that strap
I'm gon' walk 'til I see how these fleas gon' feel
When I come through with the whip with the Bs on the wheel
Burgundy thing, cream gut, cherry wood
Steerin' wheel, a B surrounded by the wing on the hood
I know they like, "How they collide?"
He roll with Roc, you Ruff Ryde, but we Black Friday tied
How you think they gon' feel seein' us Grammy night?
Let me tell you, a bunch of ifs, ands and mights
Billboard charts, Source ads and mics
And if I say so myself, goddamn, we tight
Fuck bein' humble, ain't no other way to end this
We ain't open up the door, we knocked that bitch up off the hinges

No doubt we represent P-H-I-L-A period
E-V-E period, fuck with B period
We gon' hold it down for Illadel' for life
Came through, made a name, nigga, nailed it tight
And now we shine, been knew, shit it was 'bout time
Switched from streets to beats, Platinum lines
Used to struggle in the hood just to brodie the mic
Took the fame 'cause they ain't give it us, now we excite
The biggest crowds and they screamin' loud, Philly the shit
Roc-A-Fella rap guerrilla, blonde bombshell bitch
I Ruff Ryde, take your mind, shit, you doin' the same
Work hard, now the streets stay shoutin' our names
Fame is funny, get money, snakes in the grass
When the hostility shows, niggas face get smashed
But I stay grounded, brick house stallion
My bitches keep me real while I make millions
Pile it on, huh, we gon' have it all in a minute
Give it back the hood and we gon' ball in a minute
'Cause anything we want, we gon' have on our plate
Matter of time before we killed it, Beans, it was our fate
And cats is stressed, gave it all, they expected less
Disrespect, take it back the hood, protect your chest
Tried to break us, but we broke through, got the job done
That's what's up, runnin' shit, now tell 'em where I am from
Oh, Philly, Philly
Mm, Philly where I am from
Mm, Phily, Philly
