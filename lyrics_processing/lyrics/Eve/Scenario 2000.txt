(Mmm, mmmm)
See y'all don't understand us you know
Ruff Ryders is a family
Ruff Ryders, Ruff Ryders, Ruff Ryders
Lets go, Swizz Beatz

This is the darkest shit, sparking shit
Hittin' with the hardest shit, 'cause before we started shit
With kids I knew my fuckin' friends all turned against me
Said fuck it, bought me a dog ever since me
And my dog has been like this, he got my back I got his
Schemin' on mad niggas, that's how we do bidz
It's about time to start another, robbin' spree
'Cause yo, my way is highway, robbery, chump
When I was up North in, sing-sing, I was sendin' niggas home in a coffin
Livin' like a orphan
You bad, nigga? I'll be back (Let's) see if you'll be still here
You know my style, I'll put yo' fucking man in a wheelchair
He'll never walk again, on the strength of me
That's how I left him G, scared to death of me
Niggas cannot run, hit with the hot one
From the shotgun, casket close, wonder how he got done

Yo yo, E-V-E, my dogs believe in me
Petty thugs hide yo' cake, never teasin' me
I show love to, all my bitches hustlin' ones
Tussle with thieves, makin' moves, second to none
I locked it, uh, made a sudden move you got bit
Flooded wit the double R, real street shit
Da blond hair bandit, you got guns, hand it
Turn my face when I bust a cannon
'Cause I don't wear sunblock, ask Drag if the fire is hot (Flame on, baby)
Shit pop shells, fall three feet, roll over and stop
We warn niggas that we coming then we total the block
We scorn niggas like their mothers then we wet up their socks
Red dye, escaping on the red-eye, to seashore
Then hide out and buy out bars 'til we see fall
In this game, we beat y'all, you got money? Keep yours
For eyes be tearin' tryin' to identify the features
You might also like
And you can come see me if you tryin' to get some grams tonight
'Cause I can get it for you raw, gray, tan or white
Fuck rap yo, I'd rather be plannin' a flight
Somewhere hot on a wave runner, tanning with dykes
Blowin the haze, while all of 'em givin' me brains
One at a time, y'all start from the front of the line
But everybody wanna contact me and get wit me
But still end up being mad 'cause I charge fifty
And as for you sucka, you can keep those raps
And screw your awards, my son can't eat those plaques
I never was shit but some things I never forget
Like if you spend three you're guaranteed to make back six
Drove the Benz off the lot and just dusted her off
Tints, rims, stash, ticked the governor off
Even the cats that be hatin' still be lovin' the dogs
'Cause they know that the double R's comin' for war
Wha

If you ain't ready to die, then why should you live?
'Cause when I start bustin' the guns, you hidin' the kids
And the P is still ridin' with clips, survivin' with bricks
We beefin' on the 4th you got to die on the 5th
Like I wasn't hustlin' dope or robbin' the blocks
Starvin' or not, carvin' the cheek, palmin' the Glock
I figure which nigga could I watch with a watch
I like to knock off my crack then I pull off a heist
Put it together, double it twice, this shit is my life
Catch me with a 45, hot pair of Nikes
And three red dice, like, give me the bank or give me your face
Give me a shank, it's Holiday ugh
The hoopties in the front but the truck is a mile away
Niggas wanna ride tomorrow when they prob'ly die today
'Cause the P'll hollow the guns
Holla at sons (I feel you, nigga)
And when they go to holla back
They be swallowin' one
(Uh, uh, uh)
Y'all dem bust in them crowd niggas and hit whoever
When you should aim for them niggas that took yo' leather
They right there, but you scared that they gon' bust
'Cause they crazy, but crazy niggas bleed like us
See I'm one shot through the heart like Cupid
Y'all niggas might be crazy, but y'all not stupid
It's '99, I'm killings you women and kids
Fuck Scarface! Watch me, I'm more action to see
Than them motherfuckers that y'all see on T.V
And fuck what you heard this how Sheek get down
Comes to guns? Shit I'm rhyming with one on me now
You never know what clown goin' walk into the studio
Talking shit and it's gonna be more than the amps that blow
I pour gas on your skin and watch your shit detach
With a book of matches now that's when you have met your match
And the worst thing for you is to have a gun when I'm thirsty
I turn niggas more holy man, than Eddie Murphy
And I deal with more bricks than that city do in jersey
Y'all got call cops niggas, I got autops niggas, that'll bust you and slide
And some ol' 6-drop niggas
Revolver Pop niggas, Eezox niggas
Get knocked, say I smoke detox niggas
Drug program, hit the streets and cop 56 mo grams
Y'all niggas ain't fuckin' with the fam
And that's word
(Come on, come on, come on,)
Boy, what's the difference between fire and water?
You'd rather drown or die of torture, 'cause your skins of ya
And watch ya burn off fat, dog, I'm off the thermostat
Could put a comb to my mouth and give yo' bitch a perm with that
Keep shells in the envelopes 'cause I'll mail out bullets
More blood than a riot on a jailhouse footage
Buck 40, 'bout a extra 20 wit the semi
When it hit you, you gon' do a 360 pretty swiftly
When I burn you to a crisp, you gon' be crunchier than chips
With mah hand all up in da bag munchin' on tha shit
Bit by bit, clip by clip and every block by block
Is brick on brick I got knots on knots
'Cause I got things that'll pop yo top
And double R spot yo block with 16 shots and watch y'all drop
And ain't nobody gettin' up, 'less they in the wheelchair
