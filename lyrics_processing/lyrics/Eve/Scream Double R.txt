Keep motherfuckers knowin' this rap shit is our world (What?)
Been there and done that (Uh), had fun where the run at (Uh)
Ain't got to shoot a motherfucker no more, so put the gun back (Uh)
Pay niggas to do that 'cause they a lot better at it
Keep the burner in the truck 'cause well you got to have it (Aight)
It's an unwritten law (Uh-huh)

Hit 'em with four (Uh) hairline to the jaw (What?)

It should be against the law, me and the dog like a brawl
And the only thing that can help you is God and you should call on him
Weak sight, the streets like, yo, creep like
'Cause they got each other's she bark and he bite
It ain't strange, you cats know the name
Double R, scream it, bubble hard, it's a shame
Realest niggas doin' it, them clowns, they ruin it
Shut 'em down, give 'em pounds 'cause palms go glue in it
Sticky finger niggas, huh, steal each other's style (Woo)
Claimin' how they started things not original
Cats they get caught up in the glitter and glam
If that's the case, you should be considered a fan
I'm like tired of the same beats, they claim streets
Doing nothing but duckin' from the hood, got the same speech
Only one you feeling is you, niggas know the deal
Industry, fuck it, in the streets keep it real, nigga
Get that ass up and scream double R (What!)
We ain't going nowhere we made it this far (Uh)
Let me see my, my dogs *growls*

Since the beginnin' we both knew we was winnin'
'Cause we been in all type of shit (Uh) but kept on spittin', hittin' (Woo)
Niggas in the head with that shit that let 'em know it was the truth
So they feel that 'cause it's real black (What?)
We never gon' to stop (Uh), no matter what they say (Uh)
No matter what they do (Uh), they'll never take it away (Come On)
What the Lord give you, let no man curse
E-V-E and DMX from the birth to the Earth

Why they sick? 'Cause we still close, thought that it was over
Cats tryna tear us apart, dogs got closer
All the shit we deal with only make us stronger
Try to do a lot of shit but they can't belong to
For real niggas scared us, steady catching them bluffin'
What you say? Shut up, nigga, sayin' much of nothin'
Act like they don't want it, huh, but they demand it
Double R, keep it hard and niggas can't stand it
Get that ass up and scream double R (What!)
We ain't going nowhere we made it this far (Uh)
Let me see my, my dogs *growls*
Let me hear my, my dogs *barks*
