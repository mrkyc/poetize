Damn, she flipped it, when gone they missed it
Been on 'cause they can't stop her climb
Uh, nigga, you digs it?

To make sure I made it mine, huh

Fucked the game up (Uh)

'Cause none can tame us, the game'll never drain us

But it's the problems and the pressure that they can't see

And it was nothin', caught you stuntin', got no room to breathe
