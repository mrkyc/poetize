C'mon
Yeah
What?
Shit
You, me, and she
What we gonna do, baby?
Baby?
Yo, shit

I did it to myself, couldn't help the way I felt about him
Sick when he wasn't there, like I never dealt without him
Played the fool by choice, all I had was this man
Let him have the best of both worlds 'cause it was his plan
All the things I wanted to hear, he told me gently
Whatever it was, wanted nothin', gave me plenty
Told me that he split with this chick, but couldn't shake her
'Cause she had his kid, so he fed her with his paper
First it started off like that, dough for closure
Started slackin' off, in fact, it wasn't over
Now my world is crumblin' down, I'm feelin' shaky
Used to bein' Superwoman, no bitch could replace me
Wanted him to leave me alone, but I was caught up
Thought I was strong, broke down when breakin' up was brought up
Tried to really ride with this dude, I thought I loved him
And every time I'd ask what I should do, he said trust him

You, me, and she
What we gonna do, baby? (Trust me)
Baby? (Hold me, yeah)
You, me, and she
What we gonna do, baby? (Believe me)
Baby? (You need me, yeah)

Damn, I must be crazy, feedin' into bullshit
Attitudes and tryna hold out, that shit was useless
The more I tried to back up, the more he kept comin'
Lie after lie, shit, lyin' wasn't nothin'
Tear after tear come down, tellin' me be cool
All I need is you, baby, nobody could be you
Believed him, he deceived me just to keep me
Callin' me from her spot, sayin' how he need me
I had to step back, he got me stressed out
This ain't what I planned, thought I had my life sketched out
Huh, I guess not, love me to hurt me
Hurt me to make up, then make up to desert me

You, me, and she
What we gonna do, baby? (Trust me)
Baby? (Hold me, yeah)
You, me, and she
What we gonna do, baby? (Believe me)
Baby? (You need me, yeah)
Back and forth with the he said, he said got me dizzy
If I leave, know the routine, he beg 'cause he miss me
Too late, 'cause you had me, lost me, daddy, move on
Boss bitch, no more floss me, nigga, I'm gone
Arguments for hours, me and her comparin' notes and
After all the screamin' stop, we comparin' quotes
You got sloppy, thought you was that nigga let me catch you
Heart didn't hurt 'til I covered up your tattoo
My statue on a pedestal, every breath too
Never knew the worst 'til you felt what the best do
And I'm that, it's over now, hope I stressed you
But niggas only do what we allow, and I let you

You, me, and she
What we gonna do, baby? (Trust me)
Baby? (Hold me, yeah)
You, me, and she
What we gonna do, baby? (Believe me)
Baby? (You need me, yeah)
You, me, and she
What we gonna do, baby? (Trust me)
Baby? (Hold me, yeah)
You, me, and she
What we gonna do, baby? (Believe me)
Baby? (You need me, yeah)
Me, nigga
Trust me
Hold me, yeah
Believe me
