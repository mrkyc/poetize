Don't like waiting, don't like waiting
Let's go right now
Gotta hit the ground dancin' 'fore the music slows down
What I'm saying, what I'm saying
If there's something to fix
Take it to another level, this is the remix

Everybody, everybody get out on the floor
It can get a little crazy when the kick hits the floor
Make a scene, make a scene nobody can ignore
Don't knock it 'til you rock it
We can't take it no more

Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up
DJ, set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up

Shake it up
You might also like
Break it down, break it down
I got something to say
When you're dancing with me
It's like we go M.I.A
Make a scene, make a scene nobody can ignore
Don't knock it 'til you rock it
We can't take it no more

Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up
DJ, set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up

Sh-sh-sh-shake it up
You got to change it up
And if the day's not right
Just brush it off tonight
Put on the attitude
You're in the pocket mood
And when you've had enough
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up
Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up
DJ, set it off, take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up
(Shake it up)

Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up (Shake it up, shake it up)
DJ, set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up

Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up (Shake it up, shake it up)
DJ, set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
