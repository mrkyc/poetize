Now that I have captured your attention
I wanna steal you for a rhythm intervention
Mr. TSA, I'm ready for inspection
Sh-sh-show me how you make a first impression

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow?
Break it down and drop it low, low
'Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights
'Til you can't let me go (Ah)

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
(Slow, slow) Yeah, baby, slow down the song
(Slow, slow) Yeah, baby, slow down the song

If you want me, I'm accepting applications
So long as we can keep this record on rotation
You know I'm good with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Breathe me in, breathe me out
So amazin'

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow?
Break it down and drop it low, low
'Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights
'Til you can't let me go (Ah)

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
(Slow, slow) Yeah, baby, slow down the song
(Slow, slow) Yeah, baby, slow down the song

(Breathe me in, breathe me out)
The music's got me going
(Breathe me in, breathe me out)
No stopping 'til the morning
(Breathe me in, breathe me out)
You know I'm ready for it, for it, for it, yeah
(Breathe me in, breathe me out)
The music's got me going
(Breathe me in, breathe me out)
No stopping 'til the morning
(Breathe me in, breathe me out)
You know I'm ready for it, for it, for it, yeah
(It's The Cataracs)
(Ah)

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
(Slow, slow) Yeah, baby, slow down the song
(Slow, slow) Yeah, baby, slow down the song

How do I do it?
It-It-It's The Cataracs
