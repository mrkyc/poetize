So and so and on and on  (Oh, yeah)
If I want you gone, you gone
I sent that pack, you goin' long (Oh, yeah)
Either way, you holdin' strong
I'm lookin' back how far we come (Uh-huh)
Oh, yeah, I did it, done
Hello, hello, what's up? What's up?
You tryna play around with me or you gon' fuck (Yeah), on and on
Hear that clap, hear that clap, on and on

Don't stay too long, you might fall in love
Praying to the stars and my God above
But she won't leave 'cause my diamonds VV's
Had to get her back and caught a flight overseas
Get it in priority, I'm playin' with p's
Sippin' on that, um, it's that Texas and tea

Show me some respect, girl, don't you hide it
I don't need no Henny, I get violent
I done caught this wave, and, oh, it's vibrant
Catch me in that Lamb', I put in mileage, wow
Show me some respect, girl, don't you hide it
I don't need no Henny, I get violent
I done caught this wave, and, oh, it's vibrant
Catch me in that Lamb', I put in mileage, wow

I thought we had love, you needed my company
I took that to my heart like that rosary
You not knowin' me, now I'm ridin' off to that Jodeci
You let her play around (Uh-huh), you need a golden league

Show me some respect, girl, don't you hide it
I don't need no Henny, I get violent
I done caught this wave, and, oh, it's vibrant
Catch me in that Lamb', I put on mileage

So and so and on and on
