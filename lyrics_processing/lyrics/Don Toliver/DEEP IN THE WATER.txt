You get to move five ways
You tend to let it wait
You might just lose your head
You don't do what I say

Deep in the water, far as I can see (I can see)
Deep in the water, it's just you and me
Deep in the water, far as I can see (Can see)
Deep in the water, through your pregnancy

Sex and love, sex and love

Yes, I knew you were the rush
I'm fucking OD, yes, at the SLS (You need everything, yeah)
You said you wanna take control of me but I got all the answers
You want me done with the strip club, you know I'm done with them dancers
Well, we made love under the moonlight, we took all our chances, oh

Deep in the water, far as I can see (I can see)
Deep in the water, it's just you and me (Yeah)
Deep in the water, far as I can see (Can see, ooh)
Deep in the water, through your pregnancy (Deep in the water, yeah)

Sex and love, sex and love

Guess we movin' too fast
Whatever you do right now, you know I can't go back
You try to leave me, damn near caught a heart attack
Well, I'm in the H right now, got my hand deep down in the sack
Hit the blunt with a bean in it, come and sit and relax
While I'm in down the A right now, my chopper damn near caught flat
Call me if you want somethin'
Know I feel your heartbeat
Don't act like you don't love nobody
Tell him that you love me
Say, "Yes, I do", say, "Yes, I do", say, "Yes, I do"

Deep in the water, far as I can see (I can see)
Deep in the water, it's just you and me
Deep in the water, far as I can see (Can see)
Deep in the water, through your pregnancy

Call me if you want somethin'
Know I feel your heartbeat
Don't act like you don't love nobody
