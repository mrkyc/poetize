You went too long, and you know it's time to see me
In and out the state, yeah, this shit up for take, yeah
You mistreat the ho (Yeah), make her feel out of place, yeah
That's a big mistake, I cannot relate, huh
Me and my girl movin' at a pace, hmm
If that shit movin' too fast, I hit the brakes

I said, "What's up, ho? It's boolin', I'm back again"
Tell your friend, though, I can see the money through the lens
