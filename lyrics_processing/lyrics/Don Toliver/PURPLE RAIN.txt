Your boy goin' wild in the box style Chevy
Them hoes comin' in and they comin' in heavy
Let a nigga know when them bitches gettin' ready
Let a nigga know when them bitches gettin' ready
The boy goin' wild, got his chain on confetti
The double-R truck, got the big boy in a Bentley
Let a nigga know when them bitches gettin' ready
Let a nigga know when them bitches gettin' ready
Gettin' ready, better hold it steady
Got a couple bitches ready to eat it down in LA
Mix-switch swaggin', put the jacket on, it's Pelle
Pelle Pelle, ridin' through that Bentley
Back then, I knew them hoes couldn't fuck with me
Now I see them ugly hoes tryna cut with me
It's me and brodie rollin' dice, I got that cutter with me
I love my lil' gangster bitch, she wanna get gutter with me
