We the Best Music
Another one
DJ Khaled

Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it (Ayy), I did it, I did it, I did it

Take it off then bend over, let me see it
If you're lookin' for a trill type bitch, let me be it
I'm from the South, never had a handout
'Fore I let my people starve, I'll take it out your mouth
These bitches so quick to switch up
I'm from the Lone Star, I don't need to clique up
It ain't directed, so it ain't respected
Stop droppin' clues 'cause I ain't no detective, bitch
I'm tryna win, don't care how I do it, just know that I did it
Why you so worried 'bout what I be doin'?
Countin' my money ain't makin' you rich
Talkin' down on me don't make you the shit
How my name in your mouth more than your spit?
I really encourage my haters to talk
Throwin' that shade only keepin' me lit, huh

Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it

Hey, goddammit, I get it
They don't like to see when we win, but I did it
Hey, I stand by my city
Chopsticks sound like a guitar in the air
Stop and take a picture when I'm jumpin' off a Lear
I done ran it up, it only took a couple years
The money be callin', if it wasn't for my lil' partner
Then the bullshit they be talkin' 'bout, I wouldn't even hear
New sports car go, "Vroom," switch gears
Hey, how you? Goddamn, come here
Thought of goin' vegan, then again, I'm like, "For what?"
I got ten karats each in my left and right ears
'21 Tesla, I don't even gotta steer
My climax ain't even nowhere near it
I stayed down and I stayed down
And I came up, I had faith in my spirit
Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it (Go), I did it, I did it, I did it

Diamonds on my neck
New contract, I ain't signin' that ho yet
Private plane flyin' somewhere, smilin' on the jet
I drop hit after hit, now that's the domino effect
These niggas out here goin' flat
Ain't no stoppin' it, pink and blue paper all day like Monopoly
Brand new Pradas, I'm proud of me
Actually came from the bottom
Ain't no need in even askin' me, ain't even seen the half of me
And ain't no passin', that's a no-go
Start them killer player niggas out here throwin' low blows
I done got good with the shit
I tell the paparazzi, "Get my angle," every time they take my photo (Another one)

Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
