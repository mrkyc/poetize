On your mind (Another one, yeah, yeah)

I had some problems back home (So I heated up)
I ain't with that bullshit at all (Then I laid it down)
Maybe it's that Virginia in me (Nigga, say somethin')
Have a young nigga go so hard (And stay stuntin')
Oh, but through it all, you stuck with me
Through it all, you never ducked off like them cowards
When it hit me, get me?
Girl, I swear to God, you the real one and you know it
And I don't hurt anyone of y'all for the real one and you know it
And I'll hold it down
We started from the bed, ended up on the floor
And I'll lift that ass up off the ground
I'ma put you on my shoulders, let me give you what's in store
Girl, you deserve it, all the time you been servin'
Away from the realest nigga in here, I'ma take you away
And I'll hold you down, I'ma hold you down

Put you in that Ghost so you enjoy the town
Even when the roses die, you mesmerized by the flyin' sky
We gotta socialize and cherish times (Git, git)
This shit is deeper than love
I pull up in that Lamborghini (Woo), the doors in the sky
Shit is straight up suicide
You in that new Bentley truck, new, new Bentley truck, oh (Murder)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

We go to Abu Dhabi for a hobby (Git, git)
