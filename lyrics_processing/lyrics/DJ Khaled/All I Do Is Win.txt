DJ Khaled! Hey! (Nasty Beatmakers)
Yeah, We the best!

All I do is win, win, win, no matter what (What)
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough ('Nough)
And every time I step up in the building everybody hands go up
And they stay there (There)
And they say, "Yeah!" (Yeah!), and they stay there
(Up, down, up, down, up, down)
'Cause all I do is win (Win), win (Win), win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air, make 'em stay there (Yeah, listen, Luda!)

Ludacris goin' in on the verse 'cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now (Woo)
Keep your hands up, get 'em in the sky for the homies that didn't make it and my folks locked down (Woo)
I never went nowhere (No), but they sayin' "Luda's back" (Yeah)
Blame it on that conjure (Haa!), the hood call it Luda 'gnac (Ahh!)
And I'm on this foolish track so I spit my foolish flow (Flow)
My hands go up and down (Down), like strippers' booties go (Woo!)
My verses still be servin' (Yup), tight like a million virgins (Yup)
Last time on the Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version (Yah!)
Can't never count me out (No), y'all better count me in (Yo)
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in (Woo)
Make millions every year (Yeah) the South's champion (Yeah)
'Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I, all I do is
You might also like
All I do is win, win (Ayy), win, no matter what (Wooo)
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough ('Nough)
And every time I step up in the building everybody hands go up
And they stay there (There)
And they say, "Yeah!" (Yeah!), and they stay there
(Up, down, up, down, up, down)
'Cause all I do is win (Win), win (Win), win (Who?)
And if you goin' in (Boss) put your hands in the air (Boss), make 'em stay there

Swervin' in my lo-lo, head on the swivel
You know serving me's a no-no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger, they see it they say, "Oh boy", tell Khaled "Back it up"
My niggas call me loco, down for armed trafficking
Don't make me pull that fo'-fo', ask you what you laughing at (What?)
Represent that mud life (Mud life)
Dirty money bitch you better get yo' mud right (Mud right)
We come together holdin' hands and holla "Thug life" ("Thug Life")
We all strapped in all black, it's like fuck life (Fuck life), all we do is win!
You ridin' to what (What) 'cause we ridin' tonight (Tonight)
Now she ridin' with me 'cause you wasn't ridin' her right, Ross!

All I do is win, win, win, no matter what (What)
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough ('Nough)
And every time I step up in the building everybody hands go up
And they stay there (There)
And they say, "Yeah!" (Yeah!), and they stay there
(Up, down, up, down, up, down)
'Cause all I do is win (Win), win (Win), win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air, make 'em stay there
Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
Water gettin' boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I been runnin' this rap game since I was twenty years old (What? What?)
I hung with the worst of 'em, bust 'til I burst 'em up
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me, I'm bossin' up, pressure up, bless you, bruh
Don't mess with us, we like the U in the '80s
Back to back, set a trap, hit the lick, hit it back
Hit the trick, jump the track, bitch, I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sippin' on this gin
Al Davis said it best, "Just win baby, win"

All I do is win, win, win, no matter what (What)
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough ('Nough)
And every time I step up in the building everybody hands go up
And they stay there (There)
And they say, "Yeah!" (Yeah!), and they stay there
(Up, down, up, down, up, down)
'Cause all I do is win (Win), win (Win), win
