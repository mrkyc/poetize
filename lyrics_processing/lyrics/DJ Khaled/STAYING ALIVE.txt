How she in love and she been over once?
It's not like I known her for months
This life, it allowed me to take what I want
It's not like I know what I want
It's not like I know what I need
I get some time, but there's no guarantees
When I was broke, she was bein' a tease
Four pockets full, now she down on her knees
Woah, woah, woah-woah
Baby gon' hit it, then send her to me, yeah
Or I'ma hit it and send her to Baby
