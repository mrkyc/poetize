(TouchofTrent be wildin' with it)

Pussy drippin' on the dick, be tryna get nasty
When you spendin' six figures in a store they gotta bag it
You can't blame me, the shit you doin', it got me braggin'
When I touch her hair when you get it done, you turnin' ratchet, hmm

Mmm, and the difference is
My bitch bad and she killin' them
Mmm, and the difference is
We don't put the world in our business still

And they keep askin'
Sexy lil' bitch put her on her mink lashes
I'm talkin' Gucci glasses or Chanel team jacket
She gon' get it without asking, she on queen status
You ridin' solo in that foreign, don't need to pass the blunt
I know them niggas feelin' stupid, whoever passed you up
I put my fingers in her private in the restaurant
And she get mad when I'm off them drugs 'cause I don't cum fast enough
I'm in her tummy, steady comin', I give her another liter
She steady runnin', pussy yummy cut on that Justin Bieber
When I was nothin', gave her a hunnid, I did a couple features
Don't let her see the other side, I be with them demons

Mmm, and the difference is
My bitch bad and she killin' them
Mmm, and the difference is

Side bitch, main bitch (Yeah)
Right hand, left hand
Lil Durk is a dirty dawg with that shit that she kept hidden
Vouch to lose my life into the streets, that's what I kept sayin'
Besides my best man, my bitch my best friend
Pullin' covers in the parking lot (Hmm, hmm, hmm)
Backseat, she made me cum a lot (Hmm, hmm, hmm)
When I decide to love, I love a lot (Hmm, hmm, hmm)
I got you in your bag, I touched you up (Hmm, hmm, hmm)
