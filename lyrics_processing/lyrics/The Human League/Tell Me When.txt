Tell me when (Will I?)
Tell me when (Will I?)
Tell me when
Will I see you again? (Tell me when)

Kelly took a lifetime searching for the bottom line
I wasn't into searching, 'cause I was doing fine
I wasn't into fighting, chasing, sweating, slaving, fretting, racing
Any waste of effort isn't part of my design
Billy was an inspiration, positive and kind
Until he let confusion overcome his youthful mind
Common sense dictated
I could never be so blind
And then
Then I see you

(Tell me when) Will I see you again?
(Tell me when) Will I see you again?
(Tell me when) Will I see you again?
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

Happenstance an episode, unplanned alone in time
Coincidence, the second chance resounding like a rhyme
How paths may cross against the odds to wreck the plans you made
Among the crowd a face that smiles to melt your masquerade
"If only I could see you", says the stranger deep inside
And lets you know that when you were so sure you really lied
"If only I could see you", says the voice within your brain
And quietly, insistently it says it once again
And then, I really need to know

It wouldn't seem so lonely
If only I could see you
Baby, you can be free
If only I could see you
You'll never have to doubt me
If only I could see you
Baby, you could free me
If only I could see you
If only I could see you (Tell me when)

(Tell me when)
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

(Tell me when) Will I see you again?
(Tell me when) Will I see you again?
(Tell me when) Will I see you again?
Then
I really need to know

If only, if only, if only I could see you (Will I see you again?)
If only I could see you
If only, if only, if only I could see you (Will I see you again?)
Will I see you again?
If only, if only, if only I could see you (Will I see you again?)
If only, if only, if only I could see you (Will I see you again?)
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
(Tell me when) If only, if only, if only I could see you
Will I see you again?
(Tell me when)
Will I see you again?
(Tell me when) If only, if only, if only I could see you
