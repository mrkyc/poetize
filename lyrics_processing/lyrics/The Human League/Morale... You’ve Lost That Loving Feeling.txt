Don't talk
Close the door
You've been here before
Your shape dim
I'm an old man now
The air's thin
The walls very damp now
And if I don't go
I'll always be stuck here in this poor little room
With a view of the corner
I don't forget
The light growing weak now
Experience is useless
Unless you can learn
And I've never met anyone
Who used their knowledge
To avoid those mistakes made again and again
And if I don't go
I'll always be stuck here in this poor little room
With a view of the corner

You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it (baby)
But baby, baby I know it
You've lost that loving feeling
Woah, that loving feeling
You've lost that loving feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone
Woah-woah-woah
Now there's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you
And girl you're starting to criticise little things I do
It makes me just feel like crying (baby)
'Cos, baby, something beautiful's dying
You've lost that loving feeling
Woah, that loving feeling
You've lost that loving feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone
Woah-woah-woah
Baby, baby, I'd get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me like you used to do, yeah
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find every day
So don't, don't, don't, don't let it slip away
Bring back that loving feeling
Woah, that loving feeling
Bring back that loving feeling
Cause it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on
Woah-woah-woah
Baby (baby), Baby (baby)
I beg you please (woooo)
Please (woooo)
I need your love (I need your love)
I need your love now (I need your love now)
Now it bring it on back (bring it on back)
