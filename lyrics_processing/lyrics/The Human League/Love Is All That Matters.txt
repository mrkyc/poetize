Love for giving, love for good
Love to keep us faithful
After all is said and done
Love is all that matters

Got this beautiful situation
I've finally found out what life's about
Want to talk about it in my conversation
Going to tell the world
Going to sing it from the highest mountain top

Love for giving (Love), love for good (For good)
Love to keep us faithful (Woah-woah-woah, love)
After all is said and done (Done)
Love is all that matters

Every person pledge allegiance
All our efforts to one common cause
Take a minute to improve a life
Form a legion that's united for a love cause
