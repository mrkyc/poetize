Nigga just got off his ass
Flew up out here to really talk some shit with these niggas (Frrp)
You wanna talk, you can talk hella shit (Boat, Boat)
On God, look, yeah

My doctor almost died, I made my bitch go and clean his spit
Yeah, on my mama, I need him here
He gon' write the scripts 'til he dip to go hang with Kobe
Wraith pulled me over, no question, he didn't owe me
Damn, this bitch just called my name like she really know me
Ain't a rap nigga in the world that can say they ho'd me
I just got a S-I-G in the back foldin'
I bought SRTs in my sleep, it didn't hurt my pockets
I just saw a sealed pint of Act' and it hurt my sockets
Real VVS on my bitch, ain't no heart lockets
I live on the lake, leave the crib and forgot to lock it
It's okay, I got cameras there
And my brothers sleep in the upstairs, we got hammers there
And my other brother trap close, he got Pamela there
Good with the block like Tyson Chandler was there

What the fuck is one pint? I wanna buy a load
I got the plug to send them bricks, I'm tryna find Lil Boat
Tired of buyin' jewelry and cars, I'm finna buy a goat
Shit, sixty pointers in my ear

Ain't got no feelings but I told my lil' bitch it's gon' hurt if you hurt me

Start my day off with a six of some Purp and a Perky
If the pastor sold dope I walk in the church with a turkey

Two Gs just put on me, pourin' drank right out the pint
I got bitches sellin' pussy, look like Tyra Banks
I'm rockin' Chrome Hearts, shootin' basketball just like I'm Drake
This shit ain't nothin' to my niggas
Youngest nigga in my crew, got like six figures

Glock hit him from three different ways, he caught all angles
Walkin' through the set with 'seppis on, buyin' Palm Angel

Add another body to the count, then take the gun back

Keep up, the way that we been goin', we ahead, ahead
Nigga, just five years ago, I was scared of red
We was droppin' Act' like droppin' trash in the trash can
Ooh, yeah, it was nothin' to it
Told her that her pussy ain't shit unless I nut into it
I can't really do no extra shit, I do enough movin'
I would go and buy another brick but ain't enough movin'
I heard Flint niggas gettin' love but do too much shootin'
You ain't really active like we is, you do too much coolin'
Droolin', park my car wherever 'til I move it
I'm nasty, fartin', out to eat and don't excuse it
Bro, I hate that I can buy whatever now 'cause I abuse
Bought a pint just to pour four fours just to do it
Buyin' jewelry 'cause I put myself on off of music
Take my Perc' fast 'cause I'm already high and I might lose it
This a hunnid cash and I can count it out to you to prove it
It's amazin', I'm still out here dodgin' dope cases
Might drop a 2020 Benz, same color as a raisin
Louie split a Perc' 30 with me and made me take it
Three-five of A1 in the 'Wood, had to face it
Had my crib slappin' like the car, I guess that's why they raided me
When I was sellin' dope I had a couple fiends that stay with me
Ten thousand dollars in a day, you can't make a G
Two hunnid a gram and I'm stiff, you gotta come to me
It's all hustle, ain't no love for me
Got my old and my new bitch, they baby daddy can't fuck with me
