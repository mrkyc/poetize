People say it's too bad
But don't forget what you had
I don't care who you were from before, babe
Stick like a new magnet

I know you don't think
You mean as much to me
But the way that you move your body, baby
Is a full moon fantasy

Keep me in the moment
Tell me how it feels
Tell me I'm the only
One to kiss you just the way you like it, baby
Don't it, don't it feel so real?
Knowin' I'm the only
One to kiss you just the way you like it, baby

I know you like to move fast
And I've been on the do that
But I'm taking you a step at a time, babe
And I don't wanna move backwards
You might also like
I know you don't think
You mean as much to me
But the way that you move your body baby
Is a full moon fantasy fantasy

Keep me in the moment
Tell me how it feels
Tell me I'm the only
One to kiss you just the way you like it, baby
Don't it, don't it feel so real?
Knowin' I'm the only
One to kiss you just the way you like it, baby

(Just the way you like it, baby)
(Just the way you like it, like it)
Oh, I know she got 'em
World on hold with the phone on silent, ayy
Oh, I know she got 'em
Not another man who can love you the loudest
Say, smoked wing for your silhouette now
Quick break for your cigarette
Let me levitate, let me levitate
Keep me in the moment
Tell me how it feels
Tell me I'm the only
One to kiss you just the way you like it, baby
Don't it, don't it feel so real?
Knowin' I'm the only
One to kiss you just the way
Keep me in the moment
Tell me how it feels
Tell me I'm the only
One to kiss you just the way you like it, baby
Don't it, don't it feel so real?
Knowin' I'm the only
