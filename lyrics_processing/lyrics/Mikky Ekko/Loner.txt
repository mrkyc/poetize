Been too long, far too cracked
To call cease fire and fall like that way
So tie my hands and light the match
And wait for the fire to break my back again
Love, we're not the enemies we wanna be tonight
Love, leave all the weaponry and jealousy behind

Cause I'm not a loner, and I'll be a loner 'til my lover comes over
I'm not a loner, but I'll be in pain until this suffering is over
So why don't you come on, come on, come over?
Come on, come on, come over
So why don't you come on, come on, come over?
Come on, come on, come over

Back to back face to face
Love is war and I can taste the blade
So cut me deep and cut me loose
Cause I won't surrender, won't call truce today
Love, we're not the enemies we wanna be tonight

Cause I'm not a loner, and I'll be a loner 'til my lover comes over
I'm not a loner, but I'll be in pain until this suffering is over
So why don't you come on, come on, come over?
Come on, come on, come over
So why don't you come on, come on, come over?
Come on, come on, come over
You might also like
I've seen fire and I know pain
But I never looked back when you called my name
I've seen fire and I know pain
But I never looked back when you called my name

Cause I'm not a loner, and I'll be a loner 'til my lover comes over
I'm not a loner, but I'll be in pain until this suffering is over
So why don't you come on, come on, come over?
Come on, come on, come over
So why don't you come on, come on, come over?
