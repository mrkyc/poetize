What's it like now? Let's just say it's hard to remember
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Every light's out, every scar's open and tender
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Make me your prophet of stage
Say you just rattle your cage
Only to realize you're all still living in the world

What's it like now? What's it like now? (What's it like now)
What's it like now? What's it like now? (What's it like now)
What's it like now? What's it like now? (What's it like now)
What's it like now? What's it like now? (What's it like now)

What's it like now? I become your favorite pretender
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
You keep me tied down, keep your mind off of my temper
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
One day they'll laugh in your face
You put your past in the grave
Only to realize the future's still out in the wild

I sleep in alleyways and waterfalls to find where I begin
I see the future and the past, I feel the present caving in
I wash my hands of it and trade it for a world inside my head
Can't remember what you said
