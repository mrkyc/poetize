Here we are
Children of the wild, yeah we bear the scars
Reminders of the pain and the sacrifice
We're the blood, sweat and tears that have paid the price
And we paid the price

But it's crazy how we wait so long
How we wait so long to come together

When the river runs dry
And you have nothing left to give
And the stars have lost their shine
I will, I will burn for you
When the darkness comes
To try and steal your pride
Don't lose hope, you tell them
We are, we are made of light

So here I am
Take me if you want me
Pull me through your fire, teach me how to learn
Cause I'm so afraid, I don't know what it means to love
So afraid what I give is never enough
You might also like
But it's crazy how we wait so long
How we wait so long to come together

When the river runs dry
And you have nothing left to give
And the stars have lost their shine
I will, I will burn for you
When the darkness comes
To try and steal your pride
Don't lose hope, you tell them
We are, we are made of light

I know you've been alone, alone so long
I see you though, in fullness of
Defeat and pain and broken lungs
We wait until we're old enough
We are, we are made of light

When the river runs dry
And you have nothing left to give
And the stars have lost their shine
I will, I will burn for you
When the darkness comes
To try and steal your pride
Don't lose hope, you tell them
We are, we are made of light
When the darkness comes, we will be holding on
Oh no we're not afraid, we learned to chase the Sun
And where the river runs, we will be waiting for you
And when the darkness comes, you will be waiting for me
We waited so long, we had to work along
Never afraid of ever giving enough
The wild children of, we will be holding on
Oh no we're not afraid, we learned to chase the Sun
And where the river runs, we will be waiting for you
And when the darkness comes, you will be waiting for me
