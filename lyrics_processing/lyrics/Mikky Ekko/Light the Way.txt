Feel like a creep
Less that you give, the more I want you
You call me a freak
Hanging around, the ghost that haunts you

I know (I know)
I been (I been)
Alone (Alone)
Too long (Too long)
You all (You all)
Ways said (Ways said)
That I was good for nothing
I put my playlist on, oh-oh
And you hate every song, oh-oh

We are, we are, we know we're not the same as yesterday
We all, we always set ourselves on fire to light the way

Future is bleak
Hands of the clock, the hands that taunt you
So fucking cheap
Just how I feel, the man that wants you
You might also like
I know (I know)
I been (I been)
Alone (Alone)
Too long (Too long)
You all (You all)
Ways said (Ways said)
That I was good for nothing
Gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out of this place
I've gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out

We are, we are, we know we're not the same as yesterday
We all, we always set ourselves on fire to light the way
We are, we are, we know we're not the same as yesterday
We all, we always set ourselves on fire to light the way

Your love is such a cannonball
You said what you waiting for
You'll soar like a cannonball, like a cannonball, like a cannonball, splash
I've drunk an ocean everyday
I've poured myself into the sea
I don't belong
I don't know what I have 'til more is shown to me
I don't come down, I want it all
I want your pain, I want your peace
'Til it's all a force on me
We are, we are, we know we're not the same as yesterday
We all, we always set ourselves on fire to light the way
We are, we are, we know we're not the same as yesterday
