Look at how far we've come
Look at this mess we've made
I'm still praying that the sun
Tears my body from the shade
Tell me that we're too far gone
Tell me that we'll be okay
Swear to God I'd leave right now
If Heaven wasn't so far away

But this is not an exercise
And nobody gets out alive
Stop, what if I, what if I stop?

Mourning doves, meet me in the morning
Love, what if I, what if I die before you wake?
Promise, I promise you can lean on me, lean on me
I can be your shoulder
There's still room for us to pull over
But we can't stop
So in the morning, love
We can be together like mourning doves

Yeah, realize that no escape
Releases you from your mistakes
Oh, this is not a warning
But innocence is calling
And I sense that's it's a falling embrace
You might also like
Cause this is not an exercise
And nobody gets out alive
Stop, what if I, what if I stop?

Mourning doves, meet me in the morning
Love, what if I, what if I die before you wake?
Promise, I promise you can lean on me, lean on me
I can be your shoulder
There's still room for us to pull over
But we can't stop
So in the morning, love
We can be together like mourning doves
We can be together like mourning doves

Because we both know
We're running out of time
We're running out of time
Listen, listen, listen
Listen

Mourning doves, meet me in the morning
Love, what if I, what if I die before you wake?
Promise, I promise you can lean on me, lean on me
I can be your shoulder
There's still room for us to pull over
But we can't stop
So in the morning, love
We can be together like mourning doves
We can be together like mourning doves
Mourning doves (we can be together like, we can be together like, we can be together like)
