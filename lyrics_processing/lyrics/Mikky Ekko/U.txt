Well, well, well, well
Look at you, you, you, you

You tell me all the things you wanna do
Baby it's your body, let it choose
To love, love, love, to love

Still remember the first time that I saw your face
It was not love at first sight
The only reason I tell you that now
Is cause everything feels so right
With you lyin' next to me
And tellin' me your fantasies
Yeah everywhere we go it's so
So easy

You tell me all the things you wanna do
Baby it's your body, let it choose
To love, love, love, to love
Show me, what it means to take it slowly
Friendship into love takes growing
Knowing is to love, love, love, to love

Now you got me swimmin' in your ocean
And in your eyes I see devotion
And in my eyes you see a man hopin'
That you're not leavin' 'til the mornin'
So baby stay with me a little while longer
And know I beg, I plead to see you smile
No hesitatin', never keep you waitin'
But I will always take my time with...

You tell me all the things you wanna do
Baby it's your body, let it choose
To love, love, love, to love
Show me, what it means to take it slowly
Friendship into love takes growing
Knowing is to love, love, love, to love

Leads back to you
Give it all, give it all, give it all, for you
Give it all, give it all, give it all, for you
You're the only one I live for, try for
Weep for, die for, you know I'd give it all for

You tell me all the things you wanna do
Baby it's your body, let it choose
To love, love, love, to love
Show me, what it means to take it slowly
Friendship into love takes growing
