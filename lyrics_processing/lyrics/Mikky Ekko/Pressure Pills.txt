Wash it down, don't panic
Smoke cause you can't stop choking
And you think of the end
You think of the end
Heartbreak, heartache, apocalyptic art fake
I already know the ending
But where did the start
Take two of these blues and call me in the morning
It's a hard day, figured you would want a fair warning
Wake up from a deep sleep and
I can feel the sea creep in silence
Cold sweat, heart heaving, still hear mama crying
Whose lies you believe in, boy?
How does one person make a difference
Feels like a little kid asking for forgiveness
Wake up gifted, people say chosen
Came up in a cold world, people stay frozen so you
Keep your body moving, keep your body moving
Odds are against you, they tell me that we losing
Sanity in traction, cause and reaction
Nobody's waitin' for you

And you think of the end
You think of the end
Pressure pills, stress drink
Wash it down, don't panic
Smoke cause you can't stop choking
And you think of the end
You think of the end
But I don't wanna die this way
But maybe it's the price you pay
I don't wanna die this way
For a certain kind of life it's the price you pay
I've been living in the dark so long
Every spark goes on, and it's a fire that can light the way
Pressure pills, stress drink
Wash it down, don't panic
Smoke cause you can't stop choking
And you think of the end
You think of the end
Pressure pills, stress drink
Wash it down, don't panic
Smoke cause you can't stop choking
And you think of the end
