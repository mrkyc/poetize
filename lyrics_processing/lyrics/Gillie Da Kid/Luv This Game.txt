I love this game
All of the weed, pills, syrup and game
But it's time to let it go
Gotta let it go baby
I be lying if I say I wouldn't hustle
 I love this game
If I left it alone, I would never be the same
But I gotta let it go
But I be lying if I say I didn't love it

From the top to the bottom
Bottom back to the top
From a young no name, to selling them whole things
Man, I started with a squearl, stepped it up to 9
Got a line, goddambit now the world is mine
Told Poppy hand it off, Imma run it back
He handed it off, first month, I made a hundred flat
But with the money also come the friction
Niggas mad they can't hustle in my jurisdiction
Niggas mad, see me shining, man that jewlerey glissin
Fuck your racks,  convict him now
Gillie ahead of his time
Got bread on my mind
Got the feds on my line
Phone always ecko, but I don't talk 
Bitch I'm a veteran
Na, 
Up in the street,  chasing dope
Even though I know one day I gotta let it go
You might also like
I love this game
All of the weed, pills, syrup and game
But it's time to let it go
Gotta let it go baby
I be lying if I say I wouldn't hustle
 I love this game
If I left it alone, I would never be the same
But I gotta let it go
But I be lying if I say I didn't love it

Now I'm getting paper, money stack knee high
Everybody know my name, buzzing like a beehive
Police tryna trap me up, like T.I
Getting aproached by all the rats, in the C.I
See in Philly, these niggas shoot you dead and kill your mother
Get caught with  brother
 he undercover
Fucking sucker, daddy should've left you on the covers
It was all good just a week ago
Had the cars, had the women, had the cheepest blow
Now this nigga dropping lines
Straight dropping dimes, niggas swapping time
He was facing 20 years, only end up doing 2
Pussy look me in my eyes, tell me it isn't true
Damb, I'm in the streets chasing dope
But I know one day, I gotta let it go
I love this game
All of the weed, pills, syrup and game
But it's time to let it go
Gotta let it go baby
I be lying if I say I wouldn't hustle
 I love this game
If I left it alone, I would never be the same
But I gotta let it go
But I be lying if I say I didn't love it

Free!
This bitch got my heart hurting, I'm home sleep with my safe open
I'm knee deep in work, I love dope, but hate smokers
I ain't choking, I'm stressed out
Chain smoking, I need out
Fuck her, but don't eat her out
6 to 6, I'm weeded out
That drama, try to weed it out
Before we have to shoot it out
That bullshit, I can do without
My mama, had to move her out
For them bricks, try to retire
If they violate,  mollatov in they 
Nothing but a hater  I'm a hustler
So I was famous for I was famous, 
Speaking broke, nigga I ain't speaking your language
I'm speaking dope nigga, and your people old niggas
We stick to that G Code, we rep that east coast
Y'all just  wanna  peephole
We are locksmyths, we get those keys up in them keyholes
I got an undercover  I hate her but I love her 
I love this game
All of the weed, pills, syrup and game
But it's time to let it go
Gotta let it go baby
I be lying if I say I wouldn't hustle
 I love this game
If I left it alone, I would never be the same
But I gotta let it go
