And I can't remember last night, I sware this the life that I live
I been balling out with my niggas, I got love for all my niggas
And you know we on go, that's for everybody against us
We goin win, we goin win
We goin win, we goin win

I got money on my mind, got bad bitches on my line

They know whenever they see him
And you know I get them hoes

Talking model after model
Man they just wanna swallo my kids
Talking bottle after bottle
Man that's just how I motherfucking live
I'm talking fast money, fast cars
Bright ice, fast life
Lotta drugs, nigga lotta hoes
 remember last night
I passed out around 7
Woke back up around 11
Washed my face, and I brushed my teeth
Rolled some weed, got my  together, got something to eat
Put my  when I hit the streets
Cause this money don't ever sleep

Every day different city, different hoes
Every day, different nigga wife laying up in my sheets
And they know, so they don't 
But they still love them, so they gon cuff them
Man gotta let a ho be a ho, hope you don't suffer
 number 1 rule, put her in her place, or she gon carey on
I don't chase hoes, I chase money, nigga it's a marathon
I'm just tryna get to that green, I'm talking leprecon

Every time you niggas see the kid, he be fresh again
I don't even go out to the club, unless I get my weapon in
Time is money, I don't wanna talk unless 
I got money on my mind, I got bitches in my bed
And I can't remember last night, I sware this the life that I live
I been balling out with my niggas, I got love for all my niggas
And you know we on go, that's for everybody against us
We goin win, we goin win
We goin win, we goin win

We goin win
I been balling with my niggas, I got love for all of my niggas
And you know we on go, that's for everybody against us
