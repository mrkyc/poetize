Let me, let me begin
Let me begin with an I owe you
Who I owe everything to
Lately, lately my friend
Lately, you think I'm ignoring you
But I've been trying to pull through

All of the pain, I know you're looking down, down on me
I could have been someone
I hurt everyone
Pushed away everyone who got near

Tell me, something that I don't know
I couldn't let you go
Fell on my knees
Turned my face to the rain
That's when you heard my call
Sold me my stubborn soul
Phoenix is rising, it's rising again
Oo, oo, oo
Woah, oo, oo
Woah, oo, oo

Save me, save me again
Save me the way that you did before
Cause no one ever could have loved me more
Give me, give me the strength
Give me the strength when I need it more
Give me the reason that I'm looking for

I was a pain, they were looking down, down on me
I could have been someone
I hurt everyone
Pushed away everyone that was near

Tell me, something that I don't know
I couldn't let you go
Fell on my knees
Turned my face to the rain
That's when you heard my call
Sold me my stubborn soul
The phoenix is rising, it's rising again
Oo, oo, oo
Woah, oo, oo
Woah, oo, oo
Rising, woah, oo, oo
It's rising, woah, oo, oo
It's rising, woah, oo, oo
You took the pain
When my world caved down on me
Now I have someone
Cause you came and you showed me the world

Tell me, something that I don't know
I couldn't let you go (I couldn't let)
Fell on my knees (on my knees)
Turned my face to the rain
That's when you heard my call
Sold me my stubborn soul (you sold me my soul)
Phoenix is rising, it's rising again (phoenix is rising)
Tell me, something that I don't know
I couldn't let you go
Fell on my knees
Turned my face to the rain
That's when you heard my call
Sold me my stubborn soul
