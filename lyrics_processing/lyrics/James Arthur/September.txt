I remember when I met you, just before September
You were dancing in the street, rocking that pink and leather
Begged my friend for your number, I bet you don't remember
That's how we began
I pursued you for a year, I would have waited longer
I knew ultimately it would make the feeling stronger
That first time I kissed you, I could look in the mirror
And like who I was (I liked who I was)

I could never wait for the weekends when you would come over
'Cause that's when I'd see you again
You're all my strength and my weakness
You battle my demons
You're still undefeated

Sometimes I get a little bit jaded
Too much pressure just to make it (Ooh-woah)
You smile when I'm angry and I hate it (Ooh-woah)
But I'll still love you for the rest of my life
My crush on you has never faded
Let's go back to bed until we break it
I'm gonna love you for the rest of my life (My life, my life, my life)

Ooh
If you wanted to
I'd start a family with you

I remember being foolish when I met your mother
'Cause she had that Irish charm right then I knew I'd love her
That's where you got your heart
When we got back to the car
I knew you were the one (I knew I wanted you beside me)

I could never wait for the weekends when you would come over
'Cause that's when I'd see you again
You're all my strength and my weakness
You battle my demons
You're still undefeated

Sometimes I get a little bit jaded
Too much pressure just to make it
You smile when I'm angry and I hate it
But I'll still love you for the rest of my life
My crush on you has never faded
Let's go back to bed until we break it (My love, my love, won't break)
I'm gonna love you for the rest of my life
Ooh
