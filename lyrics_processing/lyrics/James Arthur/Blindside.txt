Summer ends, and Autumn starts all fading into one
But I know time left its scars
Never change, oh, my God
You were so caught up in your ways
You came for my cautious heart

Just like a bolt (Ooh-ooh)
From the blue (Ooh-ooh)
No one ever hit me harder than you

'Cause you caught me on my blindside
Right place at the wrong time
And I don't wanna love the ghost of you (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause you caught me on my blindside
You were once in a lifetime
Why do we love the ones that we lose?
I'm haunted by the ghost of you

You were good at talking back
So quick to use my past
All the questions you never asked
Maybe we drove it a little too fast
We broke apart at the seams
I just wish that we could go back

Just like a bolt from the blue
No one's ever hit me harder than you
Now it's all residue
You're just a memory I wake up to

'Cause you caught me on my blindside
Right place at the wrong time
And I don't wanna love the ghost of you (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause you caught me on my blindside
You were once in a lifetime
Why do we love the ones that we lose?
I'm haunted by the ghost of you
I'm haunted by the ghost of you

Every day, every night I'm falling
Every day, every night I'm falling
Every day, every night I'm falling

'Cause you caught me on my blindside
Right place at the wrong time
And I don't wanna love the ghost of you
'Cause you caught me on my blindside
You were once in a lifetime
Why do we love the ones that we lose?
I'm haunted by the ghost of you
