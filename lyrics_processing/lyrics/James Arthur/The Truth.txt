It was good to be there in the bright lights, oh
But I lost good friends under the spotlight, oh
Imagine if everybody knew your name
But they had nothing nice to say, nothing nice to say
It was good to be living up the high life, oh
But the comedown's harder in the headlines, oh
And everybody tells you, you should play the game
But there's only you to play, there's only you to play
Well I tried

I set fire to the glory
I set fire to the dream
I set fire to the only thing that lead me from the streets
Don't tell me it's over, 'cause I don't want to believe
'Cause now I've opened my eyes and I have found a way to breathe
The truth sets me free

I broke my back to make a breakthrough, oh
I lost my mind, look what it came to, oh
I had to lose it all so I could understand, oh
I was just a boy in the shadow of a man

I set fire to the glory
I set fire to the dream
I set fire to the only thing that lead me from the streets
Don't tell me it's over, 'cause I don't want to believe
'Cause now I've opened my eyes and I have found a way to breathe
The truth sets me free
Oh, the truth sets me free

'Cause now I've opened my eyes and I have found a way to breathe
