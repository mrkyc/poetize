Long gone we're falling down but I'm loving how it tastes
I look around for desire, love run away
Hold back, we're falling down, and I show you how it breaks
If I can give it, I'll take it, all of the way
And I've got a lot left to learn, babe

You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
It's hard times when nobody wants you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, we'll make it pop, honey
You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
It's a cold heart, when nobody holds you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, we'll make it pop, honey

The cold start coming down
I was way above the place
I wear it all for the day, now the day comes for me
When I look back we're falling down, you live with a break
You'd always give it, I take it, all the way
We've still got so much to learn, babe

You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
It's hard times when nobody wants you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, we'll make it pop, honey
You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
It's a cold heart, when nobody holds you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, we'll make it pop, honey

Don't you stop me
I will get what's coming to me
I am ready baby
I will be somebody
Don't you stop me
I will get what's coming to me
I am ready baby
I will be somebody

You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
It's hard times when nobody wants you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, we'll make it pop, honey
You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
It's a cold heart, when nobody holds you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
