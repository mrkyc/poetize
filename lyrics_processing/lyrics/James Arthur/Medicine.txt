Always made me feel blessed, you're my guardian angel

You kiss away the pain of all the hell I'm in
You're gonna make me better than I've ever been
'Cause you're my medicine, yeah, you're my medicine
You make my heart beat faster than adrenaline
You take the pain whenever I'm in hell again
I know you'll make me better than I've ever been
'Cause you're my medicine, yeah, you're my medicine
