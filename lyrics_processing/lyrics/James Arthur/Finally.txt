This is all I ever wanted
All I ever thought I'd be
It's the only place I truly feel
As though I can be me

But the way I arrived
It was overnight
I've been on my worst behaviour
Been on my worst behaviour

If only it ain't been like this
Now I can hold my heart in a fist
And all the voices leave
I can finally put it on my sleeve
Oh, if only they'd really seen it
Maybe they would finally believe me
When I say I've won
And my father gets to see his son
That he can feel proud of
He can feel proud of
He's proud of me

This is all I ever wanted
All I ever thought I'd be
But the way that I behaved
Could have seen quite the contrary

I felt all the lives
They're out of sight
I've been on my worst behaviour
Been on my worst behaviour

If only I ain't been like this
Now I can hold my heart in a fist
And all the voices leave
I can finally put it on my sleeve
Oh, if only they'd really seen it
Maybe they would finally believe me
When I say I've won
And my mother gets to see her son
That she can feel proud of
She can feel proud of
She's proud of me

She's proud of me
They're proud of me
They're proud of me
They're proud of me
She's proud of me
She's proud of
She's proud of
They're proud of
They're proud of
They're proud of me
They're proud of me
They're proud of me
She's proud of
They're proud of
If only I ain't been like this
Now I can hold my heart in a fist
And all the voices leave
I can finally put it on my sleeve
Oh, if only they had really seen it
Then maybe they would finally believe me
When I say I've won
And my family gets to see their
That they can feel proud of
They can feel proud of
They can feel proud of
