This hidden thing
That you don't see
They call them skeletons
But don't be scared of them
'Cause you're still you
And I'm still me
It's all irrelevant
We all got skeletons

You could tell me everything
And then we could forget it
Baby, you could show me all your demons in a minute
It could be a battle
When the words come back around, around
We don't ever got to tell a lie
And then relive it
I could show you demons
Only you could take a minute
Show me that you'll be there
When the walls come crashing down

When you're holding back the words
'Cause you're afraid of being hurt
Just let love in
Just let love in
Oh, we're only skin and bone
We don't have to be alone
Just let love in
Just let love in
I just let love in
Just let love in

Sink or swim
What will it be?
We all got skeletons
Set them free
But now I'm over it
And I'm under you
So tell me everything
Take a trip to the moon

Oh, when you're holding back the words
'Cause you're afraid of being hurt
Just let love in
Just let love in
Oh, we're only skin and bone
We don't have to be alone
Just let love in
Just let love in
I just let love in
Just let love in

You could tell me everything
And then we could forget it
Baby, you could show me all your demons in a minute
It could be a battle
When the words come back around, around
We don't ever got to tell a lie
And then relive it
I could show you demons
Only you could take a minute
Tell me that you'll be there
When the walls come crashing down, down
Oh, when you're holding back the words
'cause you're afraid of being hurt
Just let love in
Just let love in
Oh, we're only skin and bone
We don't have to be alone
Just let love in
Just let love in
I just let love in
Just let love in
I just let love in
