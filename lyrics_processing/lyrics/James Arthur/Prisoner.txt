If I'm underneath the table
Then pour me another drink
Oh, I don't want to remember
I don't even want to think
I'm a slave to my addiction
I'm a hazard to myself
On a fast track to perdition
Oh, I'm heading straight to hell

When I throw up out your window
You should confiscate my key
I will drive you up the fucking wall
Is it too late to believe

I tried so hard to change
But the devil locked my door
I wear these heavy chains around my neck
Like a prisoner
I just want to love
But he won't let me go
Loosen up my chains
Or I'm a condemned prisoner

I was stood there in the spotlight
With this city at my feet
But I was a dead man walking
Nothing ever comes for free
So I moved on down to London
Where I traded in my soul
I could not fill my heart
With all those one night stands and gold

So throw me out your mom's house
I've been living there too long
Well she never liked me anyway
Cause she knows I'm northern scum

I tried so hard to change
But the devil locked my door
I wear these heavy chains around my neck
Like a prisoner
I just wanna love
But he won't let me go
Loosen up my chains
Or I'm a condemned prisoner
I think my minds on the blink
So I get high, so high and I drink
I suffered enough of the heart palps when I think
Discovered it up at the bar 9 drinks in
Now I'm at the disco, convinced the girls think I'm the bizzo
Course I'm on the brink
Looking at me funny then course I'm gonna swing
Karaoke? Course I wanna sing
Or pour me another drink
It always ends the same
Or I'm a condemned prisoner

I tried so hard to change
But the devil locked my door
I wear these heavy chains around my neck
Like a prisoner
I just wanna love
But he won't let me go
Loosen up my chains
