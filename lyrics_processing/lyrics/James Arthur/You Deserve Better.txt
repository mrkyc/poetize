I'm just not sure my heart is working
And yours is beating double time
Deep down you know I ain't even worth it
It's not enough, babe, all I do is make you cry

Like ooh-ahh, ooh-ahh
I know I do this every time
Like ooh-ahh, I know
That I just got to say what's on my mind

You deserve better, better, better than me
Might be what you want, but I'm not what you need
You're better, better than you even realise
You deserve better, better, better than me
Might be what you want, but I want you to see
You're better off without me in your life

And I hope you'll find somebody else
That'll love you like nobody else
And I hope he gives you something real, oh, I love you still
But you deserve better, better, better, better

Give up on me, 'cause, babe, I'm hopeless
The more it hurts, the more you try
You know I loved, I just never showed it
It'll be too late when you're with some other guy

Like ooh-ahh, ooh-ahh
I know I do this every time
Like ooh-ahh, I know
That I just got to say what's on my mind

You deserve better, better, better than me
Might be what you want, but I'm not what you need
You're better, better than you even realise
You deserve better, better, better than me
Might be what you want, but I want you to see
You're better off without me in your life

And I hope you'll find somebody else
That'll love you like nobody else
And I hope he gives you something real, oh, I love you still
But you deserve better, better, better, better
Might be what you want, but not what you need
Baby, oh yeah

You deserve better, better, better than me
Might be what you want, but I'm not what you need
You're better, better than you even realise
You deserve better, better, better than me
Might be what you want, but I want you to see
You're better off without me in your life

And I hope you'll find somebody else
That'll love you like nobody else
And I hope he gives you something real, oh, I love you still
