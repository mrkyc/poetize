It's a long night in a big crowd
Under these lights lookin' 'round for you, uh
Yeah, I'm steppin' outside under moonlight
To get my head right, lookin' out for you, uh

Could it be your eyes? Didn't know that I've been
Waitin', waitin' for you
When you're by my side, everything's alright
Crazy, I'm crazy for you

Oh, here I go, down that road
Again and again, the fool rushin' in
But I can't help when I feel some kind of way
Do you feel the same?

'Cause
I'll fall, I'll fall for you
You caught me at my weakest
And I'll fall for you

Yeah, it's a long night in a big crowd
Under these lights lookin' 'round for you, mmm
Oh, you give me hope, right reason, desire livin' this life
Only now for you, oh, for you
