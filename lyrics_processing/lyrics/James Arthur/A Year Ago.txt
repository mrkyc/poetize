I miss you
Your name's still on my coffee cup
I miss you
The way you chose the films we watched
I miss you, babe
If only I had told you that before
Maybe I would never have to miss you
Singing by the kitchen sink
I miss you
Not knowing I was listening
I miss you, babe
You embody everything that I am not
And, now, I'm just somebody you forgot

I wish it was a year ago
I wish that I could hold you close
Now I'm driving past your house, I know
The lights are on, you're not alone
I wonder if you're making eyes
I wonder if he loves you like
The way you said that only I could do
I wish that I could tell you that I miss you

I miss you
The way you left my car a mess
I miss you
The way you took up half the bed
That empty space
You remind me of the things that I am not
And, now, I'm just somebody you forgot

I wish it was a year ago
I wish that I could hold you close
Now I'm driving past your house, I know
The lights are on, you're not alone
I wonder if you're making eyes
I wonder if he loves you like
The way you said that only I could do
I wish that I could tell you that I miss you, oh-ohh
I wish that I could tell you that I miss you, oh, I-I-I-I

I wish it was a year ago
I wish that I could hold you close
The way you said that only I could do
