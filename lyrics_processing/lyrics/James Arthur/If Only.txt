I still remember my name
But forgotten my royal mistakes
If only
I could go back in time
When you were a friend of mine
If only
We were just a little less tired and true
You were being you, and I was being too human
But who was I fooling
Ohh if only

If only I could trust you'd
Rest your head and turn the light on
If only I could wish your kiss was not a falling star
If only I was yours, the shoulder that you'd wanna to cry on
If only you could pull me safely through these prison bars
Ehh if only
(If only, if only)
(If only, if only)

I took your crown of thorns
Laid down to be reborn
If only
I wasn't flesh and bone
I could rise up from being stoned
If only

Tryna be free, maybe just a little less lonely
Ohh I was so lonely
If only

If only I could trust you'd
Rest your head and turn the light on (If only, if only)
If only I could wish your kiss was not a falling star
(If only, if only)
If only I was yours, the shoulder that you'd wanna to cry on
(If only, if only)
If only you could pull me safely through these prison bars
(If only)
Ehh if only

It's out with the old, I'll be new
And don't worry about the drink and drugs, I am through
If only I believed that was true
We'd be living all the dreams in a house with a view
If only, if only you knew how the voices of demons could drown out the truth
Now my one place of freedom is sleeping with you
If only, if only you knew

If only I could trust you'd
Rest your head and turn the light on
If only I could wish your kiss was not a falling star
If only, If only I was your shoulder to cry on
If only you could pull me safely through these prison bars
Ehh if only
If only, if only
