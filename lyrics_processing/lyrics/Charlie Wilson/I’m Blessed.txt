I knew God was, was with me
I always use to pray, ah
My prayer was I asked God to not to let the devil kill me out here
While I was in the streets before I could get back
But I said if you give me one more chance at life and music
I promise you I'm gon' shout you out
And I'm gon' testify
And we gon' have a little church up in there
Oh, oh, oh, I'm blessed

Wakin' up, thankin' God
Every day is feelin' just like Sunday
Wifey fly, by my side
Green light, everything is going my way
Ridin' clean, livin' dreams
Just left the barber and I'm feelin' like Midas
Heard him say, give Him praise
What's in the water gotcha actin' like this

Ain't a day go by, that I don't try
To thank the Lord up above
And if you wonder why I'm lovin' life
Come close and I'll tell you what's up (Listen)

(Yeah, Lemme holla at 'em Uncle Charlie, Yeah)
Thank God for anotha day
While they were hatin' on me
He done found another way
I know that trouble all around
Tryna tear us all down
But I got to thank God for every day above ground
(Every day above ground a good day, man)
I know the devil workin' day and night (So?)
But I look him in the eyes, say you a damn liar (You lyin')
And I know I coulda died in the night time
I'm still around because of His work not because of mine
And now my partner doing time got a message for you (Free Meech)
Might be stressin' out but there's a blessing comin'
And what it do through all the partyin' and nonsense
Just take some time to thank God for what he done
When the partner you run with
Come with the negative comments
Tryna to get you do something
You better not follow them damners
I swear, I declare
So much power in prayer
You have no idea
God is always here
I'm blessed

Living every moment, no regrets
Smile up on my face, I'm like oh
Yes, I'm blessed, yes, I'm blessed, yes
Ask me how I'm doing, I'm blessed, yes
Living every moment no regrets
Smile up on my face, I'm like oh
