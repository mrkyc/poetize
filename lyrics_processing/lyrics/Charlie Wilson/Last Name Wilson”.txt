With all of this fortoune, what am i doin single
Sometimes i tell my self, "Man get out and mingle"
You don't have to be alone, you ned someone to love
But bein' famouse sometimes it's hard to find someone to trust
But the hell with that this time, i'm gonna treat myself
Being in love is good for your health
Its time to share this fortune and fame with someone else
Mow that im in this club, i might as well, yeah
