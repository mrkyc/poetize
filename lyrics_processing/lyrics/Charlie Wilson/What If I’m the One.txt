VERSE 1:
What if you thought too much and missed out on your blessings girl?
What if you had your chance and you let it pass?
What if you lived your whole life and your heart never knew what it felt like to be loved, loved?
Could you deal with it? Could you live with yourself if you made a decision that was all wrong?
And I was long gone? And what if you were blind and couldn't see that it was me?
CHORUS:
What if I'm the one to wife you like you're supposed to be?
What if I'm the one to cop you that ten carat ring?
What if it's me that's supposed to be with you baby?
Forever would be better if I was just with you
VERSE 2:
What if I'm the one you should be making babies with?
I know you're the one cause I don't mind you spending all my chips
What if it's me that's supposed to be with you baby?
Forever would be better
I'm the one for you
Just think what if you had someone who unconditionally loved you girl
And you slipped on him and let him pass
What if God gave you what you prayed for but you didn't receive it
Cause you didn't believe it
What if you never had no one to make love with all in the kitchen
And you missed him
What if had the house, and a car, and the kids, and the dog?
What if everything you wanted, you could have it all

BRIDGE:
And baby right now is the time for you to make up your mind
Cause tomorrow's not promised to nobody
And baby I'm convinced, it's no coincidence
Girl let me be the one to make your name Mrs. Wilson
If you want it, you can have it, come and get it
Girl let me be the one to break you off and get your head sprung
If you want it, you can have it, come and get it
Girl let me be the one to lay you down and get you naked
If you want it, you can have it, come and get it
Baby girl don't make me wait no more I just can't take it
