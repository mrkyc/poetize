My name Uncle Charlie, how you doin'? where you goin'?
Baby where's your rush, can I take a
A little moment of your time Mrs. Purpose
Couldn't meet you mind, you were hurtin'
The tears in your eyes, to my surprise ain't got a word to say
Then she walked away, I didn't give a name

All these others don't comparin
Baby I need your name
'Cause I won't be home without you dear
Baby it's cold in here
You just know you can complete me dear
All white with a picket fence
By now, by now

Us, us, us trust

Us, us, us trust

Us, us, us trust
There's supposed to be us babe
By now, by now
