In fact it's just the opposite of all of the words that come from you
And sometimes I sit around waiting you say you'll come but you never show
That's not the way you treat your woman
The promises you make, you don't keep
Instead you go and do the very thing you know that hurts me
What I'm trying to get you to see is that your better half has needs
You don't have to say a word to me baby just
Show me, you love me, and you won't have to say a word
Just show me, you love me, and you won't have to say a word
I don't wanna let you go, breaking up would be upsurd
If you just show me you love me, then you don't have to say a word
Like sometimes you say you right, but you'll be wrong
And still I take the blame, tuck all my pain
Cause I don't wanna argue all night long
Oh I toss and turn through the night
The morning comes and you're still not by my side
That's not the way you treat your woman
Said you would be faithful, but I can't tell
In fact you show me things that lets me know, that your heart is somewhere else
What I'm trying to get you to see is that your better half has needs
You don't have to say one word to me baby just

Hey just show me that you love me

Hey she said all you gotta do is pick up the phone and call me sometimes
She said take me to the club with you sometime
Can you take me out to dinner with you sometime?
Send me a bouquet of flowers sometime
Get up off your lazy ass and go to work sometimes
Cancel hanging out with your boys and stay in with me sometimes
I'm your woman, act like it sometimes
All I ask is that you take care of business sometimes
Can you take the trash out for me sometimes
