Hello, do you have a minute?
I noticed you from across the room
Excuse me miss, don't take this wrong
I couldn't resist that smile and those beautiful eyes
I can see that you're wearing fancy clothes and drive a fancy car
Your hair did and your nails done, looking like a superstar
Can I take out to dinner, baby?
Cause there's something that I wanna say to you

My love is all I have (All I have)
I have to give (I have to give), I have to give
My love is all I have (All I have baby)
I have to give (Oh), I have to give to you (Oh oh oh yeah)

I may not have a bank account with seven figures
And I may not have a sailboat and a big old mansion, oh no
But I do know how to love you, baby
And in my own way, in my own way, I'm rich as hell
I really hope that none of this don't matter
And I hope that you don't judge a man by his status
And I was wondering if you and I can get together, know each other better
And I promise you I'll give my all and make my heart your mansion

Girl, you'll see what it is, I'm just keeping it real
It's real, it's real

My love is all I have (All I have)
I have to give (I have to give), I have to give
My love is all I have (Oh yeah)
I have to give, I have to give
My love is all I have
I have to give, I have to give
My love is all I have
