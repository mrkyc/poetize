I can't let go, I can't let go
Ohh yeahh, yeahh

Baby sit down, I've got something I wanna say to you
Let your guard down, I wanna get through to you
You got that love I never knew
Until you came in my life, ...
Don't say a word until I finish, baby
I ain't gone stop, I'm going in, baby
Until I will make you see, I will never leave

Don't you know, know other woman can do me like you do
You got that something, that keeps me coming through
If ever want you, the sexy way you move
Just makes me stop and say
And that's why I ain't going nowhere

Ohh, I can't let go
Baby you got what I need, you got what I need
And I got what you want, oh baby
Ohhh, baby, I can't let go
This is coming from my heart, you need to know
That I just can't let you go
That I just can't let you go

You know you got that thing
And when I did it baby
You make for sure I don't forget it baby
Is that damn good, I want to give it to you every night, every night
You call my name and I go running to you
Fortune and fame, I give it up for you
Cause it won't be the same
If you're understanding my name

Ohh, I can't let go
Baby you got what I need, you got what I need
And I got what you want, oh baby
Ohhh baby, I can't let go
This is coming from my heart, you need to know
That I just can't let you go

Baby loving you just keeps me in the zone
If I can't have, hey I'd rather be alone
There's a million stars but you're the only one that brightens my world you're my soul

Baby you got what I need, you got what I need
And I got what you want, oh baby
Ohhh baby, I can't let go
This is coming from my heart, you need to know
That I just can't let you go
I can't let go, I can't let go
I can't let go, I can't let go
I can't let go, I can't let go
