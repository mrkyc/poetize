Tonight your in for a special treat
I bought you roses just to sweep of your feet (Ohh)
There'll be plenty of times for us to make love
But how about first we celebrate what's up
How is this sound
The city is ours
Let's take it down town
To your favorite spot
Don't try to hide your smile
Let's go all out
The way we always do when were together
Don't waste no time let's go
Now girl

Put on the dancing shoes tonight
Slip on the dress, no one alike
All eyes on us cause we are the life of the party baby (Yeah)
Sip a little something to break the ice
Glass in the air, we're feeling nice
With you on the dance floor we're the life of the party baby (Yeah yeah)

Girl, the way we move
Nobody does it better
And under the moon and stars
I could sing like this forever
With you girl
When the DJ is playing our song
We gotta get up
And show them how it's done
