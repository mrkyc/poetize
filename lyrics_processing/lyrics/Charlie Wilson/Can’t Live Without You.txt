I can't live without ya, I can't live without ya
Ooh woah

Girl you got me shook
After all the fightin' and the screams
Snatched up ya keys then ya got in the Range
Knowing that it's rainin', why'd I let you go?
I don't know how long it took
But I know that I drove all around
Tryna calm down, you wouldn't answer my calls
Now I'm scared girl, where'd ya go?

Damn girl, why'd ya leave like that?
Whatever I said I didn't mean it like that
How do ya expect from me not to fight back
When you scream like that
Girl I love you more than that
When a night at the club or a hit off a blunt
I love you more than that
And a smile and a bud
'Cause you're all that I want

I can't forgive myself if I hurt you girl, what do I do?
I can't live without ya, I can't live without ya girl
And girl it break my heart
If I broke your heart, what do I do?
I can't live without ya girl, I can't live without ya
Baby I don't care if I'm wrong or right
If I could just love you tonight
I can't forgive myself if I hurt you girl, what do I do?
I can't live without ya, I can't live without ya girl

Wish I could tell you how I feel
Everythin' that I'm workin' for is yours
How could I ignore when I wanna be yours?
But I slam the door right on our love
What kind of man don't understand
The difference between a penny and a dime
Musta lost my mind you and me were on the grind
Once upon a time, why'd I let you go?

Damn girl, why'd ya leave like that?
Whatever I said I didn't mean it like that
