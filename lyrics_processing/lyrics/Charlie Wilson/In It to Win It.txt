I was born in Oklahoma, thought in Oklahoma
When I was a little boy I used to sing before my father preached
I wanted to love on everybody, hug on everybody and smile
But you know it was a time when there was still segregation and a lot of racism
You know here people called me names like lil' nigga boy and all that
When I got to college, I'll never forget, one of my professors told me
That I was goin' to be nothing in life and imma end up in an ally
And I kinda ended up like that way, at least for a while
'Cause I did end up on the streets at one point in my life doin' drugs and alcohol

My story started, eh
Such a long time ago
Bruise up and scarred
Sometimes that seems impossible
Some said I was unable, yeah
I think they was afraid of what I can do

I never stopped believin', ah
I'm gonna see it all the way through, oh no
Don't tell me that I didn't want ya (Oh yeah)
But Kobe in the fourth quarter (Quarter)
Didn't know until it's over (Over)
But I'm not backing down

You know it's been a, it's a roller coaster ride for me but I'm having fun in my life and you know I learned one thing
My blessings come from God, my life has already been mapped out by God
So this is why I'm still here
I'm not going anywhere
I'm not quitting, I'm standing up
I'm standing tall, I'm goin' forward
