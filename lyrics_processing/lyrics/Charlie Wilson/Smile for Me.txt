Alright, yeah

I think about what my daddy told me, umm
There's gonna be storms in life, yes it will
But the sun comes up every morning, umm
Even after the darkest night, yeah

Maybe the rent ain't paid
Or the car note's late
And you're working hard
Like every single day, yeah
But you can make it through
Ain't nothing you can't do
Yeah, I believe in you
Let me break it down

I'm here to say
When everything ain't okay
I promise it's gonna change
So won't you smile for me
I know it's hard (I know it's hard)
'Cause I've been right where you are
You can light up the dark
If you just smile for me
