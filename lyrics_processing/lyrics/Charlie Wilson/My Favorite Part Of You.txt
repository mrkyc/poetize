Ooohhh.. Oh Baby! Oohh..
Ooohhh.. Girl, Yeah!

Baby, you're flawless, girl from your head to your feet
You outshine the diamond that's on your ring
You're just like a flower, every petal unique
But what's at the top of the list for me?

Could be your lips or your beautiful curves
Girl, I swear you're so damn sexy it hurts
I gotta tell ya, baby
It's your mind and your body, hold up
I'm not done
There's no way that I can choose just one
You're more than any man deserves

Oh, so many things that I like
I can't decide because every part of you is
My favorite part of you, oh!
No matter how hard I try
I can't decide because every part of you is
My favorite part of you, oh!
