Oh, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, beggin', beggin'

Hello, I'm standin' out here at the front door
Hello, can you hear me? I'm at the front door
And my key ain't workin', where you at? Let me in
You ain't comin' in here
What the hell you mean I can't come in?
Oh no, I know she just didn't hang up what she thinkin'?
Oh no, here we go, I'm 'bout to kick this door in
I hear the po po comin' see my clothes out the window
She put me out and I ain't got nowhere else to go

Your heart's my house, it's where I sleep
Without my baby a bum is what I'd be
What am I gonna do if you ain't there to come home to?
Girl I'm gon' be out on the streets if I ain't with you

You may see me on the corner of the streets
Standin' with a cup in my hand holdin' a sign up
Sayin' that I'm homeless, I'm homeless, girl I'm homeless
And I'm beggin', I'm beggin'

Girl damn I'm really missin' how you used to drop it
My food all it tastes like it came straight out the garbage
And the girls I'm meetin' they be garbage
