I've seen the beauty of the earth
With my own eyes, yes for all it's worth
There's something more, I was about here for
I knew from the first moment, that I saw you, oh yes
I've heard a million melodies
And my heart knows, all the joy they breathe
But there's so much more, my heart's made for
And I feel it every time, that I'm close to you

My heart was made to hold you close forever
My arms won't let you go, so come whatever
We, we were made just for us
'Cause you and me, we were made for love
Just you and me

And here I stand, walking up and wanting nothing more
And for you to hold my hand, and let me hold yours
And together make us a world, for we are here before, my baby
Makin' love, that's for sure
Made to last forever more

My heart was made to hold you close forever
My arms won't let you go, so come whatever
We, we were made just for us
'Cause you and me, we were made for love
Just you and me
You and me, yeah
You and me, na-na-na-na
We were made just for us
Ooh we know it we were made for love
