Lately I've been thinkin' 'bout us
What would I be if I hadn't met you?
And the truth is, I don't think that I'd be well
And every day, I get to wake up
Next to you, girl, I'm reminded of
All the reasons I'm so happy I could yell

Screamin' out at the top of my lungs
Tell the world that I found the one
My baby's hotter than the golden Sun
You make my heart beat like a bass drum

Listen to me now
I've been touched by an angel
You're what Heaven is made of
Can't see your wings, or a halo
Saved my life so you gotta be a miracle
I've been touched, touched by an angel

When I'm lookin' into your eyes
Forget about my problems, I'm in paradise
I'm alright as long as you're by my side
You're my best friend, my lover, my rock
Wanna climb to the highest mountaintop
And confess my love for you will never die

Listen to me now
I've been touched by an angel
You're what Heaven is made of
Can't see your wings, or a halo
Saved my life so you gotta be a miracle
I've been touched, touched by an angel

See you're my angel, guardian angel
And I owe, I owe my life to you
You're my angel, guardian angel
And I owe, I owe my life, my heart, my world to you

Listen to me now
I've been touched by an angel
You're what Heaven is made of
Can't see your wings, or a halo
Saved my life so you gotta be a miracle
