Butterflies is what I feel inside
And every time it's like my first time, ooh wee
And I can never find the words to say
You're the perfect girl, you were made for me
It's so easy to love you, baby
We're compatible, incredible and natural, we are
And girl I've never felt this way before
From the bottom of my heart
Baby girl, I just wanna tell you that you are

The reason I love, the reason I trust
God sent me an angel, you are
The best in the world, a wonderful girl
Knowing you're by my side brings tears to my eyes, baby

Girl, you had me from the moment I looked into your eyes
And I knew you were an angel, but you were in disguise
Tell me how could I be so lucky that you'd fall down from heaven for me, ooh baby
Some people search a lifetime and never find a true love, ooh wee
But Heaven cared enough for me to give me you
And now our hearts can beat together
Standing strong girl here forever
You and I (You and I)
You and I (You and I)
I just want you to know, you are

The reason I love, the reason I trust
God sent me an angel, you are
The best in the world, a wonderful girl
Knowing you're by my side, and a man ain't supposed to cry

But girl, you are
The only woman I'll make love to (You are)
The reason I come home every night (Girl, you are)
You're all that I need in my life
It almost feels it's not fair
Loving you, I don't care
You are (You are)
You are (You are)

You're the reason I love, the reason I trust
God sent me an angel, you are
The best in the world, a wonderful girl (You're a wonderful girl)
Oh, oh-oh, you are
(Baby, you are) You're all that I am
(You are) You're all that I need
(You are) Baby, heaven has sent you to me
(Baby, you are) The one for me
(You are) The air that I breathe
(You are) Baby, you are, you are
You are, you are everything to me, baby
You're everything, oh baby
