God, you're amazing
Thank you for my life
For all of your blessings
And for watching over us

Mountains high, oceans wide
Sunny days and starry nights
Amazing you are
Birds up high, spread wings and fly
Just to thank you for the skies
Beautiful you are

As the rainbow raises all its colors to you
We raise our hands of all colors too

What an amazing God, you are
Let all the world choose to see
That you're an amazing God, yes you are
And the moment we look to you, we can see
What an amazing life to each of us, you bring

Spinning world, moving fast
City lights and angels pass
And still amazing you are
My stomy past will not last
The hope, the dreams, the peace I had
Because marvelous you are
