You saw me at the Mall just the other day
Holding bags for my girl so you looked away
She don't mean a thing to me anyway
And I'd still be with you if I had my way
The bed was so cold where you used to lay
I got weak late one night so I let her stay
But I found out that no one can take your place
Cause ill still be callin' your name

I know it seems, I'm givin' her time
She don't have, a part of my mind
'Cause everything's , still all about you
She just takin' up space till you come back my way
The kissing's good the sex is alright
But she ain't you, so it don't feel right
'Cause everything's still all about you
She's just takin' up space, till you come back my way

I thought I could move on, never lookin' back
Till I saw stumbled upon an old picture that
Bought back the old jokes that I used to have
When I sill had you everything was kool
Now I'm feelin so bad about rushin it
From hello to my bed, still its you I miss
Can't pretend any more than I'm down with this
I'm letting go to be with you

I know it seems, I'm givin' her time
She don't have, a part of my mind
'Cause everything's , still all about you
She just takin' up space till you come back my way
The kissing's good the sex is alright
But she ain't you, so it don't feel right
'Cause everything's still all about you
She's just takin' up space, till you come back my way

When in the middle of the making love
I'm holding her close, but I feel your touch
Your in my head, but I want you right here in my bed
Come back, come back

I know it seems, I'm givin' her time
She don't have, a part of my mind
'Cause everything's , still all about you
She just takin' up space till you come back my way
The kissing's good the sex is alright
But she ain't you, so it don't feel right
'Cause everything's still all about you
She's just takin' up space, till you come back my way
I know it seems, I'm givin' her time
She don't have, a part of my mind
'Cause everything's , still all about you
