Ain't no coffee strong enough to get me through my day
One thing to another, there's no time to stop
I hit the ground a runnin' and keep runnin' 'til I drop
I'm taking care of everyone, oh, my heads in a spin
I tried but I just don't remember signing up for this
Before I leave the house, I pack a diaper bag with clothes and snacks
Laptop, cell phone, find my keys, feed the dogs before I leave
Everybody's needs are my responsibility
It sure'd be nice to have somebody taking care of me, yeah
Why, why, why, why?
When I'm through with this life
I am gonna have a come to Jesus
You can guarantee
When I walk through those pearly gates
I am gonna have a talk with Eve
There's so many things that I can't begin to understand
The differences that are between a woman and a man
See woman they do twice the work and get half the pay
Men they climb the ladder while the women pave the way
They say we are the weaker sex, I'd have to disagree
I'd walk a mile in his shoes if he'd walk a half a mile in these

Botox, peels, exfoliate, we have the babies, lose the weight
Laundry, dishes, up all night, I try my best to get it right
Husband, kids, work all day, I got PMS and PTA
Find the thing my kid can't find, I need a drink but there's no time
So many things I have on my list
No wonder why at times
Oh I can seem like such a witch
Why, why, why, why?
When I'm through with this life
I am gonna have a come to Jesus
You can guarantee
When I walk through those pearly gates
I am gonna have a talk with Eve
