Growin' up livin' in my own little world
So it seemed, I had my dolls and dreams
Momma was always there to comfort me
Give me love, there wasn't nothin' quite like it
In the world, that I knew of
Before I knew it I was standin' in my teens
Sweet little boy with his strong young arms holdin' me
I remember the first time I felt his kiss
Oh, it like to drove me crazy
And I remember sayin' I never felt nothin' like this
So I went and asked momma, "can you tell me what it means?"
She said "you're in love and that's every little girl's dream"
Baby what you found is every little girl's dream
So I said, "Momma does love ever last?"
She says, "worry about now and let the future come to pass"
Just understand and enjoy what you've found
And listen to it as long is your heart is asound
Love, there ain't nothin' quite like it
In the world, anybody knows of
So there I was all through my teens
Same little boy with his strong young arms lovin' me
You might also likeI remember the first time I felt his kiss
Oh, it like to drove me crazy
And I remember sayin' I never felt nothin' like this
I remember sayin' to momma, "I know just what you mean"
I'm in love and that's every little girl's dream
Oh, what I found is every little girl's dream
Now I found mine and momma says, "me too baby once upon a time"
It lifts you up but it lets you down
There'll be another dream to bring you back around
There's somethin' about the first time that keeps you rememberin'
When you found every little girl's dream
Every little girl's dream
I found every little girl's dream
Every little girl's dream
