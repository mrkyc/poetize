Mm

I wake up to the sunshine out my window
And the passin' sound of a homeless man
Singin' an old Cole Porter song
The faucet leaks, the TV's on the blink again
But my resless dreams are still intact
Even though it's takin' way too long

I got a hundred dollars in the Coke tin on my shelf
And I've been thinkin' to myself, woah-oh

These are the days you will remember
For the rest of your life
These are the memories you'll pack in a box
And you pull out sometimes
So pick your flowers, count the seconds, roll the dice
But, baby, don't wait 'til it's too late
Put a smile on your face
These are the days

Outside, the people rush to get ahead
For checks and promotions and fancy cars
Happiness is just around the bend
But old Mrs. Jones sits out and suns her face
And as I walk by, I can hear her say
"This is as good as it gets"

Well, there goes the business suit who owns this whole damn lot
His roller coaster never stops
Oh, I wanna say to him

These are the days you will remember
For the rest of your life
These are the memories you'll pack in a box
And you pull out sometimes
So pick your flowers, count the seconds, roll the dice
And, baby, don't wait until it's too late
Put a smile on your face
These are the days

Oh yeah
So pick your flowers, count the seconds, roll the dice
Oh, and don't wait until it's too late
Put a smile on your face
'Cause these are the days
Yeah, these are the days

These are the days, hey
These are the days
Oh, don't you know
(These are the days) Oh yeah
These are the days (These are the days)
Don't you know it all?
Oh yeah (These are the days)
Oh yeah, these are the days (These are the days)
Oh yeah, you know it is
Oh yeah (These are the days)
