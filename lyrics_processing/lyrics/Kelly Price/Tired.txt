There's a hole in my heart
My soul is bleeding
I need to free my mind
And say what I'm feeling
'Cause Lord knows
Lord knows that

(I'm tired) Tired of the way he treats me
(Tired) Tired of the guilty feelings
(Tired) Tired of the broken dreams, I'm
(Tired) Tired of the public scenes, I'm
(Tired) Tired of the baby mama
(Tired) Tired of the ghetto drama
(Tired) Tired of the back and forth, I'm
(Tired) Tired of in and out the courts

(I'm tired) I'm tired of all the games and lies, I'm
(Tired) Tired of phony alibis, I'm
(Tired) Tired of praying that it works, I'm
(Tired) Even tired of going to church, I'm
(Tired) Tired of paying these bills, I
(Tired) Said I'm tired of keeping it real and
(Tired) I'm tired of crying
(Tired) And I'm tired of smiling

(I'm tired) I'm tired of all the haters and
(Tired) I'm tired of all the players, I'm
(Tired) So tired of the games, I'm so tired
(Tired) 'Cause it's about to drive me insane
(Tired) And oh, I'm so tired of taking it
(Tired) Said yeah, I'm so tired of faking it
(Tired) 'Cause you don't do it for me no more
(Tired) You just don't do it no more

(I'm tired) I'm tired of being wronged and doing right
(Tired) Said I'm tired of keeping peace in times of fighting
(Tired) Tired of letting go then holding on
(Tired) I'm tired of feeling weak and being strong
(Tired) So let me hear you if you're tired
(Tired) Gotta make some noise if you're tired
(Tired) Oh, throw 'em up if you're tired
(Tired) Now wave your hands if you're tired

Yeah-eah, yeah-eah
Whoa (Let it out, let it out, scream and shout, scream and shout)
Whoa, yeah
So, let it go
