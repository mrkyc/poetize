And we slept the night away
It happened
Now we can't turn back the hands of time, oh no, no
Yes, we've stolen this moment
We forgot to face one simple fact
We both belong to someone else
As we slept the night away
It's morning
Sunlight shines across your sleeping face, oh-oh, oh
A new day
Brings reality and we must go our separate ways
What a lovely night we had, yeah, yeah, yeah
As we shared each other's love
We forgot about all the pain we caused
As we slept the night away
As we lay
We forgot about tomorrow
As we lay
Ooh, hey, hey
As we lay
Didn't think about the price we'd have to pay
No, no, no-no-no-no-no-no-no

And now it's time for us to say goodbye
Goodbye baby
You're leaving me
I know you've got to hurry home to face your wife, wife
I would never want to hurt her, no, no, no
She would never understand
You belong to me for just one night
As we slept the night away
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh
I would never, never want to hurt her, no, no, no
She would never understand
You belong to me for just one night
As we slept the night away
As we lay
We forgot about tomorrow
As we lay
Oh no, no, hey, hey, hey
As we lay
We didn't think about the price we'd have to pay
Oh no, no, no, no
We should have counted up the cost
But instead we got lost
In the second, in the minute, in the hours
Yeah, hey, hey, as we lay
We forgot about tomorrow as we lay
Oh no, oh no, no
My love, why can't you see
How loving you is killing me, baby, baby
I can't take it no more, no, oh
You see, I can't be in your life
You gotta go home to your wife, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
