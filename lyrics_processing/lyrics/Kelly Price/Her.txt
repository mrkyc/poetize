And everything it rings familiarly, mmm
But I can't imagine what you must be thinkin'
'Cuz she can never be what I can be
Oh, loneliness has really got you twisted
And there's so much your eyes don't even see, yeah
And then I laid my eyes upon your woman
And to my surprise I saw me lookin' at me
But how could you be with her?
Her
You don't really love her, no
She
'Cuz she's not me and I
I
I won't stand by and watch you pretend
So baby how could you?
Her
You don't really love her, no
She
'Cuz she's not me and I
I
I can't stand by and watch you pretend
We parted so that we could make it better
'Cuz boy, you said we needed time and space, mmm
We vowed that it was only temporary
But I never thought that I would be replaced
Now you're living all our dreams with another
And you're giving everything you promised me
You're pretending we're together when we're nothing
But she's not me, she can't be, no
How could you be with her, oh baby?
Her
You don't really love her, no, no
She
'Cuz she's not me and I
I
I can't stand by and watch you pretend
So how could you play me?
Her
'Cuz don't really love her, no
She
'Cuz she's not me and I
I
I can't stand by and watch you pretend
I never thought that you would be hurting this way
And I never thought I'd be without you, without you
You didn't have to run away to find me again
'Cuz I've always been here I am the real thing
So don't you pretend, oh
Her
You don't really love her
She
'Cuz she's not me and I
I
I can't stand by and watch you pretend
Oh
Her
You don't really love her, no
She
'Cuz you really love and and I
I
I can't stand by and let you pretend
We can start again
Her
Ya gotta let her go baby
She
And bring your love to me
I
I want your love, I need your love
