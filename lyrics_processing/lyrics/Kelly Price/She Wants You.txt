She wants you
And baby, I'm not fooled
She wants you
So don't you play the fool
(You say) You say she's just a friend
But I can see straight through
And baby, I'm not having it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

A true friend indeed
She was just a friend in need
She called to you just for help
She said she didn't have no one else
But I know that something's wrong
I felt it while we were on the phone
'Cause she's looking for love
And she's looking at you
I recognize the game, boy

She wants you (Oh yeah, yeah)
And baby, I'm not fooled (And baby, I'm no fool)
She wants you (She really wants you)
So don't you play the fool (Don't deny)
You say she's just a friend
But I can see straight through
Baby, I'm not having it
No, no, no, no, no
You might also like
Just you and me
Until this came to be
We never had an argument
Until the day you took her in, yeah
My love, this is killing me (Yes, it is)
The web she weaves, underhanded schemes
But I can see what you don't see
I've been here before
And I won't take no more

She wants you (She wants you)
And baby, I'm not fooled (I'm not fooled)
She wants you (No, no)
Don't you play the fool
(Gotta see what I see)
You say she's just a friend
But I can see straight through
Baby, I'm not having it

No, no, never gonna play fool
(Never gonna play a fool no more)
Like in "Friend of Mine" (No, no)
No, not this time
Never gonna let another one take what's mine
(She can't take what's mine)
Said you can't be so blind
I won't just sit here while she plans for you
So will you believe me? (Gotta believe me)
Gotta believe me (Baby, believe me)
Everything I say is true (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
She wants you (Oh, she wants you, oh, oh)
And baby, I'm not fooled (I'm not fooled)
She wants you (Oh, she wants you, oh, oh)
So don't you play the fool (Don't be a fool, baby)
You say she's just a friend
But I can see straight through
(I can see straight through it)
Baby, I'm not having it
(Yes, I can; yes, I can)
(I'm not having it, oh)
She wants you (She wants you, yeah, yeah)
And baby, I'm not fooled (Baby, I'm not fooled, no)
She wants you (She wants you, yeah)
So don't you play the fool (Yeah, oh)
You say she's just a friend (She is a friend)
But I can see straight through
(But I know she loves you, baby)
