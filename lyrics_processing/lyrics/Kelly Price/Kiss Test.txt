This is a test
This is only a test
(Verse 1)
Boy, do you know, what I'm feeling?
I'm overwhelmed, by your lovin'
I can't deny that I want you all the time
But I gotta know what you're thinkin'
Hit it and run, real affection
Whatever it is I won't let you waste my time
So how will I know

Baby with just a kiss, boy when you touch my lips
Honey, I'll know for sure, boy when my eyes meet yours
And if your love is true, I'll give to you my very best
Just pass the test
(Verse 2)
Boy, when I love it's completely
You'll do the same if you want me
Can't be a fool and just throw my heart away
But how will I know
How will I know what you're feelin' is real
When you say you love me
And how will I know if it's real
What you feel when you say you care
You might also like
Baby with just a kiss, boy when you touch my lips
Honey, I'll know for sure, boy when my eyes meet yours
And if your love is true, I'll give to you, my very best
Just pass the test
(Bridge:)
I've got a kiss on my lips and it's wearing your name
So hold on, oh, here it comes
I really wanna know it's really gonna show
The way you feel inside nowhere to hide

Baby with just a kiss, boy when you touch my lips
Honey, I'll know for sure, boy when my eyes meet yours
And if your love is true, I'll give to you my very best
Just pass the test
Baby with just a kiss, boy when you touch my lips
Honey, I'll know for sure, boy when my eyes meet yours
And if your love is true, I'll give to you my very best
Just pass the test
Baby with just a kiss, boy when you touch my lips
Honey, I'll know for sure, boy when my eyes meet yours
