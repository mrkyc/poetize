First time, I let you back inside
Everybody gets another chance
Second time, my mama replied
Said, "You gotta let him be a man"
Third time, I've had it with your lying
So sorry wouldn't work again
So I said, "Three strikes, you're out, no more
You're wrong, get gone, keep walking out my door"

Packed your bags while you were gone
They'll be waiting for you on the lawn
Changed the lock, so keep your key
We don't need to talk, so no apologies
I don't wanna feel like I'm going through
Time and time again if I'm loving you
So just walk away, leave me alone
This is for the best, so I'm moving on

(One, two, three, four)
You were messin' 'round
We're never really sure and
(Four, three, two, one)
You thought it was game
And you could have some fun
(One, two, three, four)
Said, "I won't be a fool
Won't let you back in my door, no"
(Four, three, two, one)
'Cause playtime is over
You're through, I'm done
You might also like
First time, I let you back inside
Everybody gets another chance
(Everybody gets another chance, baby)
Second time, my mama replied (My mama said)
Said, "You gotta let him be a man"
(Ooh, gotta let him be a man, oh)
Third time, I've had it with your lying (Yeah)
So sorry wouldn't work again (So I said)
So I said, "Three strikes, you're out, no more
You're wrong, get gone, keep walking out my door"

Had me fooled, loving you
Had me thinking 'bout spending life with you
So locked up in your tricky ways
Only thoughts of you had me in a daze
Then reality came and gave to me
What I needed most, that was eyes to see
You would never change, everything was game
Counting all the times really blows my mind

(One, two, three, four)
Mmm, you were messin' 'round
We're never really sure and
(Four, three, two, one)
Oh, you thought it was game
And you could have some fun, yeah
(One, two, three, four)
Oh, "I won't be a fool
And won't let you back in my door, yeah, yeah"
(Four, three, two, one)
Playtime is over
You're through, I'm done
First time, I let you back inside
Everybody gets another chance (Gave you another chance, baby)
Second time, my mama replied (My mama said)
Said, "You gotta let him be a man"
(Mama said I gotta let you be a man)
Third time, I've had it with your lying
So sorry wouldn't work again (So I said)
So I said, "Three strikes, you're out, no more
You're wrong, get gone, keep walking out my door"

(I hoped, mmm) I hoped, I prayed
You would come around, see it my way
Now it's too late (No, no)
No chances, go away, go away
(Hey, first time)

First time, I let you back inside (Oh)
Everybody gets another chance
(Everyone gets another chance)
Second time, my mama replied (My mama said)
Said, "You gotta let him be a man"
(My mama said you gotta let him be a man, ah yeah-yeah-yeah)
Third time, I've had it with your lying (Oh yeah)
So sorry wouldn't work again
(And sorry wouldn't work again, so I said)
So I said, "Three strikes, you're out, no more
You're wrong, get gone, keep walking out my door"
(I let you back in, yes, I did)
First, time I let you back inside
Everybody gets another chance
