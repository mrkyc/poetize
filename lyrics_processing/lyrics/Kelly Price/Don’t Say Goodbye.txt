Oh, baby
I, I, I don't wanna say, don't wanna say, don't wanna say
Mmm, hear me, baby

Don't say goodbye (Oh no)
I'll love you for my lifetime, oh woah
Without you, there is no me, mmm (I don't wanna say, no)
Don't say goodbye
'Cause soon, it will be all right (Oh yeah, yeah)
Baby, can't you see?

Baby, hold on
To what you know is real
We've had our share of problems
But they can't change the way I feel
We're gonna make it through the rough times
Together, you and I
I've been lovin' you too long
So stay with me, don't say goodbye

Don't say goodbye (Oh no)
I'll love you for my lifetime (I'll love you, baby)
Without you, there is no me, mmm
Don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
'Cause soon, it will be all right (It's gonna be, it's gonna be)
Baby, can't you see?

Baby, hold on
It won't be very long
All these problems we've been through
They're makin' our love strong
We've gotta hang in there
In just a little while
For every tear we've cried
We will wear a smile, don't say goodbye

Don't say goodbye (Oh no, no)
I'll love you for my lifetime (I'll love you, baby)
Without you, there is no me, mmm (I can't be here without you)
Don't say goodbye (Oh no)
'Cause soon, it will be all right (It will be all right)
Baby, can't you see?

'Cause I know (I know that we can make it)
Oh yeah, yeah (If we only try)
Oh, baby, don't worry 'bout a thing, you gotta believe me, yeah

(Don't ever say goodbye, goodbye) Don't say goodbye
I promise to love you baby, please
(Please stay with me baby, I don't wanna hear you say)
I don't wanna hear you say
('Cause I would go crazy) I would go crazy
(If you weren't with me) Oh, woah, please

I don't wanna hear you say
('Cause I would go crazy) Oh, if you weren't with me
(And, baby, can't you see?) Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye, I'll love you for my lifetime

'Cause soon it will be all right (If I couldn't have your love)
Baby, can't you see (Ooh, baby, I need your love)

Come hold me in the midnight hour (Don't say goodbye)
I need you in the midnight hour (I'll love you for my life time)
