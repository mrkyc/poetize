Saw you in the street one day
Walking up to you
Wanted just to say, baby
Instantly you looked the other way
You grabbed a lady's hand
Then you kissed the head of her little man
Started thinking, should I blow him up?
Tell her who I am?
Tell her we've been making so many plans?
But instead I left and I just cried
'Cause I was broke inside
Now I wanna know the reason why

Saw you walking by me
Strolling by casually like you didn't know my name
Baby in your wifey's arms
Breaking up my heart
You're a married man playing games
(Wish someone had told me)
Wish somebody told me 'fore I let you hold me
'Fore I let you in my bed
Never would've let you stay
Made you go away
You're a married man playing games
You might also like
So tell me why do this to me?
Why do this to her?
And why do this to your baby?
I loved you for your honesty
But it was just a lie
(Don't you know the way I'm feeling inside?) Ooh
You can't imagine how I feel
Thinking we were real then to find out we were nothing
I've been living in a faded dream
But reality quickly hit me when I saw you with her

Saw you walking by me
Strolling by casually like you didn't know my name
(Like you didn't know my name)
Baby in your wifey's arms (Yeah, yeah)
Breaking up my heart (Oh, oh)
You're a married man playing games
(Wish I would've known you were lying)
Wish somebody told me 'fore I let you hold me
'Fore I let you in my bed (Oh, oh)
Never would've let you stay
Made you go away
You're a married man playing games (Oh, oh)
Can't believe that you've been here with me
While you were keeping home with her
So now I am the other girl in your other world
And didn't even know I was, oh no
You really thought that you could be with me
While you were keeping secrecies
But all this dark will come to light
Baby that ain't right
How you fronted in the street
I saw you, oh

Saw you walking by me
Strolling by casually like you didn't know my name
(Like you didn't know my name)
Baby in your wifey's arms (I saw you there)
Breaking up my heart (Like you didn't care)
You're a married man playing games
(Oh, but you held me and you loved me)
Wish somebody told me 'fore I let you hold me
(What happened to all the love you gave?)
'Fore I let you in my bed
(What happened to all the love we made?)
Never would've let you stay
(Never woulda let you in my heart)
Made you go away
(No-no-no, no-no, no-no-no)
You're a married man playing games
(Oh, you're playing a game, yeah, yeah)
Saw you walking by me
Strolling by casually like you didn't know my name
(You walked on by like you didn't know my name)
Baby in your wifey's arms (No, no, no)
Breaking up my heart (Breaking my heart)
You're a married man playing games
