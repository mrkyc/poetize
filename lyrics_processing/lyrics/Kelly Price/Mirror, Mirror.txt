Been looking for love, and never could find it
While I'm standing here, and he is so blinded by her silly ways
He just can't imagine she's playing a game
A game that he played for so long, oh

I want him to know just how much I love him
I want it to show, but he just believes I'm a friend he can trust
But I wanna touch him
I love him enough to heal all the hurt in his heart
Oh yes I do, but how do I start?

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Can you tell me who to call
When the one I love is loving someone who can't see?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me if he'll ever fall so in love with me
Or could it be, it's just make-believe?

Boy, I had a dream, or maybe a vision
That I was your queen, 'cause I fit the slipper
You took me away to happily ever
We laughed and we made sweet love till the sun came again
Ah yeah, we did, mmm, but that was the end, oh

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Can you tell me who to call
When the one I love is loving someone who can't see?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me if he'll ever fall so in love with me
Or could it be, it's just make-believe?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

If you're looking for love, it's right in your face
I've been waiting for you, oh, so don't run away
Fairy tales can come true if you will believe
It will come true if you only believe (Yeah-yeah, whoa)

Mirror, mirror on the wall (Mirror on my wall)
Can you tell me who to call
When the one I love is loving someone who can't see?
(Yeah, hey, yeah)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (I wanna know)
Mirror, mirror, tell me
Is he gonna love me, is he gonna love me?
Or could it be, I'm living a dream?
(Yeah-yeah, ah! Mirror, mirror, yeah)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (Mirror, mirror, yeah)
I wanna know, I wanna know
Is he gonna know that I'm loving him, and I'm needing him?
Or will he always love someone who can't see him?
Mirror, mirror on the wall (Hey, hey)
