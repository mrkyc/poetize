It's here in my heart
And I can't even tell my friends
How much I adore you
I'm fallin' apart
I gotta kept it deep within
The way that I love you
I can't even say
I promised not to tell a soul
It won't last too long, a feeling so strong
But I can't hide the way
I can't hide
The way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killing me, cause
I wanna let the world know
It's you I'm lovin'
I can't hide
The way I'm feeling inside
The pain is killing me, cause
I wanna let the world know
It's you I'm lovin'

So why can't we just let it go?
