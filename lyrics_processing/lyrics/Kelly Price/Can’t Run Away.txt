No, no, no, no
Can not run away baby, oh
I can't run away boy
I can't run away
I'm telling you I can't run away
From what I am feeling
Feeling baby I can't run away
I think I'm gonna stay and I'm gonna love you
Until I can't love you no more
Oh baby the love that you're giving
Is more precious than my mind
Could ever be thinking
So there ain't no sense in trying
Cause I know I'll never find
Another baby to give it to me like you do, hey
I can't run away boy
I can't run away
I'm telling you I can't run away
From what I am feeling
Feeling baby I can't run away
I think I'm gonna stay and I'm gonna love you
Until I can't love you no more

For the way that you touch me
Cause honey I'm fiendin'
I can't get you off my mind
I'm thinkin' bout you all the time
So I'm gonna stay here
Until you give me what I want
I can't run away boy
I can't run away
I'm telling you I can't run away
From what I am feeling
Feeling baby I can't run away
I think I'm gonna stay and I'm gonna love you
Until I can't love you no more
Hold me baby hold me close
Hold me don't you let me go
When I get home
I'm planning on turning you on
Cause baby I want you so
Body and soul I'm yours
I can't run away boy
I can't run away
I'm telling you I can't run away
From what I am feeling
Feeling baby I can't run away
I think I'm gonna stay and I'm gonna love you
Until I can't love you no more
I can't run away boy

I'm telling you I can't run away
From what I am feeling
Feeling baby I can't run away
I think I'm gonna stay and I'm gonna love you
Until I can't love you no more

Gotta get away from what I am feeling
