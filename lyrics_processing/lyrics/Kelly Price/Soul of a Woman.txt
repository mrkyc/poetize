This song is dedicated, to all the brothers out there
Who've ever loved a woman, whether it was your mother
Whether it was a lover or whether it was your daughter
In every woman lies a soul and in the soul of every woman
Lies the secrets of love and sometimes, you don't do right by her
But the way back to her heart, lives in that same soul
You just have to find it
(Verse 1)
So pure, there through thick and thin
No shame in showing, she is your best friend
So strong and though you've let her down
You won't see her frown but make it right, and look inside

You will find, she was everything your heart desired
But nevertheless she cries but you never cherished her
You took for granted love
You sigh, remembering the times she made you smile
And knowing that down inside, she was the only one
Who'd love you forevermore

In her soul you'll find the way to bring her back into your world
Grown mind but she's just a precious little girl
In her soul you'll find things that made your life seem so worthwhile
Then you can give it in return
You might also like(Verse 2)
So real, the way she'll sacrifice
Only for you to have the best in life
Been too long, you need to let her know
You wanna make it right, you gotta touch her soul to find
You will find, she was everything your heart desired
But nevertheless, she cries but you never cherished her
You took for granted love
You sigh remembering the times she made you smile
And knowing that down inside, she was the only one
Who'd love you forevermore

In her soul you'll find the way to bring her back into your world
Grown mind but she's just a precious little girl
In her soul you'll find things that made your life seem so worthwhile
Then you can give it in return
(Bridge:)
You can't buy, can never buy her love
Can never buy her love 'cuz money
Just won't fill the void you made, oh, no
You wanna have her love
You've gotta earn her love
Her soul will lead the way
And show you where to go
In her soul, you'll find the way to bring her back into your world
Grown mind but she's just a precious little girl
In her soul, you'll find things that made your life seem so worthwhile
Then you can give it in return
In her soul, you'll find the way to bring her back into your world
Grown mind but she's just a precious little girl
In her soul, you'll find things that made your life seem so worthwhile
