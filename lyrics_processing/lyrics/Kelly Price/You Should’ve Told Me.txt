I wouldn't call in the midnight hour
I wouldn't tuck you in and turn the nightlight out
You would walk through the door and I wouldn't say hi
I would walk out the door and wouldn't say bye-bye
It's funny that I never thought about it that way
I never knew the things that I did not say
But you were lonely and you were hungry
And I was living in my own world
Thinking I'm a perfect lady

You should've told me
I wasn't small enough
You should've told me
I didn't call enough
But you led me on
And kept me going
And we never should've wasted this time
You should've told me
I wasn't wild enough
You should've told me
I didn't smile enough
What you had in my mind
Made me lose my mind
And we never should've wasted this time

I wasn't there to help you take your clothes off
When it was time for work, didn't see you off
When you were tense, didn't give a massage
I never told you I think you're hot, oh
It's funny how I never thought about it that way
Never knew the things that I did not say
But you were lonely and you were hungry
And I was living in my own world
Thinking I'm a perfect lady, ay-yeah

You should've told me (Yeah)
I wasn't small enough (Ooh-whoa-oh)
You should've told me (Baby)
I didn't call enough (Yeah)
But you led me on (You led me on)
And kept me going (Yes, you did)
And we never should've wasted this time (You should've told)
You should've told me (Oh-ooh)
I wasn't wild enough (Oh-whoa-oh-ooh)
You should've told me
I didn't smile enough (Oh, no)
What you had in my mind
Made me lose my mind (Oh-oh)
And we never should've wasted this time (Whoa-oh)
When you thought you had to lie (Oh, lie)
Why didn't you come and tell me why? (When it hurt)
Didn't you see those tears I cried? (Hey-hey)
Oh, why? (Oh-whoa-oh)

You should've told me (Told me)
I wasn't small enough (Hey, baby)
You should've told me (Told me)
I didn't call enough (I didn't call enough)
But you led me on (You led me on)
And kept me going (And kept me going)
And we never should've wasted this time (Why didn't you tell me?)
You should've told me (I need to know)
I wasn't wild enough (The truth, baby)
You should've told me (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
I didn't smile enough (Yeah)
What you had in my mind (Had in mind)
Made me lose my mind (Lose my mind)
And we never should've wasted this time (I needed to know, baby)
You should've told me (That I was)
I wasn't small enough (Too much woman for you)
You should've told me (Oh, baby)
I didn't call enough (Hey-hey)
But you led me on (You led me on)
And kept me going (And kept me going)
And we never should've wasted this time (I won't waste my time for you no more)
