You're not my daddy. You're my man
I think it's time you understand
So just make me happy if you can (Oh)
I'm not your mama, I'm your girl
And I am the lady in your world
And loving each other's how we work. (Oh)

Trust. Without it there's no love
It's true no matter what you try
Us, there can be no us
Unless we find the strength to fight

I spy, you seek. You watch, I peek. So what are we doin' with our love? It's not how it's posed' to be

You're not my daddy. You're my man
I think it's time you understand
So just make me happy if you can (Oh)
I'm not your mama, I'm your girl
And I am the lady in your world
And loving each other's how we work. (Oh)

Sure, are we really sure?
Maybe we should close the door
Oh, the storms, we try to stand the storms
You might also likeWe've been holdin' on too long

I pray, you weep. You cry, I speak. See, what are we doin' with our love? It's not how posed' to be

You're not my daddy. You're my man
I think it's time you understand
So just make me happy if you can (Oh)
I'm not your mama, I'm your girl
And I am the lady in your world
And loving each other's how we work. (Oh)

Ooh, please, come to me with sweet words like when we met. Ooh, screams. Yells & screams. Change the language that we talkin'. I'll just get to walkin'. Baby, Baby!

You're not my daddy. You're my man
I think it's time you understand
So just make me happy if you can (Oh)
I'm not your mama, I'm your girl
And I am the lady in your world
And loving each other's how we work. (Oh)
You're not my daddy. You're my man.
