Lord, I dedicate this song to you
Thank you for the oppourtunity to share my gift of song with the world
You created me and this ability I possess to express everything I am and hope
To be through music
I know that without you I'm nothing
And I know in my heart I just wanna say that now and forever you shall be
Lord of all in my life

Maker of the heavens, artist the sea
Creator of the sunshine and the sculptor of me
But still they laugh and mock you
Some don't believe and they fail to realize that you reign eternally (Oh, Lord)

Lord of all, (You are holy) holy and exalted
(You still reign on the throne, on the throne) You still reign upon the throne
(Lord of everything) Lord of all, (Oh you are, high) high and lifted up
Oh, you shall always be Lord of all

There are those who pray to dead idols
Cause they believe that they will come again
But soon they will all bow down and worship the lamb
And proclaim that he is Lord, Lord

Messiah, (And every child's gonna confess) my Lord (You are Lord, you are Lord, yes, you are)
Messiah, (Yeah-yeah, yes) my Lord (I proclaim you)
You shall always be Lord of all, yeah oh
Messiah, (I worship you Jesus) my Lord (You're Lord of Lords, and everything)
Messiah, (Oh, everything I longed for) my Lord (Oh-oh, Jesus)
Messiah, (Messiah, you are) my Lord (Yeah-oh, you will)
You shall always be (You will always be) Lord of all (I love you Lord 'cause you heard my cry, and pitied every wrong, yeah)
You shall always be (You will always be) be Lord of all (Yeah, yeah, hey yeah)
