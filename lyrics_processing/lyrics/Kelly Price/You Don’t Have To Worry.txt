You don't have to worry 'bout me
'Cause I'm fine, well, it's alright, I'm okay
And you don't have to worry 'bout me
Comes a time when every woman makes up her mind
That she's through and nothing's gonna change her view
Had enough and though the road ahead may seem tough
So long, but there's no need for hangin' on
I'll take the dog, you get the cat
Not this time, I'm gone
You take it all, no strings attached
'Cause I'm movin' on
I'll go, you stay
You don't have to worry 'bout me
'Cause I'm fine, well, it's alright, I'm okay
And you don't have to worry 'bout me
You believe that no one else will love me like you
Hope it's true 'cause I don't want another you
Too long, I blamed myself for what you did wrong
No more, made up my mind to hit the door
I'll take the dog, you get the cat
Not this time, I'm gone
You have it all, no strings attached
'Cause I'm movin' on
You might also likeI'll go, you stay
You don't have to worry 'bout me
'Cause I'm fine, well, it's alright, I'm okay
And you don't have to worry 'bout me
(Hey, you can have it all)
Have it all
(The house, the cars, take what you need)
All I want
(All I want is just to be free)
I am sure
(I'm sure you never thought I would leave)
Now I'm gone
(And you don't have to hold me)
Oh, scream and shout but do it while I'm on my way out
Act a fool but that won't make me stay here with you
Silly rabbit, I thought you knew the tricks were for kids
And I'm a full grown woman, yes, I am, oh
I'll take the dog, you get the cat
Not this time, I'm gone
You have it all, no strings attached
I'm movin' on
I'll go, you stay
You don't have to worry 'bout me
'Cause I'm fine, well, it's alright, I'm okay
And you don't have to worry 'bout me
I'll go, you stay
You don't have to worry 'bout me
'Cause I'm fine, well, it's alright, I'm okay
You don't have to worry 'bout me
I'll go, you stay
You don't have to worry 'bout me
'Cause I'm fine, well, it's alright, I'm okay
