Oh, hmm oh yeah, hmm, hmm, hmm

I'm on way back to Atlanta
About to start a new life
'Cause I can't take it here
It seems the more we fight
The more the pressure
I'm in this lonely house
Sitting high up on a hill

Pressin' the buttons on the control
Flipping through channels on TV
Wondering when you're coming home
And take care of family

At least you can call and say I'm busy
At least you can say I'm running late
At least you can give some kind of notice
Let somebody know that you're okay
At least you can take some time to phone
At least you can just one day stay home
At least you can take me out to eat
If you love me, you would've done those things
You might also like
You won't miss me 'til I'm gone
Impossible to drink from a well that's gone dry, yeah
And every night you come in singing the same old song
How could you do me wrong?
When you know it ain't right

Pressin' the buttons on the control
Flipping through channels on TV
Wondering when you're coming home
And take care of family

At least you can call and say I'm busy
At least you can say I'm running late
At least you can give some kind of notice
Let somebody know that you're okay
At least you can take some time to phone
At least you can just one day stay home
At least you can take me out to eat
If you love me, you would've done those things

Take in a movie show, a carnival
A place to go, we can be alone
But instead, I'm staring at these matching walls
The weekends spent, a compliment
Flowers sent would've kept me at home
But now instead I'm packing my bags and I'm gone
At least you can call and say I'm busy
At least you can say I'm running late
At least you can give some kind of notice
Let somebody know that you're okay
At least you can take some time to phone
At least you can just one day stay home
At least you can take me out to eat
If you love me, you would've done those things
At least you can call and say I'm busy
At least you can say I'm running late
At least you can give some kind of notice
Let somebody know that you're okay
At least you can take some time to phone
At least you can just one day stay home
At least you can take me out to eat
If you love me, you would've done those things

All I wanted was a smile
For you to stay a little while
It's too late for it
'Cause you forgot the little things, whoa, oh

At least you can call and say I'm busy
At least you can say I'm running late
At least you can give some kind of notice
Let somebody know that you're okay
At least you can take some time to phone
At least you can just one day stay home
At least you can take me out to eat
