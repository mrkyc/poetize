Mm-hmm
Ooh-whoa
Yeah-yeah
Oh, baby
Mmm-oh oh

I read you wrong
You said you'd only be away a while
But the days turned into weeks
And all the weeks into miles
Baby, why?
You could've told me you were tellin' me goodbye
Could've come clean and let me walk away in style, oh-oh

Funny thing is
While I was missin' you
While I was figuring
What I was gonna do

I got wise, I got hip
I caught on to your tricks
I got over it real quick, yeah, baby (Got over it)
While you were gone (Oh)
Now I'm cool, can't you tell? (Cool, ooh-oh)
Feel so good about myself
A funny thing happened to me, baby
While you were gone (Oh-ooh)
You might also like
You looked surprised
Like no one ever left you and survived, no
Well, leavin' me alone
Has kind of opened my eyes
Baby, you
You gave me the time to find somebody new
And I found strength inside me I never knew, oh-oh-whoa

Funny thing is
While he was holdin' me
While he was showin' me
How it's supposed to be

I got wise, I got hip (I got wise)
I caught on to your tricks (Caught on to your lies)
I got over it real quick, yeah, baby (Oh-oh, baby)
While you were gone (Whoa-ho)
Now I'm cool, can't you tell? (Cool)
Feel so good about myself (Oh)
A funny thing happened to me, baby
While you were gone
I got wise, I got hip (Didn't freak, didn't cry)
I caught on to your tricks (I just held my head up high)
I got over it real quick, yeah, baby (I learned how to say goodbye)
While you were gone
Now I'm cool, can't you tell? (Had time on my hands)
Feel so good about myself (Baby, don't you understand?)
A funny thing happened to me, baby (To me, baby)
While you were gone
(While you were, while you were gone)
Had nothin' but time on my hands (Oh), boy
(While you were, while you were gone)
Learned how to understand (Oh), boy
(While you were, while you were gone)
Got over it, got over you, oh (Oh, I had)
While he was holdin' me (Whoa)
While he was showin' me (While he was showin' me)
How it's supposed to be
Oh, baby-yeah

I got wise, I got hip (Yeah, yeah)
I caught on to your tricks (I got wise)
I got over it real quick, yeah, baby (I'm over you, oh)
While you were gone (While you were gone)
Now I'm cool, can't you tell? (Learned how to get along)
Feel so good about myself (I don't need you no more)
A funny thing happened to me, baby (Yeah-yeah)
While you were gone (Hey-yeah)
I got wise, I got hip
I caught on to your tricks (I got wise)
I got over it real quick, yeah, baby (I learned, I learned)
While you were gone (How to love someone)
Now I'm cool, can't you tell? (My baby)
Feel so good about myself (Ooh-ooh, oh)
A funny thing happened to me, baby (While you)
While you were gone (Whoa)
While you were gone, oh-oh oh-whoa (While you were gone)
Learned a lie (While you were gone)
Learned a lesson (While you were gone)
Learned how to get along (While you were gone)
Learned how to be strong (While you were gone)
