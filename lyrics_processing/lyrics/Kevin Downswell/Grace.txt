Yeah, grace
Can't do without it
Thank You, thank You

Some said I wouldn't
Some said I couldn't
I wondered if I could have
Battles in my head
Times I felt lost and broken
Felt like I couldn't make it through the day
But I knew God had spoken and He promised not to leave me

So I'm standing here today
Saying, "How did I get here?"

I call it grace, grace, grace
Grace brought me here
If it wasn't for Your grace
I call it grace, grace, grace
Grace brought me here, God
If it wasn't for Your grace
You might also like
Times I felt lost and broken
Felt like I would have never made it through the day
But I knew God had spoken and He promised not to leave me
Never know you'd still be here
Never knew you'd still be sane
Never knew you'd smile again
Never know you'd hope again

So I'm standing here today
Saying, "How did I get here?"

I call it grace, grace, grace
Grace brought me here
If it wasn't for Your grace
I call it grace, grace, grace
Grace brought me here, God
If it wasn't for Your grace

Mm-mm-mm-mm (Ooh, ooh)
Mm-mm-mm-mm (Ooh, ooh)
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm
Have you ever been through something
And come out on the other side
And look back and wonder how?
You know it's a miracle
'Cause God is with you
'Cause without Him, where would we be?

I call it grace, grace, grace
Grace brought me here
If it wasn't for Your grace
I call it grace, grace, grace
Grace brought me here, God
If it wasn't for Your grace

Mm-mm-mm-mm (Ooh, ooh)
Mm-mm-mm-mm (Ooh, ooh)
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm (Ooh, ooh)
Mm-mm-mm-mm (Ooh, ooh)
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm
I call it grace, grace, grace
Grace brought me here
If it wasn't for Your grace
I call it grace, grace, grace
Grace brought me here, God
