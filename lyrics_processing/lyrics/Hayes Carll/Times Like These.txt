In times like these everyone could use a hand
Instead we stand around losing ground
Fighting for the promised land
It's so hard to tell if this is heaven or hell
And I could never measure by degrees
But it's sure gettin' warm 'round here in times like these
In times like these do I really need a billionaire
Just takin' all my time tryin' to tell me I was treated unfair?
Well then I got to pay, it's the home of the brave
Gets divided into them and the weak
Oh I find I'm a-losing my mind in times like these

Yeah they come and they go
They're in and then out
Every day I'm getting better at losing something I haven't got
I just wanna do my labor, love my girl, and help my neighbor
While I keep a little hope for my dreams
But it's sure getting hard, brother, in times like these

In times like these I wish someone was on my side
Instead of bringing it together we're just widening the great divide
I hope and I pray at the end of the day
I can somehow get my troubles to ease
But I gotta say, it's not looking good, not in times like these

Yeah they come and they go
They're cold then they're hot
I just try to keep the world from turning me to something I'm not
I'm gonna try to run until the whole thing's done
And I just hope I don't end up on my knees
But it's sure getting hard to stand up in times like these

I just wanna do my labor, love my girl, and help my neighbor
While I'm keeping all my joie de vivre
But it's sure getting hard, brother, in times like these
