You were smokin' on a cigarette
Talkin' about the deficit
Puttin' all them wild boys down
Like a drunken Mona Lisa
Or the Leanin' Tower of Pisa
You were hangin' off the edge of town
I overheard Afghanistan
Is safer than a minivan
Left me wonderin' what to do
You're like a four-leaf clover
I just had to come on over
I have never seen a woman like you

You were fallin' like the Alamo
Drinkin' fast and talkin' slow
Lookin' like it's time to go home (Well)
Well, you're hittin' on that stripper
'Cause you can't afford to tip her (Hey now)
Or just afraid of bein' alone
You was openly frustrated
You said Dylan's overrated
While singin' "Tangled Up In Blue"
I don't know what I was thinkin'
I could feel my heart a-sinkin'
I've never seen a fellow like you

Ain't that the way we do? It's true, we fall for the first one
How come it always ends up the worst one?

Well, you're probably a Democrat
Well, what the hell is wrong with that?
Nothin' if you're Taliban (Ah, I see)
Well, I bet you slept with half the south
Oh, don't you ever shut your mouth?
Yeah, how much did you pay for that tan?
More than you paid for your boots
Ah, shouldn't you be purgin'?
Well, you're probably still a virgin
I can't believe you're not on The View
Let's get another round
It's lookin' like we're trouble bound
I have never seen another like you

Ain't that the way we do, it's true, you take the breath from me
It seems like you are bound to be the death of me

Oh, well, a couple hours later
We were in the elevator
Makin' out like Bonnie and Clyde
We were dizzy from the love we found
Throwin' up and goin' down
Lord, it's been a hell of a ride
I'm a-havin' trouble breathin'
I probably should be leavin'
Well, I'm up in room 402
I gotta hand it to you
There's a chance I'm gonna screw you
Oh, I have never seen another like you
I don't know if it's forever
But I'm glad that we're together
