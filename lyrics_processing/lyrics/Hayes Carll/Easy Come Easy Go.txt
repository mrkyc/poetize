Seems like every Friday evenin'
She'd find herself in Jail
Not a friend this side of Houston
With the time to throw her bail
But she'll be fine, she'll be fine
Spent a lifetime walkin'
Through the walls of a broken home
Not a man round here still standin'
For the girl to call her own
Every time she tried to hold him
She just ended up alone
But there's still time, there's still time
Davey drove a taxi
Through the streets of Boston town
Like the billboards up above him
The world just wore him down
Only soul he'd ever cared for
Was the one he'd never found
But He'll be fine, He'll be fine
Broken Half of Winter, with a wind chill ten below
Davey sittin' in his kitchen laughin 'bout
How the world had done him so
Then the postman burst his bubble
With a letter from below
And now it's time, now it's time

And there's a lot of people runnin' round
Not quite sure which way to go
But as for me I believe I finally found
It's just easy come and easy go
Jamie grabbed a bottle, threw her apron on the bar
Packed her whole world in a suitcase
And tossed it in the car
Woke up in Texarkana
Wondrin' how she'd got this far
And on her own, on her own
Stranger at the motel let Jamie stay for free
She was gone before the daybreak
On her ways to Tennessee
Lookin' to make the whole world over
Into a place she wants to be
But not alone, not alone
Davey left his taxi
In the bottom of a Beantown lake
He said this whole world's full of chances
And this is one I gotta take
So he caught the line to Nashville
To finally find his break
And make a home, make a home
As the train flew out of Boston
His whole world passed him by
He said I spent a lifetime runnin'
And now's the time to try
If I can't find someone to hold me
My dreams will surely die
And I'll be gone, I'll be gone
Repeat Chorus
When Davey hit the pavement
The sky was almost gray
He lit a smoke off of the sidewalk
To drive the storm away
And when Jamie turned the corner
With the world upon her brow
Davey said I must be dreamin'
How could this happen now
And then she walked right towards him
Looked him right up in the eye
Davey reached out for forever
And Jamie walked on by
