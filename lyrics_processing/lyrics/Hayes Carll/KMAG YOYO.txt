Well, daddy joined the Air Force
Said it was a good source
Danger, love, and money, but it only led to divorce
Ended up in Abilene
Working at a Dairy Queen
Put me in the Army on the day that I turned seventeen
Here I am standin' in the desert with a gun
Thought of going AWOL but I'm too afraid to run
So I got myself a new plan
Stealin' from the Taliban
Make a little money turning poppies into heroin
Sergeant didn't like it so they put me in a hole
I said, "It's easy shootin' when they don't know where to go."
Threw me on a lily pad
Sent me home to NORAD
I knew I'd be in trouble but I didn't think it be this bad

Stranger wearin' all black
Met me on the tarmac
Told him I was sorry, but I ain't ever going back
He said, "You ain't in trouble, son
Learn to fight without a gun
Got a new assignment now, you're working for the Pentagon
Gonna take a trip, wouldn't tell me what it's for
Gotta serve your country, gonna help us win the war"
MIT, PhD.'s, night & day, they're testing me
Ain't what I was thinking but I'm being all that I can be
I ain't no genius but I knew it wasn't right
Eating uppers in the morning and LSD at night
Send me off to deep space
Help 'em win the arms race
Ola me, oh mighty, but this shit has got a funny taste
See Hayes Carll LiveGet tickets as low as $40You might also like
I think I hear the countdown
Hundred feet above the ground
Told me when I'm leavin' but a'nothing 'bout a'coming down
Sittin' on a bad dream
Thousand pounds of gasoline
Ain't leavin' nothing but some rubble and my slipstream
Mama always said, I should be aimin' for the moon
Never would've guessed that I'd be passin' by soon
How the hell'd I get here?
Blastin' through the atmosphere
Drop the rocket boosters and I'm shiftin' into high gear
Bowie on the system and a bottle on my knee
Armstrong ain't got nothing on me
Hey ho, here we go
KMAG YOYO
Someone wanna get me, gotta come up where the sun don't go

I think I see a bright light
Something 'bout it ain't right
I laid down in a space ship
Woke up in a fire-fight
Trippin' from the morphine
Came down in a bad scene
God, don't let me die here, I ain't even nineteen
I won't ever ask you, Lord, for anything again
I'll swear it on the Bible, Torah or Koran
Lyin' in a rhino track
'Bout to have a heart attack
IED got to me, someone call the Medevac
I need some fixin' after where it is I've been
Never wanna go and try and shoot a gun again
Slippin' out the back door
Gonna join the Peace Corps
Tell me I'm a hero now, so
