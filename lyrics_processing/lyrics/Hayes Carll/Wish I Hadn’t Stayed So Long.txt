All scattered across the yard
I'd-a stayed back home in houston
If I'd known it be this hard
Oh but as it is I'm busted
I broke down across the bay
And I might not make December
If we keep carrying on this way
Pretty girls and deep depressions
Keep falling from the sky
I got all the time in heaven
But no sense to wonder why
And the nights have all gone crazy
And the bars have all shut down
One day I swear I'll blow it all
Pack up and leave this town
And sometimes I get so tired
Of telling right from wrong
Hey i'm glad I came
Just wish I hadn't stayed so long
Here I am in music city
Long nights and neon signs
And I can't seem to remember
What I came so far to find
Police cars and paper money
Motel rooms and cigarettes
Here to tell you ain't nothin'
Just in case you might forget

In the window up above
Do they do it for the money
Do it, do it for the love
Bourbon eyes and stolen pistolss
Seemed all that comes my way
I'm gonna burn down all my bridges
Find a car and drive away
And sometimes I can't believe
I did all that for a song
Hey i'm glad I came
Just wish I hadn't stayed so long
We could make Louisiana
In two hours time
We could pull off of the highway
By the big casino sign
And we could take up all our wishes
And bet 'em all on black
Hit the lights of Mississippi
With the Southland at our backs
And it's always been the same
Down every road I've come
Hey I'm glad I came
