(We could be legends, we can be legends
We could be legends, we can be legends)
We could be legends after all
Hey, woah, woah
We could be legends after all
Hey, woah, woah

Do you remember bein' young?
The world in our hands, your heart in a song
Do you remember bein' young?
Remember, remember
Nothin's ever what it seems
Forget who you are, forget how to dream
I think it's time that we believe
Remember, remember

We could be wild, and we could be free
We can be anything in life we wanna be
We could move mountains, we could break walls
We can stand tall enough to fight and never fall

We can be legends after all
Hey, woah, woah
We could be legends after all
Hey, woah, woah
We could be legends after all

Do you remember growing up?
Standin' all alone, your back to the sun
Do you remember growing up?
Remember, remember
Tell me how it's gonna be
If we win or lose, wear your heart on your sleeve
I think it's time that we believe
Remember, remember

We could be wild, and we could be free
We can be anything in life we wanna be
We could move mountains, we could break walls
We can stand tall enough to fight and never fall

We could be legends after all
Hey, woah, woah
We could be legends after all
Hey, woah, woah
We could be legends after all

We could be legends, we can be legends
We could be legends after all
We could be legends, we could be legends
Stand up and shout it out if you want it
Remember, remember
Reach out and touch the sky 'cause you got it
We'll be here forever
Stand up and shout it out if you want it
Remember, remember
Reach out and touch the sky 'cause you got it
We'll be here forever
(Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever)

We could be wild, we could be free
We can be anything in life we wanna be
We could move mountains, we could break walls
We can stand tall enough to fight and never fall

We can be legends after all
Hey, woah, woah
We could be legends after all
Hey, woah, woah
We could be legends after all

Stand up and shout it out if you want it
Remember
Reach out and touch the sky 'cause you got it
