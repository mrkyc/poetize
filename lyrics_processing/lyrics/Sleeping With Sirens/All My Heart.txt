There's so many things that I could say
But I'm sure it would come out all wrong
You've got something that I can't explain
Still I'll try and try and let you know
The first summer we spent's one will never forget
Looking for any kind of reason to escape all the mess
That we thought was what made us, ain't it funny now?
We can see, we're who we're meant to be

You still have all of my
You still have all of my
You still have all my heart

Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh

There's too many times I have to say
I could have been better and stronger for you and me
You always make me feel okay
Those late summers we spent, stay up talking all night
I'd ask: "You think we'd ever make it?" You say: "I'm sure, if it's right."
Ain't it funny to think just how stupid I used to be?
Hope you always believe
You might also like
You still have all of my
You still have all of my
You still have all my heart

You still have all of my
You still have all of my
You still have all my heart

Let them talk and talk and talk, let them say what they want
We will laugh at the thought they don't know what we got
Every year that goes by, a year older we are
You'll still be beautiful then, bless your beautiful heart
We'll talk and talk and talk, how crazy is it?
Someone could waste their whole life helplessly
Just patiently waiting for a love like you and me

You still have all of my
You still have all of my
You still have all my heart

(You still have all of my heart)
You still have all of my (You still have all of my heart)
You still have all of my (You still have all of my heart)
You still have all my heart (You still have all of my heart)
You still have all of my (I've been waiting my whole life for something to save me)
You still have all of my (I still can't believe that you are mine)
