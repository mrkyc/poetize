Yeah, oh

I know that hope weighs on your mind, lost within the seams
It seems like we lose ourselves in between
But the harder things become, the harder you push away
Oh baby, yeah, baby, it kills me

You said it, you said it
I'll take you at your word
Promises that you can't keep
It's getting harder to hold on
You said it, you said it
Don't ever let me fall
Don't give up because you're losing
You haven't lost

In time you'll find that we can sober up
Clean up any dirt so we can open up
These wounds have been open for forever now
Come on, be strong
Your mind has gotten the best of you
You've done enough and you are enough
Let's fall asleep tonight
I'll hold you close and show you you're not broken (Broken)
You might also like
You said it, you said it
I'll take you at your word
Promises that you can't keep
It's getting harder to hold on
You said it, you said it
Don't ever let me fall
Don't give up because you're losing
(Losing, losing, losing, losing, losing...)

(Hold on, hold on)
(Hold, just hold on)
Don't you think if it's meant to be, it will be?
Don't you think things will work out eventually? Eventually?
Hold on

You said it, you said it
I'll take you at your word
Promises that you can't keep
It's getting harder to hold on
You said it, you said it
Don't ever let me fall
Don't give up because you're losing
You said it, you said it
I'll take you at your word
Promises that you can't keep
It's getting harder to hold on
You said it, you said it
Don't ever let me fall
Don't give up because you're losing
