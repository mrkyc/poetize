Is it naive to make plans that seem so far away?
There's a reason I feel this way
You're sleeping alone, I'm awake
When you dream of me tonight, am I close to where you are?

Lay me down
And tell me everything will be alright (Things will be alright)
Things will be alright (Things will be alright)
Lay me down
And tell me everything will be alright (Things will be alright)
Things will be alright (Things will be alright)
This could mean everything or nothing at all
You take what is real, I'll give you my all

Is it naive to make plans that seem so, so, so far?
I think, "Let's not wait, let's love right now
Let's love right now"

Lay me down (Lay me down)
And tell me everything will be alright (Things will be alright)
Things will be alright (Things will be alright)
Lay me down
And tell me everything will be alright (Things will be alright)
Things will be alright (Things will be alright)

Oh, here where we lie
Outstretched to wonder why we don't belong
You deserve much more, and I'll give until I'm all gone
Forever know your face and ever take your place here by my side
Like a ghost into the night
The poisoned apple to my bite
I'll be the shadow at your door
I'll be the moth into your light
'Cause you deserve much more
Yeah, you deserve much more

Lay me down (Lay me down)
And tell me everything will be alright (Things will be alright)
Things will be alright (Things will be alright)
Thunder storms could never shake us
Lay me down and kiss me like things will be alright (Things will be alright)
Everything will be alright (Things will be alright)
This could mean everything or nothing at all
You take what is real, I'll give you my all
(The poisoned apple to my bite)
This could mean everything or nothing at all
(I'll be the shadow at your door)
(I'll be the moth into your light)
You take what is real, I'll give you my all
