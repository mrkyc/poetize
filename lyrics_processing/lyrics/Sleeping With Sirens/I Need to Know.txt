You got a pretty face, I got this broken heart
Two starlit lovers, we were destined to be torn apart
You said you needed space, I got a couple scars
Guess you're the reason for the tears, I left them where you are
I never wanted to own you
I never wanted to hold you down
Maybe another place, maybe another time
Till then let's say goodbye, I'll see you in another life

It always feels like we're out here alone
We're searching for new life, but how could we know?

And when the night times calling and the rain starts falling
Will you still remember my name?
And when you're out till morning and the drinks keep pouring
Do you think you'll feel the same?
I need to know, I need to know
Do you feel the same? Do you feel the same?

You are my universe, I was your falling star
There were no others, and we knew it from the very start
You said you wanted love, the kind that made you real
I gave you everything that anyone could ever feel
You might also like
It always feels like we're out here alone
We're searching for new life, but how could we know?

And when the night times calling and the rain starts falling
Will you still remember my name?
And when you're out till morning and the drinks keep pouring
Do you think you'll feel the same?
I need to know, I need to know
Do you feel the same?
I need to know, I need to know
Do you feel the same? Would you call my name?

Sometimes when you love someone, you gotta let them go
Let them go
Will you feel the same in the pouring rain?
Will you scream my name? I need to know

And when the night times calling and the rain starts falling
Will you still remember my name?
And when you're out till mourning and the drinks keep pouring
Do you think you'll feel the same?
I need to know, I need to know
I need to know, I need to know
