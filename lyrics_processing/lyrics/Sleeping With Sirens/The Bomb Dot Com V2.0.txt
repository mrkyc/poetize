Just open up like a page in a book
These words that I'm writing won't be misunderstood
If I'm dishonest, bring me back to my knees
Show me why I'm even able to speak
I'll testify, please help me to see
Don't close your eyes, keep your eyes on me
Open up, open up now (So make me strong)

There's blood on my hands and the killer's not my enemy
It's all for the sake of love, it's all for you

When all we know is falling, I'll save something for you
You who are all alone (All alone)
When everything is beautiful, when everything's okay
Even if it's not okay, I'll say "It's all for you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you and only you"
(Only you)

These hands hold up nothing but scars underneath
From swimming these oceans and learning to breathe
So often I tell them, so often they listen to me
(So make me strong)

There's blood on my hands and the killer's not my enemy
It's all for the sake of love, it's all for you

When all we know is falling, I'll save something for you
You who are all alone (All alone)
When everything is beautiful, when everything's okay
Even if it's not okay, I'll say "It's all for you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you and only you"

I can feel it in my fingertips, oh
(I can feel) And I can taste it in the air
(And I'm hoping there's someway I can follow)
I know somehow there's something new
I've seen it so clearly
I can feel your hand on my fingertips
I'm seeing, oh, so clear, I know it's for you
I see so clear

(It's all for you)
When all we know is falling, I'll save something for you
You who are all alone (All alone)
When everything is beautiful, when everything's okay
