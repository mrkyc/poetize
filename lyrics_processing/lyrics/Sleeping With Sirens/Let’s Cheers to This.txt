I've got the whole world in front of me
I'm not letting go 'till I say
This is my life, I've got it all right in front of me
I won't let it go, there's no way
This is our time, don't slip away, don't slip away

I'm losing control, my head is alright
I can't shake the thought of me losing my mind
Been away for three days, won't sleep 'till I've done
All it is I'm living for
Now I will show you all that I'm made of

This is my life (This is my life)
I've got the whole world in front of me
I'm not letting go 'till I say
This is my life, don't slip away, don't slip away
I made up my mind, this time I know
Know it all comes down to this
This is our time, this is our time
Don't slip away, don't slip away

For all of the times I spent waiting
For all of the long nights alone
I finally know what it means to
Have something I can call my own
The show must go on
So we'll show you all that we're made of
You might also like
This is my life (This is my life)
I've got the whole world in front of me
I'm not letting go 'till I say
This is my life, don't slip away, don't slip away
I made up my mind, this time I know
Know it all comes down to this
This is our time, this is our time
Don't slip away, don't slip away

Your soul is down, I'll break the dawn
I took the stage, and now we're taking back tonight
I made up my mind, this is my life

This is my life (This is my life)
I've got the whole world in front of me
I'm not letting go 'till I say
This is my life, don't slip away, don't slip away
I made up my mind, this time I know
Know it all comes down to this
This is our time, this is our time
Don't slip away, don't slip away
