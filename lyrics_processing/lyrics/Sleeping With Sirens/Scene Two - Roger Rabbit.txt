Is there a right way for how this goes?
You've got your friends and you've got your foes
They want a piece of somethin' hot
Forget your name like they forgot
Oh, ain't that somethin'?

So when I see you crash and burn
I criticize your every word
I'm tryna keep from goin' insane
Ain't that the way of this whole damn thing?
Oh, tryin' to be something more

Nobody's gonna love you if
You can't display a way to capture this
Nobody's gonna hold your hand and guide you through
No, it's up for you to understand
Nobody's gonna feel your pain
When all is done and it's time for you to walk away
So when you have today
You should say all that you have to say

Say all that you have to say
You might also like
Is there a right way for bein' strong?
Feels like I'm doin' things all wrong
Still, I'm here just holdin' on
Confess my heart and forgive my wrongs
Oh, just tryna show you somethin' more

Nobody's gonna love you if
You can't display a way to capture this
Nobody's gonna hold your hand and guide you through
It's up for you to understand
Nobody's gonna feel your pain
When all is done and it's time for you to walk away
So when you have toda
You should say all that you have to say

Don't point the blame when you can't find nothin'
Look to yourself and you might find somethin'
It's time that we sorted out
All of the things we complain about
So listen close to the sound of your soul
Take back a life we led once before
If it ain't you, then who?
If it ain't you, then who's gonna love you?
Oh
Nobody's gonna love you if
You can't display a way to capture this
Nobody's gonna hold your hand and guide you through
It's up for you to understand
Nobody's gonna feel your pain
When all is done and it's time for you to walk away
So when you have today
You should say all that you have to say

So when you have today
