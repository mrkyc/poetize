Yeah
Pack your bags 'cause we got no reason to lay low
What was my line?
Fuck it
Two, three, go
Sing
La-la-la

You always said I'd be a disappointment
That I'd be nothing and I'd probably lose it all
You thought that I would trip and fall
But you'll never see me beg or crawl
Can't take it, won't fake it, punch a hole through the wall, try to break it
Can't change it, rearrange it, so I guess that I'll just have to face it
This is bloody knuckles and I'll show you how to play
It's the only way to escape from all the pain, yeah

We bought a one-way ticket 'cause we're sick of it all
Pack your bags we're going
At the bottom, but we got no reason to lay low
Like you care anyway, no
Here, take one last breath
Take all you can till there's nothing left
We'll never do what you say, no
Until we drop dead, never let go
You might also like
Another day, another disappointment
My head is tripping, might as well just slip away
You all think I'm crazy anyway
You all think I'm crazy
Won't give in, never fit in, it's a knife in the back that you twist in
You dig in, don't pretend, I'm already down, but you keep on pushing
Life is a fight, but you don't ever fight fair
Beat us to the ground, but we will never stay there

We bought a one-way ticket 'cause we're sick of it all
Pack your bags we're going
At the bottom, but we got no reason to lay low
Like you care anyway, no
Here, take one last breath
Take all you can till there's nothing left
We'll never do what you say, no
Until we drop dead, never let go

I won't give in, never fit in
It's a knife in the back that you twist in
This is bloody knuckles, I'll show you how to play
It's the only way to escape from all the pain
Away from all this pain
We bought a one-way ticket 'cause we're sick of it all
Pack your bags we're going
At the bottom, but we got no reason to lay low
Like you care anyway, no
Here, take one last breath
Take all you can till there's nothing left
We'll never do what you say, no
