The lion and the wolf, old gods and the new
Battle of the bastards, trying to break through
A back and forth pendulum we can't seem to stop
Tickin' like a metronome, can't kill the clock
Somedays I feel like we're just symptoms of our system
Blackhole, no hope, psycho syndrome

Hey, feels like we're caged animals, lookin' for the antidote
To break the chains they put us in
Yeah, you can call it cynical, maybe I'm just miserable
But there's no way I'm givin' in
To their lies, I'm gonna fight
And put it all on the line tonight
So light the gas with some matches
Let's burn the old empire into ashes

(Woah, woah)
Let's burn it all into ashes

The young man dreams while he sleeps in his bed
Death keeps an eye while he's waitin' for the dead
If life is a needle, then my soul is the thread
My mouth is the poison, my tongue is the lead
Somedays I feel like I'm just stuck in my own skin
Try to break free, but I can't escape me

(Woah, woah)
Let's burn it all into ashes

(Ooooh-ooh)
Let's turn it all into ashes
Sometimes I feel like we're just symptoms of our system
Blackhole, no hope, psycho syndrome
Psycho syndrome

There's no way I'm giving in
