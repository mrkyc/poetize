I got this new thing
I got a new swing
I'll make you fall to your knees, I'll make your heart sing
I'll turn the lights out
I'm gonna get down
I'll be the new king
I will be your everything

I wanna live fast
I wanna die free
My blood is pumping, why can't you feel my heartbeat?
I got that new sound, and when I come 'round
I'll be your nightmare, I'm comin' for you, don't be scared
Don't be scared, don't be scared, I'm coming for you, don't be scared

Look into my eyes, tell me what do you see?
Don't believe the lies that you've heard about me, about me (About me)
About me
About me (About me)
About me
I know what you're thinkin' and the secrets that you keep
Just don't believe the lies that you heard about me, about me (About me)
About me
About me (About me)
About me, about me
You might also like
I'll drive you insane, life in the fast lane
So hold on tight, we're never coming back again
And there's no free ride, so once you get inside
To play the game, honey, you gotta roll the dice
I could be bad luck, you might be crazy
Yeah, I got nine lives, you only have three
You like my technique, I'm on a winning streak
So watch that pretty mouth before you go and try to speak
Try to speak, try to speak, before you go and try to speak

Look into my eyes, tell me what do you see?
Don't believe the lies that you've heard about me, about me (About me)
About me
About me (About me)
About me (Hey, hey, hey)
I know what you're thinkin' and the secrets that you keep (Woah)

About me (About me)
About me, about me

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, woooah)
I know what you're thinking, I know those secrets that you keep
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't believe the lies that you've heard about me, about me
Look into my eyes, tell me what do you see? (What do you see?)
Don't believe the lies that you've heard about me, about me (About me)
About me
