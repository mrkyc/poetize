Father, father, tell me where have you been?

It's been hell not having you here
I've been missing you so bad
And you don't seem to care
When I go to sleep at night, you're not there
When I go to sleep at night, do you care?

Do you even miss us?
Your bottles, your mistress
I need to know, I need to know

Why are you walking away?
Was it something I did? Did I make a mistake?
'Cause I'm trying to deal with the pain
I don't understand this, is this how it ends?

I will try to understand
(Father, father, father)

Father, father, tell me where are you now?
It's been hell not having you
Last thing I heard, you were fed up
You're skipping town with no note telling where
When I go to sleep at night, you're not there
When I go to sleep at night, do you care?
You might also like
I need to know, I need to know

Why are you walking away?
Was it something I did? Did I make a mistake?
'Cause I'm trying to deal with the pain
I don't understand this, is this how it ends?
Why are you running away?
I don't understand this, is this how it ends?
Why are you running away?
Tell me please, tell me please, I need to know

Is this what you call a family?
Is this what you call a family?
Is this what you call a family?
Is this what you call a family?

It's been seven years wishing that you'd drop a line (Is this what you call a family?)
But I carry the thought along with you in my mind (Is this what you call a family?)
Is this what you call a family? (Is this what you call a family?)
Is this what you call a family? (Is this what you call a family?)
Family!
Why are you walking away?
Was it something I did? Did I make a mistake?
'Cause I'm trying to deal with the pain
I don't understand this, is this how it ends?
Why are you running away?
I don't understand this, is this how it ends?
Why are you running away?
Tell me please, tell me please, I need to know

Is this what you call a family?
