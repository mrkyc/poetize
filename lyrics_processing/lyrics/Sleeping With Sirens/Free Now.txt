I wrote this song for my father
Sometimes, I feel he never gave a damn about me
Though he raised me like he should
Did he understand me? No, no, I don't think so

I wrote this song for my mother
She had to leave me, when I was younger
She said "Son, seek this life and keep an open mind"
But in my mind's eye

I am free now, free to live without my fears
I believe now, there's a reason why I'm here
It's to try and do good
It's to try and do better, oh oh

Who will I be for my daughter?
This little baby, she means the world to me
Will I relive their mistakes or do things the right way
For her sake?

I am free now, free to live without my fears
I believe now, there's a reason why I'm here
Can I be a man, one that understands
How to love more patiently?
I'll be free now, I'll be free now

And we dream of the day when our kids can play
In the streets with no fear of them being taken away
Fathers raise their sons with respect and love
Handle anger and pain with no need for no guns
If we hope to be free, it takes you and me
To start over here and now
'Cause this world is the way it is, it's how we raise our kids

I wrote this song for my mother
Wrote this song for our father
So hopefully, we can come together
And hopefully, make things a little better

I am free now, free to live without my fears
I believe now, there's a reason why I'm here
Can I be a man, one that understands
How to love more patiently?
I am free now, I am free now
