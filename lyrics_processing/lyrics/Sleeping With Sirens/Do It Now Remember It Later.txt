Seen this place before back when I was young
And I had something more to prove
Now that I'm older, I've seen all the things that I want
And I'm ready to make my move

We'll stare straight-faced, don't hesitate
See, why would we want to make you bastards wait?
Thank god, I got this chance, now I can say
So now we'll say, we'll say
We're gonna do what we want

Remember when they said that what we want can never be done?
When it all comes falling down, we'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to, yeah, yeah, yeah
Remember when they said that what we want can never be done?
Well look who's laughing now, we'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh

Oh my, don't they hate to see us try
Come on, say what you think, it won't mean a thing
In the end we're gonna be just fine

We'll stare straight-faced, don't hesitate
See, why would we want to make you bastards wait?
Thank god, I got this chance, now I can say
So now we'll say, we'll say
We're gonna do what we want

Remember when they said that what we want can never be done?
When it all comes falling down, we'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to, yeah, yeah, yeah
Remember when they said that what we want can never be done?
Well look who's laughing now, we'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to, yeah, yeah, yeah

We'll do what we want right now
Come on, come on
With or without you
We got a brand-new prospective
Don't you cross the line
Don't you cross that line
We'll do what we want
Right now, come on, come on
With or without you
Don't you cross the line
Don't you cross that line
