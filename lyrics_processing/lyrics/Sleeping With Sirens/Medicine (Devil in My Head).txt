I've been up all night staring at the ceiling
Choking on the medicine that I keep drinking
'Round and 'round, up and down
'Round and 'round, up and down
People talking in my ear, can't hear what they're sayin'
Swimming in the fire, the walls keep spinning
'Round and 'round, up and down
'Round and 'round, up and down

I keep lying to myself, now it's too late
The monster's inside, the monster is me
I keep lying to myself, now it's too late
The monster's inside, the monster is me

The devil's living in my head, I'm scared to death
I haven't been myself lately
If I were you, I wouldn't get too close
'Cause I don't know what I'd do if you push me

Start another fight, make a fist, keep swinging
Alone in the dark, what the hell was I thinking?
'Round and 'round, up and down
'Round and 'round, up and down
I'm upside down, God, I hate the feeling
Lying on the floor, at the door she's leaving
'Round and 'round, up and down
'Round and 'round, up and down
You might also like
I keep lyin' to myself, now it's too late
The monster's inside, the monster is me
I keep lyin' to myself, now it's too late
The monster's inside, the monster is me

The devil's living in my head, I'm scared to death
I haven't been myself lately
If I were you, I wouldn't get too close
'Cause I don't know what I'd do if you push me

Someone save me now
I haven't been myself lately
I keep falling down
So don't push me, don't push me, don't push me
(Start another fight, make a fist, keep swinging
Make a fist, keep swing-)

The devil's living in my head, I'm scared to death
I haven't been myself lately
If I were you, I wouldn't get too close
So don't push me, don't push me, don't push me
The devil's living in my head, I'm scared to death
I haven't been myself lately
If I were you (If I were you), I wouldn't get too close
'Cause I don't know what I'd do if you push me

Someone save me now
I haven't been myself lately
I keep falling down
So don't push me, don't push me, don't push me

The devil's living in my head, my head
I don't know what I'd do if you push me
Devil's living in my head
I don't know what I'd do if you push me
