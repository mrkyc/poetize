Could you check my pulse for me to see if I'm alive?
'Cause every time that I am near you is the only time I feel alright
If there were any way I could think to turn back time
I'd stay here with you
Sometimes I sit and wonder, sometimes I feel like letting go
All I know is no one should have to be alone

I don't want to be alone
I don't want to die alone (No one should have to die alone)
I could fall apart here and now
I don't want to die alone

I want to be with you, you, you (With you)
I only want to be with you, you, you
(With you, with you, with you, with you) Uh, uh, uh

Tell me, what's the point of life, is it material?
Had everything I could ever want and probably more
When I lay in bed at night, all I do is think of you
So when all this is gone, what do I have to come home to?
This life goes by so fast, pretty soon, I'll grow old
What would I have but some stories now that I have told?
No one to share them with, and when it's all done
What am I left with? Tell me what's left!

Leave me? How the fuck you gonna leave me?
When I'm the one that's on TV with these girls screaming outside with my CD?
And I'm begging? Naw baby, you're the one that can't keep me
Leave me? Girl, how the fuck you gonna leave me? Huh?
You know I love you, when we fight and we argue
I kiss and I hug you, you push me back, you say that I'm trouble
But every Bonnie got a Clyde with her
Every woman needs somebody that's gon' ride with her
Yeah, and I can't go on staying alive if I'm alone
Pick up the phone and say hello, I'd rather die with her
Now my night's so cold, when your heart is frozen, mine's exposed you know this
Try to blame the fame for the way I've changed and you know those claims are bogus
Baby, it's not me, it's us, maybe now all we need is trust
Maybe this Hennessey will solve our problems, baby, pick it up

I don't want to be alone
I don't want to die alone (No one should have to die alone)
I could fall apart here and now
I don't want to die alone (No one should have to die alone)
I don't want to be alone
I don't want to die alone (No one should have to die alone)
I could fall apart here and now
I don't want to die alone
