Life is walking on a tight rope
With nothing but a blindfold
It's a long way, it's a long way down
I'm, yeah, I'm a little crazy
But can you really blame me?
It's a long way, it's a long way down

For every step that I take
I take two steps back
It's like a punch to the face
It's like a knife right in the
(Knife right in the, knife right in the, knife right in the)

It's like a knife right in the back
Like a bullet to the head
Why can't I understand?
The blood is on my hands
Now I'm standing on the edge
With nowhere to go (To go)
This is how it feels, this is how it feels
How it feels to be
Lost, lost

I've been stranded in an ocean
Treading water but it's hopeless, hopeless
It's a long way, it's a long way down
Why am I always on the brink of
Losing it all? Am I just wasting my time?
It's a long way, it's a long way down

For every step that I take
I take two steps back
It's like a punch to the face

It's like a knife right in the back
Like a bullet to the head
Why can't I understand?
The blood is on my hands
Now I'm standing on the edge
With nowhere to go (To go)
This is how it feels, this is how it feels
How it feels to be
Lost, lost, lost

And it's a long way down (It's a long way down)
And it's a long way down (Long way down)
Why do I do this to myself?
Why do I put myself through hell?
And will I ever understand
The blood is on my hands?
(Knife right in the, knife right in the, knife right in the)
It's like a knife right in the back
Like a bullet to the head
Why can't I understand
The blood is on my hands?
Now I'm standing on the edge
With nowhere to go (To go)
This is how it feels, this is how it feels
How it feels to be
Lost, lost
How it feels to be
