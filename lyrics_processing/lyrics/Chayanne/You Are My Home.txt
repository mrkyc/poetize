I've been searching
For someone to find me
I have been looking
Waiting for your arms
To hold me
You took me
In from the cold
And out of the dark
You have taken me
Into your heart
You are my home
You are the one that I come to
You are the shelter I run to
To keep me safe from the cold
You are my home
You are the love
That completes me
You are the touch
That has freed me
I look in your eyes
And I know
You're my home
You're my home
You were the light in the window
When I couldn't find my way
You led my heart to
A warm tender place
Here beside you
