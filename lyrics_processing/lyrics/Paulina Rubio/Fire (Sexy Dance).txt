I wanna play with fire

Even in the pouring rain
Even in the stars above
I'm here with you again
Even if we're not in love
We'll dance together in the dark
I know how to light the spark
I'm burning up with my desire
I wanna play with fire
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I wanna play with fire
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Guess this is where it all begins
When we let the music play
Wanna drag me in
Taste me like champagne
And let your hands go everywhere
On my body through my hair
Your moves are so amazing
You know it makes me crazy
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I wanna play with fire
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I wanna play with fire
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Don't stop it, no
Surrender to the beat just you and me
Just like it used to be
Set your heart free when you surrender
Don't stop it, no
'Cause I can feel the heat of you and me
Just like it used to be
Set your heart free when you surrender

I can barely breathe
I can not believe
There's only you and me
Moving, desperately
Suddenly dance the dance
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (El beso)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (Otro beso)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (Nada se compara)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (Only you to me)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (Nothing means more to me)
And when we can't get enough
And history repeats
I only hear the sounds
Of your voice echoing
We'll do it all again somehow
Because it feels so good
We'll do the things that
Everybody else wishes that they could
Don't stop it, no
Surrender to the beat just you and me
Just like it used to be
Set your heart free when you surrender
Don't stop it, no
'Cause I can feel the heat of you and me
Just like it used to be
