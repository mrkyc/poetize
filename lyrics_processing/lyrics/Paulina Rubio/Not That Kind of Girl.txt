I know you're gonna change the way you think of me
And so I'm gonna show you how it supposed to be
I'm gonna finally make you see
I'm gonna make you learn your lesson with me

'Cause I'm not the kind of girl who will lay down at your feet
Pedal back for your love, come whenever you call me
And I won't wait around and I won't be your shadow
Lost in a world (lost in a world) 'cause I'm not that kind of girl

You don't even know what love is all about (you don't know what it's all about)
I won't hang around til you figured it out (figure it out)
I'm gonna finally make you see
I'm gonna make you learn your lesson with me

'Cause I'm not the kind of girl that will stand in a shadow
Pedal back for your love, let you win every battle
Just to keep you around, just to make you feel better
You can be sure (you can be sure)
That I'm not the kind of girl who will lay down at your feet
Pedal back for your love, come whenever you call me
'Cause that's not what I need, and that's not thw way that
I see the world (I see the world)

Pedal back for your love, come whenever you call me

No, you're not the one for me, no, and I'll never have to let you go
'Cause I'm more than that girl in the shadow - I'm telling ya
'Cause I'm not the kind of girl who will lay down at your feet
Beg for your love, come whenever you call me
And you'll never see me cry
No, you'll never see me cry, no, no, no; and you're never gonna break me, no, no
Cause I'm never gonna be what you want me to, I know for sure
