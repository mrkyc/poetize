The streets are big and empty ever since you left me
I really hate to say that nothing's good for me, it seems I haven't seen you lately
The day without you pass me, the hours and minutes blast me
They're the coldest reminder of the bitter hole you left here in my heart

If you've been good to me, baby, I'll consider it and maybe
I can still losing my heart and my soul over you, oh, but never my head
I swore my love was true, looking through tears in my eyes
But I promise to you this is gonna be finally the last goodbye
The last goodbye

Even if you come to beg me, to forgive you, you won't make me
Even if I see you crying, you'll still probably be lying
Even if it causes me pain, I've already thrown off your chains
And I swear that this rancheras gonna be the last goodbye
Even if you come to plead, begging on your hands and knees
Even if I see you crying, you'll still probably be lying
Even if you say that you've changed, I'm still throwin off this cruel chains
And I swear that this rancheras gonna be the last goodbye
