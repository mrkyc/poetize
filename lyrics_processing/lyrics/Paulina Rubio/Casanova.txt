Dark sexy skin my passion begins
You're the center of my obsession
I'm watching you dance in your leather pants
My eyes see a true perfection
And I'm hypnotized by the rhythm of your hips
It's all hard to hide and I can't resist

It's about your kiss, It's about your lips
It's about the way you move your body
It's about your style that drives me wild
It's the sexy things you're doin'
Come and dance with me tonight
Feel the rhythm deep inside
Touch me now!
You can be my Casanova
It's about your kiss, It's about your lips
It's about the way you move your body
It's about your style that drives me wild
It's the sexy things you're doin'
Come and dance with me tonight
Feel the rhythm deep inside
Touch me now!
You can be my Casanova
