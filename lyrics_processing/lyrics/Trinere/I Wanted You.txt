Hello?
Yo, this is Sloan. Can I come over?
Hmm, can you come over?
Hello?
Let it hit 'em
Let it hit 'em
Let it hit 'em
Let it hit 'em
Now we're kickin' it with Trinere
I got your call at half past nine
And I knew if you'd come over
We could have a real good time
To hear your voice brings back memories
Of you and I together, lost in ecstasy
(Let it hit 'em)
But still, I must be strong
I got to hold on
Gotta say no to you
And all the things you do
See, I can't give in
I can't let you win
Babe, I just can't see you again
You know I
You might also likeI wanted you tonight
(But you wouldn't do me right)
You wouldn't do me right
(I wanted you)
I wanted you tonight
(But you wouldn't do me right)
To touch me, hold me, squeeze me
All through the night
I tell myself I could find someone new
I could search the whole world over
And never find a love like you
My love will never, ever die
But I can't see my forever in your lying eyes
(Let it hit 'em)
But still I must be strong
I got to hold on
Gotta say no to you
And all the things you do
See, I can't give in
I can't let you win
'Cause you'll wind up
Breaking my heart again
I wanted you tonight
(But you wouldn't do me right)
You wouldn't do me right
(I wanted you)
I wanted you tonight
(But you wouldn't do me right)
To touch me, hold me, squeeze me
All through the night
(You're sweet as can be)
I wanted you tonight
(But you keep hurting me)
But you wouldn't do me right
(I wanted you)
I wanted you tonight
(But you weren't someone true)
To touch me, hold me, squeeze me
All through the night

Hello?
Yo, this is Sloan. Can I come over?
Hmm, can you come over?
Hello? Hello?
Trinere, give me just one more chance, my dear
'Cause losing your tender love I fear
And I'm walking around in a daze
Like a paperback novel
Turn me to the next page, let me know
Can I get next to you tonight
So I can rub your body right
And whisper in your ear?
Livin's getting busy and we're kicking it with Trinere
I wanted you tonight
But you wouldn't do me right
(You wouldn't do me right)
I wanted you tonight
To touch me, hold me, squeeze me
All through the night
(Let it hit 'em)
I got to hold on
I got to hold on
And we're kickin' it with Trinere
But still I must be strong
I got to hold on
Gotta say no to you
And all the things you do
(Let it hit 'em)
See, I can't give in
I can't let you win
Babe, I just can't see you again
You know I
I wanted you tonight
(But you wouldn't do me right)
But you wouldn't do me right
(You're sweet as can be)
I wanted you tonight
(But you keep hurtin' me)
To touch me, hold me, squeeze me
All through the night
(Don't come knockin' on my door)
I wanted you tonight
(I ain't seeing you no more, no more)
(No more now, baby)
But you wouldn't do me right
