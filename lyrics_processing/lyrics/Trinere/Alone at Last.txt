Why don't you listen to this recording with interest?
Eyes so funky
Are you ready?

We should be together, picture you and I
We could have each other and this dream will never die
And, boy, I really never will ever by my side
Lovin' everlastin', won't you stay with me tonight?
Tell me how you love me, tell me what you need
Baby, you can trust me 'cause your secret's safe with me

Alone at last I reach for you
You know that I love you
Know that I want you too
A dream for real, so true
You know that I love you
Know that I want you too

Following my footsteps
You know you'll never lose me cause i'm giving you a hand
And boy i know a place where we can get away
Hold on to each other and we'll seal this secret place
Burning like a fire oh so deep within
Boy you give me something that i'll never know again
Baby don't forget me remember all the times
Promise me you'll keep me in the corner of your mind

You know that i love you
Know that i want you too
A dream for real, so true
You know that i love you
Know that i want you too
(male rap)
Baby baby i do adore ya
Love ya so much i'll do anything for ya
Thinking back, seeing it go like this
Us holding hands walking on sand as we kiss
Too much attraction, kiss of passion
Strong reaction, lots of action
Even now, i can't forget about the past
We're alone at last
You know how to love me, like no one has before
You've got what i need and you give me so much more
Boy now i hear you calling, voices in the wind
I look into your eyes, i'm in love once again
Alone at last i reach for you
You know that i love you
Know that i want you too
A dream for real, so true
You know that i love you
