Can't stop the beat
You caught my eyes from across the floor
Could you be the one that I am looking for?
I wanna get to know you if I could
'Cause the way you move your body looks so good
I feel the music pumpin' through my heart
All this love that has begun to start
Don't turn away and leave me in the dark
Got to have your love 'cause I just
Can't stop the beat in my heart
I can't stop the beat in my heart
I really want you, baby, can't you see?
I've got a feeling you're the man for me
Just take me in your arms for one last dance
I'm sure with me, you'll find a sweet romance
I feel the music pumpin' through my heart
All this love that has begun to start
Don't turn away and leave me in the dark
Got to have your love 'cause I just
