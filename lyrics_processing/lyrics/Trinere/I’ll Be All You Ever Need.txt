You're confused, so I'm waiting
So why don't you
Come make your move on me?
The feelings you hide
I feel deep inside when you're near
We're both in a crowd
You're thinking aloud and I hear
You can't deny (no, no, no, no, no)
What's in your eyes (what's in your eyes)
In your eyes
It's plain to see
(You know it's plain to see)
You want to be (you wanna be)
My guy
I'll be all you ever need
Satisfaction guaranteed
If you give me half a chance
I'll be your girl
I'll be all you ever need
Satisfaction guaranteed
If you give me half a chance
I'll rock your world

It's the same old thing, incomplete
Thoughts are all you bring, so, boy, reveal
What is on your mind
(What's on your mind?)
You're so insecure
But I'll make you sure with my love
And when I am done
I'll be the one you think of
You can't deny
(No, no-no-no-no, no, no, no)
What's in your eyes (what's in your eyes)
In your eyes
It's plain to see (it's plain to see)
You want to be (you wanna be)
My guy
I'll be all you ever need
Satisfaction guaranteed
If you give me half a chance
I'll be your girl
You know I'll be all you ever need
Satisfaction guaranteed
If you give me half a chance
I'll rock your world
Get it, boy
I'll be all you ever need
All you ever need
I'll be all you ever need
My love is always guaranteed
I know what you need
I'll be all you need
You can't deny
What's in your eyes
