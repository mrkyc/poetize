Find out, what's there, something new you can see
Get up get down get a little bit closer to me
Find out what's there what you can be
Yesterday was our time to turn back again
And instead we went through the fire to get lost in sin
Burn baby burn let me cool you down again
Turn baby turn to see where it all begins
Cause it's alright it's out there
Go and get lost girl
It's alright I'm out there
Let me take control
Get up get down move a little bit closer to the scene
Find out, what's there, something new you can see there
Get up get down get a little bit closer to me, girl
Find out what's there what you can be
Walking over tv on
Let it take control love
Every side inside your body each and every bone
Burn baby burn let's cool it down again
Turn baby turn to see where it all begins
