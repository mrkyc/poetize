You're as perfect as you've ever been
In that sweater, you've been livin' in
Can you see it? 'Cause I see it
Windows down goin' 85
I look over and catch your eye
Can you feel it? 'Cause I feel it

There's a rush of blood when you go this fast
When you're up against it, I got your back
They say that good things just don't last
But I'll say this

Every little fork in the road
Never feel my hand letting go
If I did, you know I'm running back
You and me, we've got a love like
Two names on a tree
Sure as every breath that you breathe
Every beat is like a heart attack
You and me, we've got a love like
That

Love like
That
You might also like
Like that one thing that won't ever change
When I lose my head, you say my name
When I need it
Yeah, I need it

'Cause we got this thing that I can't describe
Like I fell for you in another life
And I'd fall again a thousand times
And I mean it, yeah, I mean it

Every little fork in the road
Never feel my hand letting go
If I did, you know I'm running back
You and me, we've got a love like
Two names on a tree
Sure as every breath that you breathe
Every beat is like a heart attack
You and me, we've got a love like
That

Love like that
You and me, we've got a love like that
Yeah, if you keep runnin', I'll keep runnin' (Woo)
I don't know what's comin', but I know one thing

Every little fork in the road
Never feel my hand letting go
If I did, you know I'm running back
You and me, we've got a love like
Two names on a tree
Sure as every breath that you breathe (Aw, yeah)
Every beat is like a heart attack (Yeah, I know it is)
You and me, we've got a love like (We got a love like)
That (Got love like)

Love like (We got a love like)
That
