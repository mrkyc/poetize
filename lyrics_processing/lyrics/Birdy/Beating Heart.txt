There's a beating in your heart
That takes you everywhere
Will take you anywhere
You've been reaching in the dark
Like there's no one there
You think there's no one there

You've been trying too hard
Trying to start
It takes time, don't lose yourself
Don't keep fighting your heart
Stay as you are
Don't change for anyone else

Say it strong
Lay it all on me
You don't have to be
Afraid of what you think you're not, you'll see
Say it wrong
Let the words run free
I know what you mean
And you'll find someone who loves you just as much as me

You're afraid of coming last

You think you'll never get there

You've been trying too hard
Trying to start

Don't keep fighting your heart
Stay as you are
