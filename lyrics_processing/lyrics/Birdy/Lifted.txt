Bound to this lonely road
You gave me hope
Gave me hope
Woke my drifting soul
And led me home
Led me home

Won't you just stay here?
Chase away my fears
Solve my mysteries
Won't you just stay here?
Chase away my fears
Set my spirit free

Won't you lead the way
Through my darker days?
Keep them softly spoken
(Keep them softly spoken)
Show me the way
To a brighter place
Keep my eyes from closing
(Keep my eyes from closing)
Oo
Lifted away from my demons
Eh yeah eh yeah, eh yeah eh yeah
Oo
Lifted away from my secrets
Eh yeah eh yeah, eh yeah eh yeah

Oh, my heavy bones
They weigh me down
Weigh me down
Held by a single thread
When you are gone
When you're gone

Won't you just stay here?
Chase away my fears
Solve my mysteries

Won't you lead the way
Through my darker days?
Keep them softly spoken
(Keep them softly spoken)
Show me the way
To a brighter place
Keep my eyes from closing
(Keep my eyes from closing)
Oo
Lifted away from my demons
Eh yeah eh yeah, eh yeah eh yeah
Oo
Lifted away from my secrets
Eh yeah eh yeah, eh yeah eh yeah
If you start to fade
I will keep you safe
Like you do
And if you feel afraid
I will keep your faith
Like you do

Won't you lead the way
Through my darker days?
Keep them softly spoken
(Keep them softly spoken)
Show me the way
To a brighter place
Keep my eyes from closing

Oo
Lifted away from my demons
