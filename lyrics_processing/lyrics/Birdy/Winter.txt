It's so cold, baby, it's dark outside
Winter comes creeping in through the night
And it's so hard when I just wanna hold you tight
Breaks my heart, but nothing can break this ice

Hold on, hold on
Baby, just be strong

And I will be honest and let you go
This is the reason and you should know
Through all that you promise, I can see
None of your dreams ever have time for me
So this is the reason I let you go
And I will be honest and you should know
Through all that you promise, I can see
None of your dreams ever have time for me

And it's so quiet, baby, it's hard to breathe
Black as ink, the silence is deafening
And it's so hard to look into distant eyes
And feel your heart slowly tie away from mine

So long, so long
Baby, you're long gone

And I will be honest and let you go
This is the reason and you should know
Through all that you promise, I can see
None of your dreams ever have time for me
So this is the reason I let you go
I will be honest and you should know
Through all that you promise, I can see
None of your dreams ever have time for me
