That's right, pleased to meet you
I still won't tell you my name
Don't you believe in mystery
Don't you want to play my game
I'm lookin' for a man to love me
Like I've never been loved before
I'm lookin' for a man that'll do it anywhere
Even on a limousine floor

'Cause tonight I'm livin' in a fantasy
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me?
Do you think I'm a nasty girl?
Tonight, I'm livin' in a fantasy
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't you want to come with me?
Do you think I'm a nasty girl?

I guess I'm just used to sailors
I think they got water on the brain
I think they got more water upstairs
Than they got sugar on a candy cane
That's right, it's been a long time
Since I had a man that did it real good
If you ain't scared, take it out
I'll do it like a real live nasty girl should

I don't like this groove
Try and give me something I can croon to
Catch my drift?
That'll work


That's right, I can't control it
I need seven inches or more
Tonight, I can no longer hold it
Get it up, get it up, I can't wait anymore

Uh, it's time to jam
Dance, nasty girls, dance
