My lips start shaking when I see him walking down the street
Of all the boys at school, he's the only one I wanna meet
If he combs his hair, all my girlfriends start to scream
He's so clean, he's the number-one star of my wet dream

I get so angry if I see him with another dame
I start to tremble and I don't even know his name
If he takes her to the soda shop, guess who's gonna buy the ice cream?
She gives him all her money 'cause he's the star of her wet dream

Can't help it, can't help it, can't help it
Ooh, honey, honey, boy's so fine
I can't help it, can't help it, can't help it
Ooh, honey, honey, gotta, gotta make him mine

My body starts to quiver when I think of his next to mine
I know he could deliver the dam to the river anytime
He's so good-looking, he's the cutest dude I've ever seen
He's my little lover, number one star of my wet dream

Can't help it, can't help it, can't help it
Ooh, honey, honey, boy's so fine
I can't help it, can't help it, can't help it
Ooh, honey, honey, gotta, gotta make him mine, yeah
