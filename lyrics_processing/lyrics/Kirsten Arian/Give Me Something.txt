Give me something to die for
Give me something, and I'll shed my blood
Give me something to die for
I've been waiting with a bow and an arrow
I've been listening to the rhythm in my head
I've been waiting for the sound of the trumpet

I got a message, a message in a bottle, but
You won't listen, you sit around and wallow
In your own grief
In your own temptation
If you'd let me, I could show you salvation
You walk around with your hands over your eyes
And your fingers in your ears
Screaming, "L-L-L-Lies!"
No, you won't listen to the truth
If there's an alter, the bride has left her groom

Give me something to die for
Give me something to shed my blood
Give me something to die for

I've been listening to the rhythm in my head
I've been waiting for the sound of the trumpet
Oh, give me something to die for
Give me something, and I'll shed my blood
Give me something to die for
'Cause I've been waiting with a bow and an arrow
I've been listening to the rhythm in my head
I've been waiting for the sound of the trumpet

We were something He died for
We were something, and He shed His blood
We were something He died for
He's been waiting at the right of the Father
He's been listening to the rhythm in His head
He's been waiting for the sound of the trumpet
Oh, give me something
Give me something
Give me something
Give me something
Give me, give me something
Give me something
Give me, give me something
Give me something
Give me, give me something
Give me something
Give me, give me something
Give me something
Give me, give me something
Give me something
Give me, give me something
Give me something
Give me, give me something
Give me something
