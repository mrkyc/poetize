You got me good
You took me for a ride
Showed me the bright lights
Bound me with your lies
I should be running for my life
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes it's not right
I know I can do better
There's parts of me you'll hold forever

But I gave you one more chance
And I watched you light a match
And burn it down
I gave you one more chance
And you lit a match
And burnt it down
Down, down, down, down

You left without a single regret, and
I'm left with all these broken pieces
And I hope you'll find some happiness
Hope you know I will too
You might also likeWith or without you
With or without you

You got me good
I'm sitting here alone
With all of my regrets
And all of the past tense
I should have done what I was told
But you tasted like sugar
And sent me on a rush
Now I know, next time I'll do better
I love the ones who last forever

But I gave you one more chance
And I watched you light a match
And burn it down
I gave you one more chance
And you lit a match
And burnt it down
Down, down, down, down
You left without a single regret, and
I'm left with all these broken pieces
And I hope you'll find some happiness
Hope you know I will too
With or without you
With or without you

I'm rising up now
Taking back the ground
Dusting my feet off
Cleaning the mess up
Oh, I see clearly
No, I'm not crying
I gave my everything, my everything
My everything, my everything
And oh, was it enough?
Oh, was it enough for you?

'Cause you left without a single regret, and
I'm left with all these broken pieces
And I hope you'll find some happiness
Hope you know I will too
With or without you
With or without you
With or without you
