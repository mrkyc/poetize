Honey I, I, I
Honey I, I, I
Honey I, I, I, I

I got no time, you see
You just keep waiting on me
But it was wrong back then
And it's still wrong my friend
I felt your eyes hit mine
It felt like wasting time
But I still love you so
Honey I, honey I, honey I
Just gotta let go

I thought you were good, but
You're only good for someone else
And if I bite it, I
End up only hurting myself
And you're so tricky
You play the games you know you'll win
And I get dizzy
Then we start all over again
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You might also like
Don't you even pull me close
I'm like a moth to your flame
And we both know how that goes

I got no time, you see
You just keep waiting on me
But it was wrong back then
And it's still wrong my friend
I felt your eyes hit mine
It felt like wasting time
But I still love you so
Honey I, honey I, honey I
Just gotta let go

I know I sound crazy
It's just there's too much to be done
And you distract me
Poison me like heroin
And it feels good
To walk in the waters of your oceans
Keeps me confused
Keeps me feeling numb
Oh, don't you even pull me close
I'm like a moth to your flame
And we both know how that goes

I got no time, you see
You just keep waiting on me
But it was wrong back then
And it's still wrong my friend
I felt your eyes hit mine
It felt like wasting time
But I still love you so
Honey I, honey I, honey I
(Just gotta let go)
Honey I, honey I, honey I
(Just gotta let go)
Honey I, honey I, honey I
(I gotta let go)
Honey I, honey I, honey I
