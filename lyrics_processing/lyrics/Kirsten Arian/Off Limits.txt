If it were up to me
Babe, I'd better be
Blowing up your phone
Laughing at your jokes
Calling you over
You're such a good man
You've got good intentions
You love me so well
Give me life and still
Put me back together

But oh
Oh, I know
Now I want you even more
We came close
If only I could run my fingers through your hair
Whisper in your ear
Take you by the hand
Let you know I care, but it's true

You're off-limits, and I can't have you
You might also like
I'm fighting too hard
You make me see stars
I love it when you rap
You're getting me off track
I was just doing just fine
We'd be the good ones
We'll never be one
Wish it wasn't so
Baby, now I know
I didn't get you this time

But oh
Oh, I know
Now I want you even more
We came close
If only I could run my fingers through your hair
Whisper in your ear
Take you by the hand
Let you know I care, but it's true

You're off-limits, and I can't have you
I can't have you, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
No, oh, oh

And I just can't get you out of my head
Never even started, now it's come to an end
Bet you never noticed, baby, we were just friends
I fell hard
I tried to give you my heart
I like to get what I want, want, want, want, want
And I just can't get you out of my head
Never even started, now it's come to an end
Bet you never noticed, baby, we were just friends
I fell hard
I tried to give you my heart
I like to get what I want, want, want, want, want
And I just can't get you out of my head
Never even started, now it's come to an end
Bet you never noticed, baby, we were just friends
I fell hard
I tried to give you my heart
I like to get what I want
And now I'm here, and you're not, not, not, not
I'm here and you're not
I'm here and you're not
I'm here and you're not, not, not, not, not
I'm here and you're not

But oh
Oh, I know
Now I want you even more
We came close
If only I could run my fingers through your hair
Whisper in your ear
Take you by the hand
Let you know I care, but it's true

You're off-limits, and I can't have you
Oh, oh, oh
I can't have you
