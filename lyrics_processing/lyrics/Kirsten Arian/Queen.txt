Tell me, tell me baby
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I've seen you staring lately
I guess you don't know me
I guess you don't know me

But the veil's coming off
The curtains arise
And I can see, see it all
No use in disguising
Who you are, what you are
A wolf in sheep's cloak
And take it off

They call you a beast
And we ate out of your hands
It was out of my hands
You came in like a prince
And pulled us in with a dance
Thought I didn't stand a chance
You might also likeBut I got something you don't know about me
I'm smarter than you think
I've got something you don't know about me
I don't need your royalty
You're a prince, but I'm a queen

And I know all about you
I've seen those eyes before
You've told those lies, I'm sure
And everyone's been talking
They think you're so much fun
I think you're a cowardly one
But I'm not gonna run

They call you a beast
And we ate out of your hands
It was out of my hands
You came in like a prince
And pulled us in with a dance
Thought I didn't stand a chance
But I got something you don't know about me
I'm smarter than you think
I've got something you don't know about me
I don't need your royalty
You're a prince, but I'm a queen
But the veil's coming off
The curtains arise
And I can see, see it all
No use in disguising
Who you are, what you are
A wolf in sheep's cloak
And take it off
Oh the veil's coming off
The curtains arise
And I can see, see it all
No use in disguising
Who you are, what you are
A wolf in sheep's cloak
And take it off

They call you a beast
And we ate out of your hands
It was out of my hands
You came in like a prince
And pulled us in with a dance
Thought I didn't stand a chance
But I got something you don't know about me
I'm smarter than you think
I've got something you don't know about me
I don't need your royalty
