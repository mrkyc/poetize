Oh, you look good tonight
You look good in that smile
My eyes are bright
Hope you notice my my my my
Heart beats fast
I keep catching my breath
You're glorious
I can barely stand

But I love it when

I love it when you pull me under
Under your water
Go and take me deeper
I love it when you get my hands up
Turn me 'round, and don't stop
Your love is sweeter
Only you get me going the way that you do
I'm higher than heaven just looking at you
Pull me in, keep me close
Keep on singing my name
'Cause I'm higher than, higher than, higher than heaven
You might also likeHigher than heaven

Oh, I feel good tonight
I feel good in your arms
You hold me tight
Keep me safe from my my my
Myself, I know
I'm my worst enemy
But with you by my side
I'll be wild and totally free

But I love it when

I love it when you pull me under
Under your water
Go and take me deeper
I love it when you get my hands up
Turn me 'round, and don't stop
Your love is sweeter
Only you get me going the way that you do
I'm higher than heaven just looking at you
Pull me in, keep me close
Keep on singing my name
'Cause I'm higher than, higher than, higher than heaven
I'm higher than heaven

Only you get me going the way that you do
I'm higher than heaven
You get me going the way that you do
And I'm higher than heaven
You get me going the way that you do
And I'm higher than heaven
You get me going the way that you do
And I'm higher than heaven

You get me going the way that you do
I'm higher than heaven just looking at you
Pull me in, keep me close
Keep on singing my name
'Cause I'm higher than, higher than, higher than heaven
Higher than heaven
