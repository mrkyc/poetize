I won't be anybody's second best
I'm your first class
You should know that, know that
I won't be anybody's "maybe"
You can chase me
I was born to be wild and free

You thought I'd wait around, like
All sad face in the ground, but
Baby, take a look at me now
So high, so fly, just try to catch me
You thought I'd fall to pieces
Like you're the one I needed
Baby, take a look at me now
So high, so fly, just try to catch me

(Oh, oh, oh, ooh) Try to catch me
(Oh, oh, oh, ooh) Try to catch me
(Oh, oh, oh, ooh) Try to catch me
I was born to be wild and free

Let's paint the picture now, so you can see
Got my crew with me
You should know that, know that
When we roll in, we tend to cause a scene
We get crazy
We were born to be wild and free
You might also like
You thought I'd wait around, like
All sad face in the ground, but
Baby, take a look at me now
So high, so fly, just try to catch me
You thought I'd fall to pieces
Like you're the one I needed
Baby, take a look at me now
So high, so fly, just try to catch me

(Oh, oh, oh, ooh) Try to catch me
(Oh, oh, oh, ooh) Try to catch me
(Oh, oh, oh, ooh) Try to catch me
I was born to be wild and free

Run 'til morning comes
No one's stopping us
We'll catch the sun
And glitter while we're young
We'll touch the sky
With the stars inside our eyes
I'm not worried 'bout a thing
I was born to be wild and free
(Oh, oh, oh, ooh) Try to catch me
(Oh, oh, oh, ooh) Try to catch me
(Oh, oh, oh, ooh) Try to catch me
I was born to be wild and free
I was born to be wild
I was born to be wild
I was born to be wild
I was born to be wild and free
I was born to be wild
I was born to be wild
I was born to be wild
I was born to be wild and free
I was born to be wild (I was born, I was born, I was born)
I was born to be wild
I was born to be wild
I was born to be wild and free
I was born to be wild (You can try, you can try, you can try)
I was born to be wild
I was born to be wild
