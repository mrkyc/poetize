I've been trying not to step on your toes
Every time I move, feels like I'm the one who loses
And I wonder if our love's just for show
Tell me, "You do you," least until it's inconvenient
But you used to like
When I cross the line
Now you're uncomfortable
When I speak my mind

That's your dilemma, your dilemma
If you don't like what I do, then forget ya
Your dilemma, your dilemma

And I know that you assume I work for you
But tell me, who got me where I am right now?
So I'm not gonna fake it
It's a waste of time
Come along if you get it
Please don't make me choose
I'll tell the truth
If you don't approve
Well that's your dilemma
Your dilemma
You might also like
There's just way too many people to please
And I tried 'em all, couldn't do it, it's impossible
When they all think they know what you need
Try to take control, but that's not rock 'n' roll

That's your dilemma, your dilemma
If you don't like what I do, then forget ya
Your dilemma, your dilemma

And I know that you assume I work for you
But tell me, who got me where I am right now?
So I'm not gonna fake it
It's a waste of time
Come along if you get it
Please don't make me choose
I'll tell the truth
If you don't approve
Well that's your dilemma
Your dilemma

But you used to like
When I cross the line
Now you're uncomfortable
When I speak my mind
So I'm gonna speak my mind

And I know that you assume I work for you
But tell me, who got me where I am right now?
So I'm not gonna fake it
It's a waste of time
Come along if you get it
Please don't make me choose
I'll tell the truth
If you don't approve
Well that's your dilemma
