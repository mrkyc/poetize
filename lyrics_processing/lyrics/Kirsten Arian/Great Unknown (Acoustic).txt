Riding with the top down
We go, we go all out
Tell me if you're ready
Or not
Put your hand on my heart
Promise me forever
Hundred miles an hour
Don't stop

You heard I like the fast lane
Wreck this, I won't be tamed
Got me for eternity tonight
Let me take you past the stars
Show you light inside the dark
Give you magic when it's hard
Oh you know, I'll be your great unknown
You might also like
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I'll be your great unknown

Breathin' in the cool air
Laughin' like we don't care
I'm already head over heels
Drink me down like water
Burnin' me like fire
Hold me, take me higher
I wanna feel

Every cell in my being
Tethered with your body
We can turn the wind into rain
We'll go past the stars
See the light inside the dark
We got magic, we got sparks
Oh you know, I'll be your great unknown
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I'll be your great unknown
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh

Run with me
And I'll show you, baby, baby, I'll show you
Love the mystery
The adventure, babe, I'll give you adventure
Run with me
And I'll show you, baby, baby, I'll show you
Love the mystery
The adventure, babe, I'll give you adventure

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I'll be your great unknown
Oh, oh, oh, oh (I'll be your great unknown)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (I'll be your great unknown)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
