I've been staring at my phone
Thought you'd show up at my door with roses
Is this really how it goes?
To fly so high and then fall down so low?

I try, I try, I try
To keep you off my mind, my mind, my mind
We do this every time
We kiss, we fight
I wanna say I'm fine
But I'm not all right

That's when I knew
That's when I knew that I loved you
That's when I knew
That's when I knew, when I knew, that I loved you

So I go out with all my friends
I dance it off to be myself again
Try to forget that you exist
But everybody knows it's all pretend
You might also like
I try, I try, I try
To keep you off my mind, my mind, my mind
We do this every time
We kiss, we fight
I wanna say I'm fine
But I'm not all right

That's when I knew
That's when I knew that I loved you
That's when I knew
That's when I knew, when I knew, that I loved you

I didn't know what I had found 'til I lost you
I didn't know that this was real 'til you disappeared
I didn't know that this was love 'til I needed you
Oh, I needed you

That's when I knew
That's when I knew that I loved you
That's when I knew
That's when I knew that I loved you
That's when I knew (Boy I love you, I really love you)
That's when I knew, when I knew that I loved you
That's when I knew
(I didn't know what I had found 'til I lost you)
That's when I knew when I loved you
(I didn't know that this was real 'til you disappeared)
I didn't know that this was love 'til I needed you
