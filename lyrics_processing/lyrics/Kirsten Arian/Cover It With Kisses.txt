Hey you
Sitting there in my room
How we ever gonna move
When we only sneaking body language?
You
Can't hide this hurt
Or dance around these words
Someday we gotta fix the damage

Right now, we've got, right now
All these feelings, we could learn something about 'em

But we cover it in kisses
No, we don't wanna talk about
How we're gonna fix this
We just wanna use our mouths to
Make up, avoid reality
Won't even feel it happen
Gonna miss it
If we keep covering it with kisses

Oh
Do you even know me?
Or how I like my coffee?
Have I even told you all my strangest dreams?
You might also likeI know
We got this chemistry
And it's our enemy
'Cause we never seem to say what we think

Right now, we've got, right now
All these feelings, we could learn something about 'em

But we cover it in kisses
No, we don't wanna talk about
How we're gonna fix this
We just wanna use our mouths to
Make up, avoid reality
Won't even feel it happen
Gonna miss it
If we keep covering it with kisses
We cover it with kisses
Covering it with kisses
We cover it with kisses
Covering it with kisses

We won't make it if we can't figure this out
I love your touch, but baby we got things to talk about
No, we won't make it if we can't speak this out loud
We cover it with, cover it with kisses
But we cover it in kisses
No, we don't wanna talk about
How we're gonna fix this
We just wanna use our mouths to
Make up, avoid reality
Won't even feel it happen
Gonna miss it
If we keep covering it with kisses
We cover it with kisses (cover it)
Covering it with kisses
We cover it with kisses (cover it)
