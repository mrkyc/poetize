I could stare into your eyes
I could stare into your heart
But you're not mine to have and give away
And I'm not the one to make you stay
To make you stay
Can you feel it when I'm near?
The subtle pounding in my chest?
And oh, I'm scared, scared you're in my thoughts
Scared I'm not the one, the one you want
The one you want

And I, I'll be different
'Cause you're different
And I, I'll be better
'Cause you're better
And I, I'll never rush the sweetness of time

I wash my hands
'Cause yours are cleaner
Cleaner than mine

And I've been watching for a while
Counting every step you take
And I just smile, my dear, do well
And I would charge with you to the gates of hell
To the gates of hell
You might also likeAnd oh, I know, I've got my past
Oh, I know, I've done some things
That made you sad
Would you love me for my faults?
'Cause you were white like snow
And I'm guilty as charged

And I, I'll be different
'Cause you're different
And I, I'll be better
'Cause you're better
And I, I'll never rush the sweetness of time

I wash my hands
'Cause yours are cleaner
Cleaner than mine
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I do not know the future
But if I did, I'd let you know
Whether or not
We were meant to love
I am okay on my own
You showed me things I did not know
And in your eyes
I see a purity I can't deny

And I, I'll be different
'Cause you're different
And I, I'll be better
'Cause you're better
And I, I'll never rush the sweetness of time

I wash my hands
'Cause yours are cleaner
