Tell me
Why, why, why
I sit you up, pushed you away-way-way
Now that you're hers, I don't want
Space, space, space
I'm gettin' jealous for ya
Passin' up fellas for ya
I guess I love ya, sorta

This isn't what I want, isn't what I thought
It just took some time to see
Now you're holding hands, makin' other plans
And they should've been with me
Feels like it's torture
Watching you fall for her
Now I want you back

She's not me
She don't got a heart, got a heart of gold like me
You don't have to sing right out your door with me
I know you don't want to start a fight, but
If we did, you'd come home with me tonight
You might also likeShe's not like, she's not like me
Ah-ah-ah, me

So won't you
Take me out
I'll piss you off, then make you
Laugh out loud
Remember why you love when
I'm around
I'm gettin' ready for ya
Wearin' my hair down for ya
I guess I love ya, sorta

This isn't what I want, isn't what I thought
It just took some time to see
Now you're holding hands, makin' other plans
And they should've been with me
This time is different
Watching you fall for her
And I don't like that

She's not me
She don't got a heart, got a heart of gold like me
You don't have to sing right out your door with me
I know you don't want to start a fight, but
If we did, you'd come home with me tonight
She's not like, she's not like me
Ah-ah-ah, me

Ooh
If you tell me that you're happy
Tell me that you're happy
I'll leave you alone
Ooh
When you're lookin' at me
When you're lookin' at me
Think that you want more

Like me
She don't got a heart, got a heart of gold like me
You don't have to sing right out your door with me
I know you don't want to start a fight, but
If we did, you'd come home with me tonight (me tonight, me tonight)
She's not like, she's not like me
