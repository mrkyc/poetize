Life's a funny mess of twists and turns of events
And it's hard to know when one begins
And the other ends
I told myself I wouldn't get broken again
But you know you're in the business of
Proving me wrong, so

Here I am with tears in my eyes
Asking myself, "Why?"

I built my house on the sand
Didn't think a tidal wave would come
And I placed my heart in your hands
Didn't think you'd leave me on the run
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

There's disappointment, then there's
Dealing with you
And it's harder than I like to admit to
I told my friends I would be careful with it
But you know I'm in the business of letting myself go
You might also like
So here I am with tears in my eyes
Asking myself, "Why?"

I built my house on the sand
Didn't think a tidal wave would come
And I placed my heart in your hands
Didn't think you'd leave me on the run
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Didn't think you'd leave me when you're done
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You wanted something shiny
So you passed right by me
You saw dollar signs
You left me behind, but
I went into hiding
Now I'm butterflying
You come crawling over
You can take a number
You wanted something shiny
So you passed right by me
You saw dollar signs
You left me behind, but
I went into hiding
Now I'm butterflying
You come crawling over
You can take a number
I won't build my house on the sand
'Cause this is not the only storm
I won't put my heart in your hands
You don't know what love is for
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You don't know what love is for
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
