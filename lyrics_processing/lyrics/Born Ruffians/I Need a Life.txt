Come help me up
And stumbling 'round
Trying to fill my cup
It's half empty
Been that way all my life
So come pour some in
And take me out tonight
The sun is shining but we stay inside
Oh but we go out at night
We stay in looking for a better life
Oh but we go out at night
We put up curtains, block out the light
Oh but we go out at night
& We stay in bed until we feel all right
Oh but we go out at night
I need meaning
I need a mission
I need a path
I need conviction
I need a life I've never had
I need much more good & much less bad
The sun is shining but we stay inside
Oh but we go out at night
We stay in looking for a better life
Oh but we go out at night
We put up curtains, block out the light
Oh but we go out at night
& We stay in bed until we feel all right
Oh but we go out at night
You might also likeI found meaning
I found a mission
I found a lord
I found religion
I found something I never had
I'm not sure what but it's not half bad
& I'm glad
I'm so, so glad
Those party habits are gone & dead
I'm turning in my old sinful ways
For a dull new life so I can pray, pray, pray
The sun is shining but we stay inside
Oh but we go out at night
We stay in looking for a better life
Oh but we go out at night
We put up curtains, block out the light
Oh but we go out at night
& We stay in bed until we feel all right
Oh but we go out at night
I need a life
I've never had
I need so much more good, lord
