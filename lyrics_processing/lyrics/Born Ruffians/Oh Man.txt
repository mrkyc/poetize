Oh man, oh man
Go away man
I want to sit right here and sip down the rest of my beer
I got a funny feeling
I think she might be cheating and he knows
Oh, he's gonna let it show
She got the funny feeling
She put it on the ceiling
And she's old and I told her
Oh man, you're getting old man
You're letting go old man
Why won't you understand?
You're on a roll man
Oh man, keep those knees up when you run
Don't look behind or ahead
You're blind until you're dead
I got a funny feeling
I got a funny feeling
Like the geeky kid in the ladies shoes
Who's he think he's fooling?
Another year of ruling your own
And your on your own man
What do you own, man?
What's reaped and sewn, oh man
Been down that road again
Don't stop for no man
Oh man, I got to go man
And I take my place in this wonderful race
You might also likeOh I'm not a lonely soul
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I just got to let it roll
The way you roll determines all your wishes and your wants

Oh man, you're getting old man
You're letting go old man
Why won't you understand?
You're letting go man
Oh man, you gotta go
And go take your place in this wonderful race
Oh I'm not a lonely soul
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I just got to let it roll
The way you roll determines all your wishes and your wants
Oh I'm not a lonely soul
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Just got to let it roll
