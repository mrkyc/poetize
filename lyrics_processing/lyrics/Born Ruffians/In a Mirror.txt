You sure look pretty
I wish I had a song for you
So they were wasted in 002

In a mirror I can see her walking sideways
Walking my way
Keeping time on her thigh
Think she's mine but I'm still high

And we're both thinking how we're not here
A gracious host, we feel like ghosts
We think too much and disappear
Don't think like most
Can feel her close
And if you weren't real I'd make you up
And we'd do everything together
I'd make you meals and call you up
We'd never talk about the weather

In a mirror I can see her walking sideways
Walking my way
Keeping time on her thigh
Think she's mine but I'm still high
You might also likeIn a mirror I can see her walking sideways
Walking my way
Keeping time on her thigh
Think she's mine but I'm still high

If you weren't here
I'd write you down
And read you out into a crowd
I'd tell them all how you we're mine
They'd see how I was proud
We'd rub our cheeks
In hopes that maybe
Some good looks would rub off on me
And nose to nose as I'd make you feel close
So I'd never feel lonely at sea

In a mirror I can see her walking sideways
Walking my way
Keeping time on her thigh, think she's mine
But I'm still high
In a mirror I can see her walking sideways
Walking my way
Keeping time on her thigh, think she's mine
But I'm still high
Some people say that it's love
Don't know what they're talking about
Don't understand what is love
I'll let them figure it out
It's just a chemical reaction
When signals fire through your brain
But I sure think that it's fun
Think that it makes me feel safe
Eyes see the juice on your lips
Eyes send that straight to my brain
Brain makes hand squeeze on your tits
