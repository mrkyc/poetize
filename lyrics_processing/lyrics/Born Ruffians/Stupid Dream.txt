I know this girl
She never seems to let the world
Get underneath her perfect skin
I asked her once
Just how she did it

She said
When I can I clear my head
And when I can not
I mess it up instead
It's just a useless stupid dream

Oh no!
I'm a formidable being!
But do I really have meaning
No, no, no
Or understanding of what I call myself
Or did I forget a past life?
And figure out it's just a useless
Stupid dream
I am not the cream of the crop
Oh no, destroy it
You might also like
I forget, did I misplace my head
I must remember what she said
About the way one can transcend
Beyond the living dead

She said
When I can I clear my head
When I can not
I mess it up instead
It's just a useless, stupid dream

Oh no!
I'm a formidable being!
But do I really have meaning
Or understanding
Of what I call myself
Or did I forget a past life?
And figure out it's just a useless
Stupid dream
I am not the cream of the crop
And I am never rising up
Oh no!
Destroy it
Destroy it
When I can I clear my head &
When I can not, I mess it up instead
When I can I clear my head &
When I can not, I mess it up instead

I'm a formidable being!
But do I really have meaning
Or understanding
Of what I call myself
Or did I forget a past life?
And figure out it's just a useless
Stupid dream
I am not the cream of the crop
And I am never rising up
And I am never gonna stop
If I get knocked down
Better get back up
And if they say no
Well then I'll say yup
Oh no
