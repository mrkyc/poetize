I write to you to tell you true
Not that I used to be just like you
Because I'm still confused and ill
Relief relief
I wish I was a boy
Cause all I do
Yes all I do
Is try so hard to get better
But see, people like a freak show
They don't want to see a kid grow
Go from fucked up to normal

So what does it provokes the voice that I misspoke
When family heirloom broke on the doorway
It should've been my hand
I'm not a good man
I try so hard
I try so hard to be one
And so, I look out to you
But fuck I hate you too
You gave me everything I ever wanted
And see I like to watch things burn
And see what might return
A phoenix
Arises from the ashes

Not everything can be light and bright and filled with color
See somethings that are just black and white and dead or duller
Open up your windows and feel outside
The rain is falling steadily through the night
Drops and constellations as one oooh
Take of all your clothes and run oooh
Until you are good and gone and turning into nothing
Its like a rising sun oooh
Gotta look away and back again oooh
To understand the changes that we are going through oooh
