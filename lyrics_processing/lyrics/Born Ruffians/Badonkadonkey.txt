I, I got you in my pocket
For when I get home
Keep you in my pocket
For when I get home
I keep you in my pocket
For when I get home
When I get home, when I get home

Will you be sticking with me
When the money's gone?
Will you be sticking with me
When the money's gone?
Will you be sticking with me
When the money's gone?
The money's gone, the money's gone

And I don't give a damn about
When I see you, I don't
And I don't give a damn about
What I owe you, I don't, I don't, I don't
The disappearing kindness
That I show for you, I know
The loving that you gave to me
Was wasted too
You might also like
I'm picking up your presents
When your birthday comes
I'm picking up your presents
When your birthday comes
I'm picking up your presents
When your birthday comes
Your birthday comes, your birthday comes

I'm cooking up a dinner now
For 6 p.m
I'm cooking up your dinner now
For 6 p.m
I'm cooking up a dinner now
For 6 p.m
For 6 p.m, for 6 p.m

And I don't give a damn about
When I see you, I don't
And I don't give a damn about
What I owe you, I don't, I don't, I don't
The disappearing kindness
That I show for you, I know
The loving that you gave to me
Was wasted too
I'm taking you to put you
Underneath my thumb
I'm taking you to put you
Underneath my thumb
I'm placing you down neatly
Underneath my thumb
Beneath my thumb, beneath my thumb

And If you get squished
I'll find another you
And If you get squashed
I'll just find another you
It won't be hard to find another one like you
Another you, another you

And I don't give a damn about
When I see you, I don't
And I don't give a damn about
The I-owe-yous, I don't, I don't, I don't
The disappearing kindness
That I show for you, I know
I won't be sad
