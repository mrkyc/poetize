Just to let me know that I can fall apart
No one wants to hear the birds sing morning's near
Day will soon become night again my dear
I don't want to know the pain of a broken heart
I always know to stop before it starts
No one wants to hear the boy sing love sick songs
Just keep dancing, keep smiling even if it feels wrong
It's not the place, nor the time
Nor that I can't keep you mine
Your smile, my smile
Our faces mash a while
It's not the place, nor the time
Nor that I can't keep you mine
Your smile, my smile
Our faces mash a while
"Tiger got to hunt bird got to fly
Man got to sit and wonder why, why, why
Tiger got to sleep bird got to land
Man got to tell himself he understand"
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
