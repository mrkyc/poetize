When am I supposed to say so long?
When I fall in love 'fore dusk is dawn
When you take my hand across the lawn
With the eyes so sweet they're like a fawn
Red elephant is wet and long
How am I supposed to wash you off?
Rungs of bad poems I've hacked and coughed
But I have to spare a breath for you
Which I'll take, before we make anew
Our hearts will take a stroll for two
Our feet will take the avenue
And walk in unison, so cute
Red elephant is turning blue
Why am I here when you're over there?
Let's meet at the fountains in Dundas Square
And who am I supposed to be with you?
I'll wait 'til you say and pretend I knew
Because if it's true that walls can talk
How mine would brag of tears I've sobbed
When thinking of the way we walked
Along the paths of sideway chalk
Forever under ticking clock
Where you and I are free to flock
You might also likeWhat can I write when I know it's wrong?
Slapping my knee to my own damn song
And where can we go when the sinking stops?
To the pit of my chest as it drops and drops...
Put your head upon my chest, it breathes
And my fingers through your hair they weave
And your shoulders are the perfect sea
In which I get lost invariably
Oh the elephant is up to sea
If it meets the peach fish underneath
And when I am you and you are me
We are stirred as spoons in lover's tea
Put your head upon my chest, it breathes
And my fingers through your hair they weave
And your shoulders are the perfect sea
In which I get lost invariably
Oh the elephant is up to sea
If it meets the peach fish underneath
And when I am you and you are me
We are stirred as spoons in lover's tea
Put your head upon my chest, it breathes
And my fingers through your hair they weave
And your shoulders are the perfect sea
In which I get lost invariably
Oh the elephant is up to sea
If it meets the peach fish underneath
And when I am you and you are me
We are stirred as spoons in lover's tea
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
