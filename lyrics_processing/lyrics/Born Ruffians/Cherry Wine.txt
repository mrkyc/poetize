Well, it's funny to abuse me
Little things you do amuse me
And they will until I'm dead
I'm neat but not a doozy
You're cheap but not a floozy
And are always good in bed

And our money's disappearing
With the songs I'm always hearing
Floating round inside my head
I find the lids are always leering
Unopened and a-rearing
Placing new ones here instead

Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Cherry Wine

'Til close my eyes to die
Bring me peace of mind, my cherry wine
Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Cherry Wine
Ch-Ch-Cherry Wine
'Til I die I'll be so fine
Swimming in my peace of mind on my cherry wine
You might also like
Well, it's funny how they use me
They could easily abuse me
Cause I go where I am led
And one more drink and then they lose me
When I think I'm in the movies
And I wish that I was dead

Life is long if you spend it alone
This one cuts to the bone
Being lonely
Being alone
Nights long lost into unknowns
Bad poems written for fun
I know I'm the loneliest one
