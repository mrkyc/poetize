Thinking of your shadow
Sail away, oh, sail away, go
Silhouette, oh, silhouette, oh
Thinking of her shadow
Sail away, oh, sail away, go
She like to keep the sun behind her
Spring days running wild
Keep her head down as she's walking
Silhouette, see her wet hair flying
Cause she always liked her shadow
More than her reflection
It's a better understanding
Silhouette, silhouette
Thinking of her shadow makes me sweat
Cause she always liked her shadow
More than her reflection
It's a better understanding
Of her place in the world
She's leaving our world behind
For the one that's in her mind, with her shadow
She like to keep the sun behind her
Spring days running wild
Keep her head down as she's walking
Silhouette, see her wet hair flying
Cause she always liked her shadow
More than her reflection
It's a better understanding

That were taught, but she fought even as a child
See, most people don't know what it's like
But, but she sure does
Spring days she's running wild
Keep her head down, silhouette, wet hair flying
See, real people don't belong inside
And she needs the sun
Cause she always liked her shadow
More than her reflection
It's a better understanding
Of her place in the world
She's leaving our world behind
For the one that's in her mind, with her shadow
Silhouette, or sail away, oh
Thinking of her shadow
Silhouette, or sail away, go
She's written off all the lies
That were taught, but she fought even as a child
See, real people don't belong inside
And she needs the sun
Cause she always liked her shadow

It's a better understanding
Of her place in the world
She always liked her shadow
