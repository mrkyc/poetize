Feet up on the cooler
Them tunes pouring out of that sliding rear window
Laugh to the beat of that tape deck radio
Mmm it's a heaven on earth moment
Got a good thing going
Round and round like the wheels of this night
It's a singing along kiss, close your eyes
I don't like this living, I love it
Sweet magnolia blue skies up above it
I don't call Carolina just a place I visit
I call Carolina home
I don't like drinking beer, I love it
On the back porch swinging with my honey
Life's too short just to like it so you better get to loving
This living before it's gone
Life's too short
Better get to living if the beer's ice cold
You better get to sipping if the song's in the air
Get you out a lighter if the party's rocking
You pull an all-nighter cause life's too short
Mmm that six string's strumming, ain't it?
This scene's all God painted
I'm soaking you in while you're soaking it in
It's like a movie baby, ain't it? Oh don't waste it

You pull an all-nighter cause life's too short
Oh
You better get to pouring
Oh
Cause life's too short now
I don't like this living, I love it
Sweet magnolia blue skies up above it
I don't call Carolina just a place I visit
I call Carolina home
I don't like drinking beer, I love it
On the back porch swinging with my honey

This living before it's gone
Life's too short
Yeah you better get to living (The beer's ice cold)
Oh you gotta get to sipping (The song's in the air)
I'm gonna get you out a lighter (The party's rocking)
