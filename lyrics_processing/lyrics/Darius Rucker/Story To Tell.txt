Six kids in a two room shack
Soon as I learned those three chords
I had a guitar on my back
I wanted to carry a football
That dream came and went real soon
Made it through two years of college
Thank God I could carry a tune
Nah nah, yeah-eh, thank God, I could carry a tune
I've known love, I've known pain
Got a little rusty in the rain
I've been lost, I've been found
I left my mark on my little bitty town
Yeah, raised me a few good babies
Raised me a whole lotta hell
And if I ever get to heaven
I'm gonna have a story to tell, yeah
If I get there, I'm gonna have a story to tell
I drank a lot of cheap whiskey
Shut down too many bars
Low as a dog in the valley
And high as the Carolina stars
I've kissed some girls, still missed some girls
Most beautiful you've ever seen
I gave my heart to a woman
Who didn't give a damn about me

Got a little rusty in the rain
I've been lost, I've been found
I left my mark on my little bitty town
Yeah, raised me a few good babies
Raised me a whole lotta hell
And if I ever get to heaven
I'm gonna have a story to tell, yeah
If I get there, I'm gonna have a story to tell
It's got some parts that'll make you laugh
And some that'll make you cry
Some pages I wish I could tear out
Well I ain't gonna tell no lie
'Cause it's a story of my life
No I can't preach or give no advice
I didn't do everything well
But man, just live while you're alive
And try to have a story to tell
I've known love, I've known pain
Got a little rusty in the rain
Yeah I've been lost, I've been found
I left my mark on my little bitty town
I raised me a few good babies
I raised me a whole lotta hell
And if I ever get to heaven
I'm gonna have a story to tell, yeah
If I get there, I'll have a real good story to tell
