I grew up just west of the tracks
Holding me to hold me back
Around your door
She's calling out my name
She she said son, won't you go outside, I got a man coming over tonight
The seventh one in seven days
So I go down to the parking lot
And hang around all my friends
And roam the streets 'til dawn
Breaks again
I come in at 5 AM
And she is waiting for me
She said, "Where have you been?", I said, "I was out!"
She said, "You're no good cause you're running without love"

And I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell (to hell, woohoo)
I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell
Oh and I'm gonna burn it down, baby
See Darius Rucker LiveGet tickets as low as $149You might also like
The black widow and the ladies man
Met down at the laundromat
And tried to make me understand
The neighbors were all in a stir
About what they might have heard
And runnin' down they shouted out
So it seemed
Next door, a girl she lived
About the same age as me
And asked me to come upstairs
For a see
And just then, her mother bursts in
And said, "You're the son of that bitch in the wind
Get out of my house and hit the road"
And I kept falling like a Rolling Stones' song

'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell (oh straight to hell)
I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell

Aww shuck boys
The stars came out
And warned me so
As I walked on down the road
Fifty bucks and a suitcase steered me clear
She took my hand as we walked into the sun
A new day's promise had just begun
We'll make it alone whether you like it or not
And I turned around and shouted "Help me momma!"

'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell
Alright boys sing it one more time
Oh yeah, I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell

(Oh Lord help us
Yeah I'll bring the whiskey boys
Y'all taking me with ya
Help me Jesus, help me Jesus, we all are
