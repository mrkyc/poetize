We don't get too many nights
All alone, peace and quiet
Call it busy, call it a life
And I don't tell you near enough
Just how much I'm missing us
And making that temperature rise
But girl, I'm gonna show you tonight

So, let's drink what's left of this bottle of wine
Move a little closer 'til the sparks start flyin'
Turn the lights down low and pull the Conway off of the shelf
Then we'll dance through the kitchen and straight down the hall
Let my old blue jeans and your sundress fall
Girl, we're holding the lighter
And fires don't start themselves

Well, I wanna take my time
Love you slow, love you right
Shadows dancing on the wall
Your lips, your hips, your fingertips
Every inch of you just fits
Like the shirt that I got on
Gonna love you, baby, all night long

Let my old blue jeans and your sundress fall
Girl, we're holding the lighter
And fires don't start themselves
No, fires don't start themselves

No, there ain't no putting it out
Might just burn this whole place down
Starting right now

So, let's drink what's left of this bottle of wine
Move a little closer 'til the sparks start flyin'
Turn the lights down low and pull the Conway off of the shelf (Oh yeah)
Then we'll dance through the kitchen and straight down the hall
Let my old blue jeans and your sundress fall
Girl, we're holding the lighter
And fires don't start themselves, no, no
Fires don't start themselves
