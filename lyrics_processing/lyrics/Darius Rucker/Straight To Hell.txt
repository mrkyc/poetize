I grew up just west of the tracks
Holding me to hold me back
Around your door she's calling out my name
I come in at 5 AM
And she is waiting for me
She said, "Where have you been?", I said, "I was out!"
She said, "You're no good cause you're running without love"

And I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell (to hell, woohoo)
I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell
Oh and I'm gonna burn it down, baby

The black widow and the ladies man
Met down at the laundromat
And tried to make me understand
And just then, her mother bursts in
And said, "You're the son of that bitch in the wind
Get out of my house and hit the road"
And I kept falling like a Rolling Stones' song
See Darius Rucker LiveGet tickets as low as $149You might also like
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell (oh straight to hell)
I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell

The stars came out and warned me so
As I walked on down the road
Fifty bucks and a suitcase steered me clear
She took my hand as we walked into the sun
A new day's promise had just begun
We'll make it alone whether you like it or not
And I turned around and shouted "Help me momma!"

'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell
Oh yeah, I'm going straight to hell
Ooh just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell

(Oh Lord help us
Yeah I'll bring the whiskey boys
Y'all taking me with ya
Help me Jesus, help me Jesus, we all are
