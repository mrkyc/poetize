He didn't have to wake up
He'd been up all night
Lying there in bed listening
To his new born baby cry
He makes a pot of coffee
He splashes water on his face
His wife gives him a kiss and says
It is going to be OK

It won't be like this for long
One day we'll look back laughing
At the week we brought her home
This phase is going to fly by
So baby just hold on
It won't be like this for long

Four years later bout four thirty
She's crawling in their bed
And when he drops her off at preschool
She's clinging to his leg
The teacher peels her off of him
He says what can I do
She says now do not you worry
This will only last a week or two

It won't be like this for long
One day soon you'll drop her off
And she won't even know you're gone
This phase is going to fly by
If you could just hold on
It won't be like this for long

Someday soon she'll be a teenager
And at times he'll think she hates him
Then he'll walk her down the aisle
And he'll raise her veil
But right now she up and crying
And the truth is that he don't mind
As he kisses her good night
And she says her prayers
He lays down there beside her
Till her eyes are finally closed
And just watching her it breaks his heart
Cause he already knows

It won't be like this for long
One day soon that little girl is going to be
All grown up and gone
Yeah this phase is going to fly by
He is trying to hold on
It won't be like this for long
