Bring that smile when you bite your lip
Bring that two-glass tipsy kiss
That stayed just a little too long
Baby, bring on your little short fuse
Your "can you carry my high heel shoes?"
Your little small town attitude
Makes me feel right at home
Bring it on, bring it on
Bring the fire, bring the storm
All your love like a flood
Raining down on me
Bring that laugh, bring those stars
Bring your jagged little heart
All those pieces of you
I ain't scared to love you
Baby bring it on
Baby bring it on
Come on with your heart on your sleeve
That makeup that you don't need
That angel that you don't see
When you look in the mirror
Bring your future, bring your past
Bring your "scared to fall too fast"
All those perfect imperfections
Bring that girl I gotta have
