I was up in New York City just the other week
You should've seen the waitress's face when I ordered sweet tea
She said we don't have that here and I apologized
I said please forgive me I'm in a southern state of mind

And those girls out in California they don't understand
They don't like it when I hold the door or when I say yes ma'am
They act like I done something wrong and they give me the evil eye
I say honey I'm sorry I'm in a southern state of mind

I could be anywhere
In my heart I'm always there
Where they drink sweet tea and they raise you to be polite
No changing' who I am
That's the way I've always been
No matter what state I'm in
I'm in a southern state of mind

I'm always walking' round telling' everybody hi
Just a wavin' at the strangers in the cars passing' by
Some people may look at me and say "that boy just ain't right"
Hey y'all I ain't crazy I'm in a southern state of mind

I could be anywhere
In my heart I'm always there
Where you know every body and if you don't then your still polite
No changin' who I am, that's they way I've always been
No matter what state I'm in
I'm in a southern state of mind

You can see it in the clothes I wear, you can hear it when I talk
Ball cap, boots and jeans and a little southern drawl
I could be up in Ohio or back home in Caroline
No matter what state I'm in
I'm in a southern state of mind
Don't matter what state I'm in
I'm in a southern state of mind
