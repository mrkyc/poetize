All my ghosts are out on the porch
Smoking reefer and holding court
I go outside and tell them to go away
They let themselves in and say "Hey, lady"
And now they're calling up all their friends

All my ghosts are in my living room
Trippin' on LSD and sniffing glue
I was gonna take a bath maybe drink some tea
This is the last thing in hell I need
Am I stuck with them? Are they stuck with me?

They're under my bed, they're in my sheets
They're too fucked up to frighten me
I ain't scared of my ghosts
I ain't scared of my ghosts
I could cut them off, I could make them leave
But I kinda like their company
I ain't scared of my ghosts
The thing that scares me the most is me

All my ghosts are on Adderall
Ripping sinks from my bathroom wall
They ain't got no appetite
Still they're up in my kitchen drinking my high life, oh
I know they'll keep on going 'til they suck me dry

They're under my bed and in my sheets
Too fucked up to frighten me
Oh, I ain't scared of my ghosts
I ain't scared of my ghosts
I could cut 'em off and make them leave
But I kinda like their company
Oh, I ain't scared of my ghosts
The thing that scares me the most is me

All my ghosts are enablers
They brought all my angels right down here to Earth
Now there's nobody left to rescue me
'Cause my poor angels are in recovery, yeah, the
Ghosts are gone and they took the weed and they
Left another big mess for me, oh, all, all my ghosts

All my ghosts
All my ghosts
