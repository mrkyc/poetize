I used to drive to Montreal
Look up at the departure wall
And buy me a ticket to anywhere I never been
I'd look at my planet from above
Meet the pilot, maybe make love
Touch down and let that city sweep me off my feet

Take me back to the good times
When I drank up life like I drink my wine
Why's there always gotta be a window in between me
And everything and everyone I wanna see?

'Cause we can't go out but we still wanna dance
We can't go out but we still want a chance for love
Oh-oh-oh-oh
No, we can't go out but I still wanna sing
Can't go out but I still wanna bring back love
Oh-oh-oh-oh
There's got to be a way that we can turn this ship around, ah
'Cause you can't keep a good time down

Can't keep
Can't keep a good time
Can't keep
Can't keep a good time
Can't keep
Can't keep a good time down

In my dance-hall dreams
I'm a benevolent queen
Riding on a white horse across a dance floor
I've got flowers in my hair
And there's sugar in the air
I wanna live my whole life like it's the last night at Studio54, oh-oh-oh

Baby, take me back to the good times
When I drank up life like I drink my wine
Why's there gotta be a window in between me
And everything and everyone I wanna see?

'Cause we can't go out but I still wanna dance
Can't go out but I still need a chance for love
Oh-oh-oh-oh
No, we can't go out but I still wanna sing
I can't go out but I still wanna bring back love
