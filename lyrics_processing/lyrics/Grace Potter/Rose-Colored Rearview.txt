Hey there, pretty girl
You've got everybody's eyes
It's five dollars at the door
But you ain't gotta pay tonight
'Cause the moon is shining golden
Like a fallen angel holding your spotlight
I feel it flooding back into me
Watch my memories like a movie

In my rose-colored rearview
Where everything is brand new
And everything is gonna be alright (Everything gonna be alright)
I may be the one to blame
Still I'm pouring pink champagne on the fire
When the truth don't set me free
Well, I like the lies I see
In my rose-colored rearview
(Rose-colored rearview)

So hold the ghosts at bay
I can't talk to you tonight
Go do what you do best
Run away and hide
And if you don't go then I will
'Cause I know how to take the keys and drive
I'm climbing out of my own shadow
Blowing smoke and looking into

My rose-colored rearview
Where everything is brand new
Everything is gonna be alright (Everything gonna be alright)
I may be the one to blame
Still I'm pouring pink champagne on the fire
When the truth don't set me free
I kinda like the lies I see
In my rose-colored rearview
Rose, rose, rose, rose (Yeah, hey)

Mirror, mirror on the wall
You're the clearest of 'em all and I can't take it, no
One day I'll run out of gas
I know I can't outrun my past but I can fake it
Tonight the truth is what I make it in my

Rose-colored rearview
Where everything is brand new
Everything is gonna be just fine (Everything gonna be just fine)
I may be the one to blame
Still I'm pouring pink champagne on the fire
Singing la-dee-da,  c'est-la-vie
It's all the same to me
In my rose-colored rearview
(Yeah) Rose-colored rearview
