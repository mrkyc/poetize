They told you to keep your head down
They told you not to run
They told you "we're sorry, you're not the fortunate one"
They told me to keep it quiet
Said my day would never come
So I screamed my lungs out and I ran straight for the sun

And they always told us we would be nothing
Look what we've done (look what we've done), hey
And they always told us we would be nothing
But look what we've become (look what we've become)

And they told you you don't understand
They told you, "let it go"
And then they took you by the hand
And led you out the door
Your words don't make a sound
My dreams are on the floor
But you're rising up from underground
And I'm nothing like I was before

And they always told us we would be nothing
But look what we've done (look what we've done), hey
And they always told us we would be nothing
Now look what we've become (look what we've become)

They say it's over now
The world is over you
They told me "no regrets"
There's nothing you can do
But I won't fade to black
On the walk that will be damned
I'll wear my heart like a flag and run
Straight for the sun

Always told us we would be nothing
And they always told us we would be nothing

Told us "keep your heads down"
They told us not to run
They told us "we're sorry, you're not the chosen ones"
They told us to keep it quiet
And said our day would never come
So we screamed our bloody lungs out and ran straight for the sun

And they always told us we would be nothing
And look what we've done (look what we've done), hey
And they always told us we would be nothing
But look what we've become (look what we've become)
Uh, uh
