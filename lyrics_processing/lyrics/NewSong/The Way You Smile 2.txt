The way that you laugh at the silliest things
I love the way that you love so unselfishly
You bring out the best in everything
There's a million more, these are just a few
Of the many reasons I love you
But there's something about the way you smile
I can see forever in your eyes
Telling me I'm yours and you're all mine
The way that you smile
We're like two lovers in sweet romance
You're my leading lady and I'm your man
You can say I love you with just a glance
The way you smile
The way you smile
The way you smile
The way you open the door you always see about me
Treat me like I'm a princess boy you're so sweet
Love the way that I feel when I'm in your arms
You whisper "You're beautiful" so safe and warm
There's a million more, these are just a few
Of the many reasons I love you
But there's something about the way you smile
I can see forever in your eyes
Telling me I'm yours and you're all mine
The way that you smile
We're like two lovers in a sweet romance
I'm your leading lady and you're man
You can say I love you with just a glance
The way you smile
The way you smile
The way you smile
