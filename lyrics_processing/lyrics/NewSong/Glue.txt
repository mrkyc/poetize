I asked the stars, "Who's holding you in space?"
"Are they the Hands that hung the moon in place?"
"Who tells the sun to wake up, when it's time to rise?"
"And still watched over me, when I sleep at night?"

And there's only one answer
You are the glue that holds us together
You are the glue that holds us together ...

I keep looking up and you keep walking beside me
When I lose my way You're there to guide me
I can fall apart but Your arm's around me
You are the glue that holds us together

Whose are the Hands who took the nails with love
And opened Heaven's doors up wide for us?
Who is the One that speaks a Word and calms our hearts?
When everything around tries to fall apart

And there's only one answer
You are the glue that holds us together
You are the glue that holds us together ...
You might also like
I keep looking up and you keep walking beside me
When I lose my way You're there to guide me
I can fall apart but Your arm's around me
You are the glue that holds us together

I keep looking up and You keep walking beside me
When I lose my way You're there to guide me
I can fall apart but Your arm's around me
You are the glue that holds us together
I keep looking up and You keep walking beside me
When I lose my way You're there to guide me
I can fall apart but Your arm's around me
You are the glue that holds us together
I keep looking up and You keep walking beside me
When I lose my way You're there to guide me
I can fall apart but Your arm's around me
You are the glue that holds us together ....
