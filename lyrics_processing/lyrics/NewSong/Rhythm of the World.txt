An everyday reminder
Of the times we're going through
Brother fighting brother
Faces filled with hate
From Africa to Bosnia
From New York to L.A
The rhythm of the hands of time
Are beating out a sound
Like an orchestra in motion
Creation's calling out
That's the rhythm of the world
Moving us closer
To the day of His return
That's the rhythm of the world
And it gets stronger
Every time this big ball turns
Every day we're closer than before
That's the rhythm of the world
Our lives are spinning faster
Than we ever thought they could
And we see more hurting people
Than we ever dreamed we would
Oh, but don't let your heart be troubled
All this sorrow must take place
They're warning signs from heaven
Telling us He's on His way
