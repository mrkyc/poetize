I have a passion in my heart
I've never known before
That makes me love Him more
To die is gain
I am learning through surrender
What it really means
To know that I am free
And it's my prayer
I would live each day in such a way
That in all I do I would bring Him praise
For the glory of Christ
I'll lay down everything that I've been given
All my hopes and my ambitions
For what He wants for me
For the glory of Christ
(All for His glory)
I'll take up my cross and follow
Wherever He may lead, I'll live my life
For the glory of Christ
He knows my heart
He knows I seldom measure up
To what I long to be
And what He has for me
I know His grace
And I have seen how far His arms
Will reach to rescue me
From the man that I could be

I would live each day in such a way

I'll lay down everything that I've been given
All my hopes and my ambitions
For what He wants for me
For the glory of Christ
(All for His glory)
I'll take up my cross and follow
Wherever He may lead, I'll live my life
For the glory of Christ
And when I think of what my life was worth
And how He gave His life
To bring salvation to this world
How could I ever offer less than He deserves
For the glory of Christ
(For the glory)
I'll lay down everything that I've been given
All my hopes and my ambitions
For what He wants for me
For the glory of Christ
(For the glory)
I'll take up my cross and follow
Wherever He may lead, I'll live my life
Wherever He may lead, I'll live my life
For the glory of Christ
For the glory of Jesus
For the glory of Christ
For the glory of Christ
For the glory, ooh...
For the glory, ooh...
