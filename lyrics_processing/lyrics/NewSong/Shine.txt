Here's a simple song
Make you wanna sing along
The truth goes on and on
And it's up to us to shout it
God came down to us
To show how to love
Put His light in us
To tell everyone about it

So everybody sing
Give your everything
Lift your hands and don't hold back
Let the whole world see it

We gotta
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Let your light shine, shine
For the world to see
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Let your light shine, shine
For the world to see

Every day, every day, every day, every day, every day
Every day, every day, every day, every day, every day

It's a feeling that you get
You can't get over it
God's not vanished yet
So don't you ever doubt it
Just keep shining bright
Keep holding back the night
We're here to be alive
And we need to  about it

So everybody sing
Give your everything
Lift your hands and don't hold back
Let the whole world see it

We gotta
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Let your light shine, shine
For the world to see
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Let your light shine, shine
For the world to see
The light that shines the brightest shines the farthest
You better believe it, nothing can stop it
The light that shines the brightest shines the farthest
You better believe it, nothing can stop it (like stars in the heaven)
Every day, every day, every day, every day, every day
Every day, every day, every day, every day, every day

You gotta
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Let your light shine, shine
For the world to see
