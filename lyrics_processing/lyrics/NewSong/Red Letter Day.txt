Another red letter day
(It's gonna be another red letter day)
Every day before the rush gets started
I get down on my knees
And I pray, Lord, I need You here to guide me
Please speak to me
And something happens that I can't explain
His Word starts talking to me
And I'm out to face this world again
I do believe it's gonna be
Another red letter day
(It's gonna be another red letter day)
I do believe it's gonna be
Another chance for me
To take His Word and walk by faith
I got a smile with every step I take
Knowing He is here with me
It's gonna be a red letter day
I had a friend call me up and tell me
How he struggles through each day
I told him that I didn't have all of the answers
This world's a crazy place
But I've learned to hide God's word in my heart
So, I can have it with me
When the pressures of the day start

I got a smile with every step I take
Knowing He is here with me
It's gonna be a red letter day
(I do believe)
So many hidden treasures
In God's Word for us to find
(So many treasures)
The mysteries and secrets
That are there to bring us life
I do believe it's gonna be
Another red letter day
(It's gonna be another red letter day)
I do believe it's gonna be
Another chance for me
To take His Word and walk by faith
