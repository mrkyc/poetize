Trouble, trouble, so much at stake
Making me wonder, is making me shake
I will not worry, I know that You're here
I fix my eyes on You, my troubles disappear

Whatever it is I think
I will not be afraid, no

Down, down
You will never let me down, down
Even when I hit the ground, down
I know that Your love is holding me and You're all I need
Down, down
You will never let me down, down
Even when I hit the ground, down
I know that Your love's surrounding me and You're all I need

Faithful, faithful, You're faithful and strong
You walk beside, You're leading me on
My strength is failing, You know I am weak
That's when You pick me up and You whisper words of peace
You might also like
Whatever it is I think
I will not be afraid, no, no, no

Down, down
You will never let me down, down
Even when I hit the ground, down
I know that Your love is holding me and You're all I need
Down, down
You will never let me down, down
Even when I hit the ground, down
I know that Your love's surrounding me and You're all I need

You lift me up, You help me stand
When my strength is gone You hold my hand
Let the wind blow, let the earth shake
When I'm with You I'm not afraid
When I'm with You I'm not afraid
Hmmh, I'm not afraid
You're all I need!

Down, down
You will never let me down, down
Even when I hit the ground, down
I know that Your love is holding me and You're all I need
Down, down
You will never let me down, down
Even when I hit the ground, down
I know that Your love's surrounding me and You're all I need
Down, down
You will never let me down, down
Even when I hit the ground, down
I know that Your love is holding me and You're all I need
You're all I need!
Down, down
You will never let me down, down
Even when I hit the ground, down
I know that Your love's surrounding me and You're all I need
