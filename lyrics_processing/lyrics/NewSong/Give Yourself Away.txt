And you don't know what to say
The best thing you can do for them
Is to give yourself away
Lend a hand to lift the broken
Let your heart break when God's heart breaks
Speak up for those who have no voice
And give yourself away
Give yourself away
Be the hands and feet of Jesus
Give yourself away
Go out and make a world of difference
Let this be the day
You see how far that His love reaches
The greatest sacrifice of all
Is to give yourself away
Yes, it is
Jesus saw us in our suffering
He saw the debt that sin had made
And on that cruel and fateful cross
He gave Himself away
Jesus knew what love would cost Him
A price that only He could pay
And though they ridiculed and spat on Him
He gave Himself away
You might also likeGive yourself away
Be the hands and feet of Jesus
Give yourself away
Go out and make a world of difference
Let this be the day
You see how far that His love reaches
The greatest sacrifice of all
Is to give yourself away
The greatest sacrifice of all
Is to give yourself away
So, don't hold back, don't hold on
For someone else to come along
The time is now, it's up to us
To go out and prove His love
There's a hurting world that's dying
For someone to come and love them
The only way to truly live
Is to give yourself away
Oh, give yourself away
Be the hands and feet of Jesus
Give yourself away
Go out and make a world of difference
Let this be the day
You see how far that His love reaches
The greatest sacrifice of all
Is to give yourself away
Give yourself away
Be the hands and feet of Jesus
Give yourself away
Go out and make a world of difference
Let this be the day
You see how far that His love reaches
The greatest sacrifice of all
Is to give yourself away
The greatest sacrifice of all
Is to give yourself away
Give yourself away, give yourself away
Go out and make a world of difference
