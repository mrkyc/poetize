Saw a penny on the sidewalk this morning and I thought about You
I kept it to remind me that You care about the little things too
Saw a shooting star falling from the heavens and I thought about You
As I stood there in the wonder of the night; I thought about You

I thought about You thinking about me
And how You promise to take care of all my needs
So even when I'm walking through the very darkest night
I won't worry about tomorrow
I know my future's bright

A million miles before me and a million behind
I've been walking down this road called, "Faith" for such a long time
Everywhere I look I see evidence of You
And when I didn't think that I could go on, I thought about You

I thought about You thinking about me
And how You promise to take care of all my needs
So even when I'm walking through the very darkest night
I won't worry about tomorrow
I know my future's bright
You might also like
I can feel Your grace shining on my face
Reaching deep inside of me and filling me with faith
And I can hear Your voice breaking through the noise
Giving me the hope I need, reminding me I'm Yours
I can feel Your grace shining on my face
Reaching deep inside of me and filling me with faith
And I can hear Your voice breaking through the noise
Giving me the hope I need, reminding me I'm Yours

I thought about You thinking about me
And how You promise to take care of all my needs
So even when I'm walking through the very darkest night
I won't worry about tomorrow
I know my future's bright
I know my future's bright

Saw a penny on the sidewalk this morning and I thought about You
