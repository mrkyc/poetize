That your life is an illusion
There's something missing deep inside
I think you know
That there is only one solution
You're Father's waiting for you
With arms open wide
If you just believe
Then you will see He's all you need
Don't you think it's time to come back home
Back where you belong
There's more to this life
Than only tryin' to survive
Don't you think it's time to come back home
Back where you belong
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa...
Whoa-whoa-whoa...
Only time will tell
Just what your heart is sayin'
The final answer's up to you
There's no need to play
The games that you've been playin'
You've got to give Him everything
It's all that's left to do

For so long to work it out
Don't you know
You need to turn your life around?
If you just believe
Then you will see He's all you need

Back where you belong
