Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

He said goodbye to the angels of heaven
And He came to earth as a common man
He taught us how we could love one another
There was healing in His hands
There were those who believed and followed Him
And there were those who wanted Him dead
They thought the grave would silence Him forever
But they found out instead
You can close your eyes
You can say it's a lie
You can stick your head in the sand
You can turn away
Even try to explain
He was just another man
When they nailed Him to the cross
By His hands and His feet
And they put Him in the ground
Three days later
Everybody found out that you can't
No, you can't keep a good man down, no
No, you can't keep a good man down
You might also likeI hear you say that it all sounds crazy
It's a good story, but it can't be true
How could a man who was dead and buried
Mean a thing to me and you
Here we are two thousand years later
And still the choice is just the same
(It's just the same)
You can say that you don't believe it
But it doesn't change a thing
You can close your eyes
You can say it's a lie
You can stick your head in the sand
You can turn away
Even try to explain
He was just another man
(Oh, just a man)
When they nailed Him to the cross
By His hands and His feet
And they put Him in the ground
Three days later
Everybody found out that you can't
No, you can't keep a good man down, no
No, you can't keep a good man down
No, you can't keep
Can't keep a good man down
I can take you to the hill
Where they hung Him on the cross
I can take you to the empty tomb
I can tell you He's alive
'Cause He lives in me
But the rest is up to you
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
You can close your eyes
You can say it's a lie
You can stick your head in the sand
You can turn away
Even try to explain
He was just another man
(Oh, just a man)
When they nailed Him to the cross
By His hands and His feet
And they put Him in the ground
(Yeah, yeah)
Three days later
Everybody found out that you can't
No, you can't keep a good man down, no
No, you can't keep a good man down
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
