Whoa...
My cell phone's ringing
And I'm running late
Morning traffic's got me
Time is ticking away
A few more hours is all that I need
Seems like there is just not
Enough days in a week
But then it hits me
Time is not the answer
You've given me
All the time in the world
All that I need
Is a little more life in my day
Whoa, a little more of Your life
And a little more faith
Need a little more life in my day
Whoa, a little more of Your light
To show me the way
If I'm gonna be in this world
But not be of it
Lord, I need more of You
In all that I do
Put a little more life in my day

Sometimes I guess
I get lost in the race
Trying to make a deadline
Just to keep the pace
I can't help feelin'
I'm always behind
So much that I can do
If I could just find the time
But then it hits me
Time is not the answer
You've given me
All the time in the world
All that I need
Is a little more life in my day
Whoa, a little more of Your life
And a little more faith
Need a little more life in my day
Whoa, a little more of Your light
To show me the way
If I'm gonna be in this world
But not be of it
Lord, I need more of You
In all that I do
Put a little more life in my day
Lord, don't let me be in such a hurry
Trying to live my life
That I miss You in it
Help me to take the time to see
All that I need, yeah
Is a little more life in my day
Whoa, a little more of Your life
And a little more faith
Need a little more life in my day
Whoa, a little more of Your light
To show me the way
If I'm gonna be in this world
But not be of it
Lord, I need more of You
In all that I do
Put a little more life
Is a little more life in my day
Whoa, a little more of Your life
And a little more faith
Need a little more life in my day
Whoa, a little more of Your light
To show me the way
If I'm gonna be in this world
But not be of it
Lord, I need more of You
In all that I do
