I am a Christian and my name is Pilgrim
I'm on a journey but I'm not alone
Jesus is with me and He goes before me
And His love surrounds me, He's leading me Home

One step at a time for now
Just keep your feet on the ground
Don't lose your way chasing the crowd
Here's where your road begins
Don't stop don't settle in
Just tell yourself there's something more than this
Just tell yourself there's something more than this
Everybody say

I am a Christian and my name is Pilgrim
I'm on a journey but I'm not alone
Jesus is with me and He goes before me
And His love surrounds me, He's leading me Home
Walk o-on, walk o-on (Traveler)
Walk o-on, walk on

Head high keep your eyes above
Don't think of giving up
He brought you this far He won't stop now
Don't ever run away no matter what you face
Don't be afraid 'cause He will not back down
Remind yourself that He is with you now
And say

Walk on in your weakness
Walk on through the night
Walk on in the darkness
Till you see the Light
Remember who's with you
Remember He's strong
And when you are weary
He'll carry you on
Walk on in your weakness
Walk on through the night
Walk on in the darkness
Till you see the Light
And remember who's with you
Remember He's strong
And when you are weary
He'll carry you on!
