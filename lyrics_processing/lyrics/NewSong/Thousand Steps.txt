I saw her slowly start to stand
Her trembling hands
Wiped her tears away
She looked so tired and broken
She never lifts her head
She softly says
"I can't make it through another day
I'm as far away from God as I can be
Is there any way that He still loves me?
Can He still love me?"
If there were a thousand steps
Between you and God
And you could see no way
Across the great divide
Just take one step toward His loving arms
And He'll take nine hundred and ninety-nine
He slips into the back door
And he straightens up his tie
His bloodshot eyes
Tell of the night before
He comes here every Sunday
But his life is never changed
He's played the game
But he knows there's something more
You might also like"I'm so close but still so far away
And I can't live like this another day
Not another day"
If there were a thousand steps
Between you and God
And you could see no way
Across the great divide
Just take one step toward His loving arms
And He'll take nine hundred and ninety-nine
Yeah, He'll take nine hundred and ninety-nine
Maybe you think
That there's a place you can go
And He won't be there
He won't even care
Didn't you know
That there's no depth or height
To keep us from His amazing love?
And if there were a thousand steps
Between you and God
And you could see no way
Across the great divide
Just take one step toward His loving arms
And He'll take nine hundred and ninety-nine
Yeah, He'll take nine hundred and ninety-nine
Nine hundred and ninety-nine
Oh, take one step, yeah
Take one step, yeah
He'll cross the great divide
Nine hundred and ninety-nine
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Nine hundred and ninety-nine
