Friends in our lives
Who'll get down on their knees
And lift us up before the King of Kings
We all need sheltering trees
It's been said a friend is like
A mighty sheltering tree
A place of refuge we can run
When trouble comes for you and me
Someone we can count on
Through the thick and thin
When the storms of life are blowing
There's just nothing like a friend
There's just nothing like a friend
We all need sheltering trees
Friends in our lives
Who'll get down on their knees
And lift us up before the King of Kings
We all need sheltering trees

Na, na-na-na-na, na, na-na, na
Na, na-na-na-na, na, na-na, na
You might also likeThere've been days that I was sure
That I couldn't make it through
Clouds of doubt came rolling in
And I didn't know what I would do
I would've given in and said
I just can't go on
If it hadn't been for a friend
That helped me to be strong
Helped me to be strong
Can you sing
We all need sheltering trees
Friends in our lives
Who'll get down on their knees
And lift us up before the King of Kings
We all need sheltering trees

Ooh, yeah
You can face the highest mountain
And the climb won't feel so high
Or cross the darkest valley
And it won't seem so wide
Oh, nothing is impossible
When a friend is by your side, yeah
We all need sheltering trees
Friends in our lives
Who'll get down on their knees
And lift us up before the King of Kings
We all need sheltering trees

Friends in our lives
Who'll get down on their knees
And lift us up before the King of Kings
We all need sheltering trees
