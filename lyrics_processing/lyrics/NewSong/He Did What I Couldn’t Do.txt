And saw the pain that I was in
(We're havin' a lotta pain here)
My life was so confused
And blinded by my sin
He knew there was nothing
In this world that I could do
Thats why he sent His Son
To die for me and you, oh...
He did what I couldn't do
Went to the cross so I could be forgiven
He spent three days in the grave
To make my life worth livin'
And the wonder of salvation is
I could never be good enough
He did what I couldn't do
Some people think
They've got this whole thing figured out
Livin' right, doin' good
Is what they think life's all about
But they need to know
That there's an answer to their faith
They've got to know
That Jesus is the only way, oh...

To make my life worth livin'
And the wonder of salvation is
I could never be good enough
He did what I couldn't do
Make no mistake
This is not a fairy tale
One day everybody's
Gonna need some help
There's just no way
That we could make it by ourselves
He did what I couldn't do
Went to the cross so I could be forgiven
He spent three days in the grave
To make my life worth livin'
And the wonder of salvation is
