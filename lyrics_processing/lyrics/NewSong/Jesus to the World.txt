Prays for something she can eat
A single mom doing all she can
Finds herself out on the street
Will we see their need and hear their cries
Look at our watch and just walk on by
Or will we stop and take the time
To be Jesus in their lives
We need to be lambs that roar
We need to be eagles that soar
We need to be salt
We need to be light
We need to be Jesus to the world
We need to take love into the streets
Be willing to turn the other cheek
We need to be strong
We need to be weak
We need to be Jesus
Jesus to the world
Jesus came with a message
That would change the way we live
He showed us all by example
What the heart of heaven is
He saw our need and He heard our cry
Loved us so much that He gave His life
He taught us by His sacrifice
How we should live our lives

We need to be salt
We need to be light
We need to be Jesus to the world
We need to take love into the streets
Be willing to turn the other cheek
We need to be strong
We need to be weak
We need to be Jesus
Jesus to the world
We can talk and talk
About what is wrong
But that won't change one thing at all
We must take God's love
Where the hurting lived
'Cause that's what Jesus did
We need to be lambs that roar
Jesus to the world
We need to be lambs that roar
We need to be eagles that soar
We need to be salt
We need to be light
We need to be Jesus to the world
We need to take love into the streets
Be willing to turn the other cheek
We need to be strong
We need to be weak
We need to be Jesus
