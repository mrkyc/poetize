I never believed that I would concede
And let someone trample on me
You strung me along, I thought I was strong
But you were just gaslightin' me
I've opened my eyes and counted the lies
And now it is clearer to me
You are just a user and an abuser
Living vicariously
I never believed that I would concede
And get myself blown asunder
You strung me along, I thought I was strong
But now you have pushed me under
I've opened my eyes and counted the lies
And now it is clearer to me
You are just a user and an abuser
And I refuse to take it

Won't stand down, I'm growing stronger
Won't stand down, I'm owned no longer
Won't stand down, you've used me for too long
Now die alone

Now I'm coming back, a counterattack
I'm playin' you at your own game
I'm cutting you out, a shadow of doubt
Is gonna hang over your name
I've opened my eyes, I see your disguise
I will never see you the same
I know how to win before you begin
I'll shoot you before you take aim
Now I'm coming back, a counterattack
A psychological war
I'm cutting you in, I'm under your skin
Now I'm gonna settle the score
I've opened my eyes, I see your disguise
I will never see you the same
I know how to win before you begin
I'll shoot you before you take aim
You might also like
Won't stand down, I'm growing stronger
Won't stand down, I'm owned no longer
Won't stand down, you've used me for too long
Now die alone

Won't stand down
Breaking out
Won't stand down

Won't stand down, I'm growing stronger
Won't stand down, I'm owned no longer
Won't stand down, you've used me for too long
Now die alone

Won't stand down
