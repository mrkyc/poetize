Ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh
Remember
Ooh, I remember
And I wanna know

Where were you when I said I loved you?
And where were you when I cried at night?
Waitin' up, couldn't sleep without you
Thinkin' of all the times we shared

I remember when my heart broke
I remember when I gave up lovin' you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
I was sad and lonely
I remember when I walked out
I remember when I screamed I hated you
But somehow, deep inside, still lovin' you
Sad and lonely

No one knew all the pain I went through
All the love I saved deep in my heart for you
Didn't know where I would go, where I would be
But you made me leave
And plus my heart it just, it just kept tellin' me so

Oh, I remember when my heart broke
I remember when I gave up lovin' you
My heart couldn't take no more of you (I couldn't take no more)
I was sad and lonely
I remember when I walked out
I remember when I said I hated you
But somehow, deep inside, still lovin' you
So sad and lonely

There was nowhere else to go, oh
Nobody else to turn to, no
For the rest of my life
I promised myself I will love me first, genuinely

I remember when my heart broke
I remember when I gave up lovin' you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
I was sad and lonely
I remember when I walked out
I remember when I said I hated you
But somehow, deep inside, still lovin' you
Sad and lonely
I remember when I walked out
I remember when I gave up lovin' you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
So sad and lonely, hey
I remember when I stormed out
I remember when I gave up lovin' you
