I don't mind
Rushin' through traffic just to get dinner ready in time
And I, don't mind
Callin' when I'm late just to give you peace of mind
And I, don't mind
You stayin' out all night long, hangin' with the guys
But I do mind
When you look me right dead in the eye and you tell me lies

You see, it pays to tell the truth
Look at what you had to lose
Should think before you do, did you not know the rules?
You see, it pays to tell the truth
Feel so sorry for you
You coulda had it all
Too bad you gotta fall
Now you leave, now you leave with zero, nothing
Now you leave with zero, nada
Now you leave with zero
You see, it pays to tell the truth, but you didn't do it
Now you leave with zero, nothing
Now you leave with zero, oh, nada
Now you leave with zero
You see, it pays to tell the truth

Oh, why I tried
Giving you chances just to get your act right
And I, I tried
Everything from prayin' to breakin' things
To gettin' out of line
Those tears I've cried, they hurt so deep inside
They almost drained me dry
But now, it's time
For you to man up 'cause I'm takin' back what's mine

You see, it pays to tell the truth
Look at what you had to lose (Look, look at it)
Should think before you do (Think before it)
Did you not know the rules?
You see, it pays to tell the truth
Feel so sorry for you (Feel so sorry)
You coulda had it all, too bad you gotta fall
Now you leave, now you leave with zero, nothing
Now you leave with zero, nada
Now you leave with zero
You see, it pays to tell the truth, but you didn't do it
(What, what?) Now you leave with zero, nothing
(What, what?)
Now you leave with zero, oh, nada
Now you leave with zero
You see, it pays to tell the truth
I lie just to protect you, never to disrespect you
'Cause what we have was so 38 special
And it was times that I heard niggas test you
But I ain't even ask, I was waitin' to catch you
But you caught me and everything was on me
It was time to face the music, everything was on key
And them lies sounded good, didn't they?
Now you sick of me
Now I'm supposed to leave with zero, is you kiddin' me?
One minus one equals none
And if you gon' leave, then you might leave with some
But you gon' think about me every time you see my son
And I'ma think about you every time I see the sun, in the morning
It's gonna be times we get caught up in the moment
But don't turn your back on the man you belong with
(Belong with)
'Cause if you lose. then I lose too
And if you cool, then I'm cool too

Now you leave, now you leave with zero, nothing (With nothing)
(What, what?) Now you leave with zero, oh, nada
Now you leave with zero (What, what?)
You see, it pays to tell the truth, but you didn't do it
Now you leave with zero, oh, nothing
Now you leave with zero, oh, nada
Now you leave with zero
You see, it pays to tell the truth, oh
Tell, tell the truth
Tell, tell the truth
