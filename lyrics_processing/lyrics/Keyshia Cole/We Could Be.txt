Oh, yeah, yes
Ooh
Can I talk to you for a minute?
There's something on my mind that I wanna say

Ooh, reality is, takin' control of me
'Cause I know, baby
I know that you're lovin' me (Ooh)
Ooh, lovin' you, boy
I wanna contradict my word
I belong with you, I do truly wanna know (Wanna know)

When you hear me talkin', what you think? (Ooh)
When you're lookin' into my eyes, what you see? (Oh yeah)
I know you ain't tryna to be my man
What you think about us bein' friends, makin' plans?
To be everything we wanna be
Makin' our dreams turn reality
I'm diggin' everything you appear to be
And I'm wonderin' if we could be real good good friends

So emotional, you know I am
That's why you do me the way you do me
If you be cool wit' me
You'll see, that I'm all you need
And all that you dream, and never would leave
You'll be right by my side forever
Swear to God we'll grow old together
Then reality would be you and me
