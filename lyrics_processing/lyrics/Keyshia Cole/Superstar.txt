Whoa, ooh, yeah, superstar, whoa, superstar
Talk to me, baby
(One, two, three, four)

Rollin' with my window dropped
Wind blowin', about six o'clock
Then this feeling came over me
Got to find myself a pretty young thing
(One, two, three, four)
So I took a left on the next block
Saw this shorty so I had to stop
Girl was looking as fine as could be, yeah
I said, "Do you wanna ride with me?"
(One, two, three, four)

Your car is lookin' real smooth
And you lookin' kinda cute, too
But boy, I don't even know you
Where the hell you think we goin' to?
Girlfriend had a little spark
So I parked the car and just walked
I don't mean no disrespect, love
I'm just tryin' to see what you're made of
(One, two, three, four)
