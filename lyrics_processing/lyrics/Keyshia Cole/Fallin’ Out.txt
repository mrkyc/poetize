Been sittin' thinkin' 'bout you and I
And wonderin' why we're not getting along
So frustrated 'cause what we had was a happy home
I don't know what the situation is, but I can tell in the way we kiss
We don't talk no more; it feels better when I'm alone

Sometimes I feel like there's no getting through to you
Like you don't appreciate all that I do
You gotta show me that you want me to stay
Don't turn and walk away

Baby, I'm slowly fallin' out of love with you
I don't know what to do
How did we end up here this way?
What are we gonna do?
I'm slowly fallin' out
Baby, we're trippin' on silly things
Boy, I need you to meet me halfway
If you want me to be with you

I remember when, I'd be with my friends
You checked on me and made time to call
But how things have changed
Now I don't hear from you at all
Yeah, yeah, yeah
