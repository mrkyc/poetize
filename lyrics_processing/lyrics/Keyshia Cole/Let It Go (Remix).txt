You need to get if he don't wanna (Ey, ey, Keyshia Cole)
LOVE you the right way, he ain't gonna (What's happening, shawty? ey, ey, Grand Hustle)
It ain't where he's at, it's where he (You know me, it's the king)
Where he wanna be, yeah, yeah
(Young Dro, New Dro, this our new album, B, remix)

Face it, I'm messin' around with lil' shawty (Lil' shawty)
She be at the mall, bustin' it down wit lil' shawty (Ay, what you do?)
I took her out the Cabo and shot that Balenciaga (Damn)
I show 'em how that Vu' tatin' look up in the Gallardo
Why doe? My girl, she ain't makin' me feel right (Okay)
I mess around with shawty, she be makin' me feel like (Yes)
I could have somethin', so we bond and let it go
But after a while, you gon' have to go on and let it go

I understand why you wanna try
To make him stay home late at night
But if he wanna go, he'll be gone, no lie
I can't explain how many times I tried
How many times I cried
Thinkin' about mine and where he might be
(Baby, I don't wanna know)
Remember when I gave everything I got
Couldn't get deep down inside
How you love someone who didn't love me? (C'mon)
But now I get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way, he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at, it's where he, where he wanna be

See, you been tryna make me feel like
You don't love me anymore (Anymore)
And you've been tryna make me feel that
You don't need me, ANY-more (Anymore)
But baby, I won't let you play games
You wanna leave, then you can go! (You can go)
I know you heard him, it ain't where he's at
It's where he wanna be
Grand hustle, grand hustle, grand hustle
Grand hustle remix! It's smashin'
The phone stay ringin'
Even though my gurl got a ten-carrot rang and them stones stay blingin' (Bling!)
Them hoes stay schemin' (Wha?), I see it in they eye
When I'm leanin' in the ride, 'cause the chrome stay gleamin'
See, I'm champagne wishin' (I see ya), caviar dreamin'
To kick it wit the King, they are really a-fiendin'
So they laugh for no reason (What?), drops all hatin' (Okay)
Wishin' they was in your situation
So that why we take two vacations
One wit all the kids, then one wit all the strippers that ya crew stay chasin'
Chillin' in a Camry (Okay), far away from fame
And all the other situation weighin' heavy on the brain
And now we Margarita drankin' (Drankin'), champagne poppin' (Oop!)
All night, pool parties got big thangs poppin' (Hey)
Six G's in the pool, just get naked 'fore you hop in
Tops and bottoms, hoes spot, just holla - ay!

If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
Then let it go
(If he ain't gonna) If he ain't gonna treat you, the way he should
Then let it go

Then let it go (Let it go)
If he ain't gonna treat you, the way he should
Then let it go
