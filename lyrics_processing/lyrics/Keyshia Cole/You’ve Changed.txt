(Sounds like a love song, sounds like a love song)
I already heard your side of the story; hear mine
I'ma tell you why
'Cause you changed (Baby, you changed)
When you got dough (You got dough and changed)
Nah nah nah, uh-uh, no, you listen ('Cause I do)

I remember like yesterday the very day I met you
You were lookin' fly, I was actin' shy
So when you walked on by, I ignored you
But then you turned around and asked my name
In an instant, my attitude changed
Swept me off my feet, you were so sweet
Full of comedy, you amused me
Gave you my number, next day you called
Askin' if you can see me (See me)
So I said, "Alright, you can stop on by"
It gave me butterflies
Thirty minutes, knock knock, it's you
I'm glad to see you, but I keep my cool
From day one, I fell in love with you
But now I ask myself, "Who are you?"
Because

You changed, you changed
You got dough and changed
You got dough and you changed
Baby, you changed
It wasn't the same
You got dough and changed
You got dough and you changed
What was I to do?

You were never there
Why should I be there?
There's no one there to hold me
I'm young at heart and age, and these are the days
When a girl like me needs lovin'
(If he's not, then someone else is getting what he calls his)
He wasn't taking care of home (Home), left me there alone ('Lone)
So what's a girl to do when she's feeling in the mood?
We were together, but we grew apart
Thinkin' with my mind and not my heart
Packed up all my things, left the engagement ring
'Cause from the looks of things, I can't do this
Live this life that I call my life
If this is what it's like being your wife
I'd rather be your friend then through thick and thin
But now it's the end of my sufferin', yeah, yeah, yeah
You changed, you changed
You got dough and changed
(You got dough and changed, baby)
You got dough and you changed (It wasn't the same)
Baby, you changed
It wasn't the same
('Cause you got dough and changed)
You got dough and you changed
Oh, what was I to do? (What was I to do?)

Sit around and wait for you to call
When I wanted to be in your arms
Missing you every minute you were gone
You were gone too long
Doin' who knows what, who knows where
You act like you didn't care when I told you
I wouldn't be here, 'cause you changed

You changed, you changed
(You know you changed, yeah)
You got dough and changed
You got dough and you changed
Baby, you changed (It wasn't the same)
It wasn't the same
(You got dough and changed, baby)
You got dough and you changed
What was I to do?
No, it ain't about the cars with the rims or the rings
No, it ain't about the lies and houses and minks
Perpetrating with the clothes, broken promises, please
No, ain't about the life that you given to me
No, it ain't about it
No, it ain't about it
(Oh no, what was I to do, baby?)
No, it ain't about the cars with rims or the rings
No, it ain't about the lies and houses and minks
Perpetrating with the clothes, broken promises, please
No, ain't about the hype that you given to me
No, it ain't about it
(You've changed, you've changed, you've changed, you've changed)
