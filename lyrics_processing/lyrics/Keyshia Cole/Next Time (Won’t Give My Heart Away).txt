Fighting and the arguing and the cussing all loud
Sometimes I think you do It just so you can walk out
And you saying plenty things that you really don't mean or do you really mean it
Cause It hurt
Then I say some foul shit just so I can hit back
But I don't mean it, We done went to far
Damn I think It's over

Next time, I won't throw my heart away, Again
I just won't (No I won't)
Next time I won't throw my heart away, Again

Seem kind of crazy saying you love me so much
How could bring that women into our home
Where my baby lay, Damn right It's over
The crazy part about is I took you right back (Right Back)
I thought you were a changed man
I tried to work It out for the sake of our family
(ooooh ooh oooh) But you took my kindness for weakness
And my love for granted (oooh)
I should of known then if you'd do it once
You'd do it again
Next Time...
