(A thousand kisses from you)
Let's go (A thousand kisses from you)
Uh, come on, come on
Never too much, never too much

You're tellin' me we're cool, but that just ain't enough
'Cause everything that you do makes me want you more
Feelings that I have for you can't be replaced easily
But you seem to think that you have the best of me

(But) My love is closed for you
Let nobody enter
Even when I'm with someone, ain't the same when I'm with ya
Please tell me that you're listenin'
Please tell me that you're hearin' me
'Cause I'm gonna be here always

Even if you give me all your love
Even if you give me all your kisses
It will be never
(Never too much, never too much)
Oh, yeah, yeah
Even if you give me all your love
Even if you give me all your kisses
It will be never
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)

But every time I see you, boy, ooh, what you do to me
Make my body shiver lips, quiver when I say your name
Lovin' you is like an emotional ride
Dare to stay?

But my love is closed for you
Let nobody enter

Got my heart in your hands and I think you know
Can't put a price on my love and the way you grow
I think I melt inside when you look in my eyes
Baby, all I see in you fuck, them niggas who try
Don't ever worry 'bout my loyalty
Try the others and I'm cool

Been through the telephone arguments
