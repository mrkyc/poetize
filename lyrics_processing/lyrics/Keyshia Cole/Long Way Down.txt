Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, it's a long, long, long, long, long way down
Baby, it's a long, long, long, long, long way down (Baby)
Baby, it's a long, long, long, long, long way down (Long way)
Baby, it's a long, long, long, long, long way down (Ooh)
(J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League)

I'm young but I can't hide the tracks of my tears from cryin'
Broken hearts develop a fear of flyin'
I pray somebody take me higher
I've already fell for a liar
Can't make the same mistake twice
Then on a lonely night

Just when I said (I said)
That I (That I) was through (Was through) with love
There he was (Yeah)
Telling me he saw my S.O.S
That's when I said that I
Was saving myself for true love from above (Yeah)
And before I let you hurt me like the rest, boy

Don't show me how you kiss, or where the angels live
You know it's a long way down from there
Just to call it quits, 'cause that ain't what love is
You know it's a long way down from there
Baby, it's a long, long, long, long, long way down
(Fallin' from Heaven)
Baby, it's a long, long, long, long, long way down
(Fallin' from Heaven)

Already had me a cheater and mistreater
Already been with a flosser and smooth talker
I've had a betrayer, somethin' like a player (No)
But that ain't what I want no more (What you lookin' for?)
Come get my lovin', don't date me for your reputation
If you ain't made a decision not to keep it pimpin' (No)
Keep it movin', don't even waste your time
'Cause I don't want you wasting mine

When I said (I said) that I (That I)
Was through (Was through) with love
There he was (Yeah)
Telling me he saw my S.O.S
That's when I said that I
Was saving myself for true love from above (Yeah)
But before I let you hurt me like the rest, boy

Don't show me how you kiss, or where the angels live
You know it's a long way down from there
Just to call it quits, 'cause that ain't what love is (You know)
You know it's a long way down from there
Baby, it's a long, long, long, long, long way down

Baby, it's a long, long, long, long, long way down

I know, sometimes you don't know
The one before you be the right one
But I know you're the right one for me
And if you know, I'm the right one for you
Baby, slow jam, throw your hands up
And lets dance, don't wait any longer
(Don't wait, don't wait)
But if ain't real

Don't show me how you kiss, or where the angels live
(Oh, you know)
You know it's a long way down from there
Just to call it quits, 'cause that ain't what love is
(You know, oh)
You know it's a long way down from there
Baby, it's a long, long, long, long, long way down
(Fallin' from Heaven)
So baby, it's a long, long, long, long, long way down
(I don't wanna fall no more)

You know it's a long way down from there
You know it's a long way down from there
