Ooh, ooh, oh
Baby

First of all let me say
You can't accuse me of all the things
You know that you are guilty of
And I see
That it is easy for you to blame everything on me
If that's the case, I should go have my fun
And do all the things you say I do
Boy, I can't continue to take this from you

I might as well have cheated on you (You)
As much as you accused me of cheatin'
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lyin'
I might as well have gone to the club
(I might as well, might as well)
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
(I might as well, might as well)
I might as well have thrown away my love
As much as you accused me
I should have cheated

You say I was out with somebody else
When my girl told me she saw you with some girl (Some girl)
But I didn't
Accuse you of something that I didn't see myself (See myself)
Realize that I would never do anything to disrespect you
Trust me, you gotta stop accusing me
I might as well have cheated on you (Might as well, oh)
As much as you accused me of cheatin'
I might as well have lied to you (Oh)
As much as you accused me of lyin'
I might as well have gone to the club (Oh)
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have thrown away my love (Oh)
As much as you accused me

Don't you know I wish I knew
That you would treat me this way
If you don't promise me
That you'll change your ways, I'm leaving today
And I ain't coming back
And you made it like that
Was unfair to me
All this jealousy
I'm your everything
What will you do without me?
Why you trippin'?
I might as well have cheated on you (Oh baby)
As much as you accused me of cheatin'
('Cause I might as well have)
I might as well have lied to you (Oh)
As much as you accused me of lyin' (Baby, baby)
I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have thrown away my love
(I should have gave it all away)
As much as you accused me
I should have cheated

I shoulda lied
I shoulda cheated
Maybe I should have went out to the club
Or maybe I, I shoulda done it
Shoulda given away all my love
Or maybe I, I should've played you
'Cause you don't appreciate me, no
And I tried to stay down with you
But you're making it hard for me

I might as well have cheated on you (Can't you see, baby?)
As much as you accused me of cheatin' (Ooh)
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lyin' (But I didn't)
I might as well have gone to the club ('Cause I love you)
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
(I might as well, might as well)
I might as well have thrown away my love (Baby)
As much as you accused me
I should have cheated
As much as you accused me of cheatin'
I should have cheated (Ooh)
As much as you accused me of lyin' (Whoa, lyin', lyin')
As much as you accused me of clubbin', clubbin', clubbin'
(I love you)
As much as you accused me of cheatin'
I should have cheated
I should have cheated
I should have cheated
