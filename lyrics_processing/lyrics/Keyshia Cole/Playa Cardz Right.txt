(Ooh-ooh) Wassup, boo? (Yeah)
Hahahaha, yeah, that's right

Another shady mission (Ooh)
Tricks, like watching pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love making, take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see 'em grow?
Though I don't know
I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go
No broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in Heaven, 'cause bein' here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothin' but pain, the world is crazy
Still, looking for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right

I wanna be the one who (Hahaha)
Who you can depend on who (Playa cards right)
Who'll be the one who'll be there (Take your time)
(Who'll be the one) Through the thick and thin (Be patient)
Oh, go by the water, we will (Don't rush)
Be there 'til the morning
We won't leave until the night (It's goin' down)
And we will be forever more
