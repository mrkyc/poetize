Okay, follow me
One, two, three, one, two, three
Yeah, oh, whoa, oh, ooh, ahh

So many things he does for me
Such a provider, he cares for me
Wish I could give him all of me
But I can't, can't let you go

I tried hating you, but I just love you more
Compared him to you, but he can't match your score
In this game of love, there's no rules
When it comes to us, I choose you

If it ain't you, it's not worth it
No matter what I do, nothing's working
Baby, I know love's not perfect
Even if he can save the world, that will never be enough
'Cause I choose you, I choose you
And if it ain't you, then it's just not worth it

I heard you found you another
But she's not me, how could you love her?
We've got history, we were meant to be
She can't replace what we had based on chemistry

Don't care what she do, she can never match my score
In this game of love, there's no rules

Can't give up
I'ma keep on trying to get your love
No sense in denying, you had my heart
I'm not over you, whatever it takes, I'm gon' do

Even if he can save the world, that will never be enough
(It don't matter, baby)
'Cause I choose you (You), I choose you
(I don't want nobody else, baby)
And if it ain't you (Baby, then it's not)
Then it's just (No) not worth it (No, no, no, no, no, no)
