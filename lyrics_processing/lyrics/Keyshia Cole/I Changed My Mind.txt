There's this girl I know, so deep in love (In love)
Do almost anything to make him see she's the one
But he doesn't feel a girl like her, he's so so wrapped up
'Cause the average girl will give him anything that he wants

He's so caught up (He's so caught up)
He won't call her, he shows no love
So she decides

I changed my mind, ooh
(I don't love you) I don't love you
(I don't love you no more)
No, no, no, no, no
Don't waste my time (Don't waste my time)
(I don't love you)
(I don't love you no more) No no
(Bring it back, bring it back, baby)
