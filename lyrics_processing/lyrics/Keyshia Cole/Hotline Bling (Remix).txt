Late night when she need your love
Call you on your cellphone
Late night when she need your love
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
I know when your hotline bling
It could only mean one thing
Ever since I left the crib, you, you
Started feeling sorry for yourself now
It's crazy how you had me feeling left out
And everybody knows you left me stressed out
Ever since I left the crib, you
Started caring less and going out more
Hanging with these girls all on the dancefloor
Chilling with these girls I never seen before
I never seen before
You used to call her on her cellphone
Late night when you need her love
Call her on her cellphone
Late night when you need her love
I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing
I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing

Don't seem to care about who  you with now
You got me feeling like I did you wrong
Going places that you don't belong
Ever since I left the crib, you, you, you
You got exactly exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your blackbook
Chilling with these girls I never seen before
I never seen before
I used to call you on your cellphone
Late night when I needed your love
Call you on your cellphone
Late night when you need my love
I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing
I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing
These days all I do is wonder if you're bending over backwards for someone else
Taking Patron shots with someone else
Doing things we did, getting freaky with someone else
You just need someone else, I can't be by myself
Oh, why you never alone? Always with these hoes
Used to be at home, be a good man, you were in the zone
You should just be yourself, right now you're someone else
She used to call you on your cellphone
Late night when she need your love
Call you on your cellphone
Late night when she need your love
I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing
I peep when that hotline bling
It could only mean one thing
You know the love that we shared
You know what we had was rare
You know the way that I cared
And  I gave up, you wasn't there
Niggas be lying, two at a time
I heard voice up in my line, line, line
I heard voice up in my line
Thought you were mine, so out of line, line, line
