Let's go

Just to think about it
I would do things that I would regret (Tryna get you to)
To understand how I felt for you
I tried real hard time and time again
But I didn't know
My love wouldn't grow, I shoulda just let it go
But I stayed around, thinkin' you would learn to love

And we both knew, you're wrong
There's nothing you can do, to ever undo what you've done to me
I loved you, deep in my heart, I know you couldn't love me
But baby, I just kept holding on, I shoulda let you go
I shoulda let you go
I shoulda let you go
I shoulda let you go

Couldn't do without it
Felt I needed you in my world (To get me by, by)
More and more, I looked out for you
You tried to play me like a fool, so I
Didn't care that love wasn't there, had to just let it go
(Couldn't) Stay around, thinking you would learn to love

And we both knew, you're wrong
There's nothing you can do, to ever undo what you've done to me (Done to me)
I loved you, deep in my heart (Heart I know)
I know you couldn't love me
But baby, I just kept holding on, I should've let you go
I shoulda let you go (Hey, yeah, yeah)
I shoulda let you go
You know, I shoulda let you go

And now I'm gone, plus I'd rather be alone
We both grown, lower your tone over the phone, aight
I shoulda known, damn, I shoulda known
It wouldn't last long, when you didn't come home some nights
And now I'm on, in the zone, handle business on my own
So respect the queen on the throne, aight
Here's some strong advice, move on, that's life
You're wrong, I'm right, and I'm glad I let you go

And we both knew, you're wrong (Knew you're wrong)
There's nothing you can do, to ever undo what you've done to me (Done to me)
I loved you, deep in my heart (I loved you deep in my heart)
I know you couldn't love me
But baby, I just kept holding on, I shoulda let you go
I shoulda let you go
I shoulda let you go
You know, I shoulda let you go
Don't know why you would ever lie to me so
(But I shoulda let you)
Don't know why I could never let you go
(Could've, shoulda, let you)
Don't know why you would ever lie to me so (Shoulda let you go)
Don't know why I could never let you go

(Shoulda let ya, I shoulda let you go, hey, oh)
Don't know why I could never let you go (But I shoulda let you)
Everything I did, everything I gave (Shoulda let you go)
You didn't understand, no
(Don't know why I would never let you go)
Coulda, shoulda let you
But I shoulda let you
Baby, oh, I shoulda let you go a long time ago
