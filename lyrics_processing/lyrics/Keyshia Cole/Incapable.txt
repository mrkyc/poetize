Its time to grow up
I embarrass myself enough
Cause I wouldn't leave you ooh
Even my family know the truth yeah yeah

You've taken me under
Round in circles like you know you do
I've called on my brothers
They said don't call me till you know you're really through

But every time it feels like
This could be the last time
Where's the good in goodbye
If I give this one more try
Its hard cause they say that if its true love it never dies

Oh what a oh what a feeling
The one that I thought that I needed
Was Incapable incapable of needing me back
Incapable incapable of loving like that

Mmm incapable
You are incapable

My number will be changed
You'll always be someone
That I know before the pain, hey yeah

But every time it feels like
This could be the last time
Where's the good in goodbye
If I give this one more try
Its hard cause they say that if its true love it never dies

Oh what a oh what a feeling
The one that I thought that I needed
Was Incapable incapable of needing me back
Incapable incapable of loving like that
Oh what a oh what a feeling
The one that I thought that I needed
Was Incapable incapable of needing me back
Incapable incapable of loving like that

It was only me
Making a fool of me
Even though it wasn't meant to be
Still I don't regret a thing
Cause it shaped and molded me
Oh what a oh what a feeling
The one that I thought that I needed
Was Incapable incapable of needing me back
(you were all incapable)
Incapable incapable of loving like that
(I said all I neeeed ooooooh)
Oooh ooh ooh incapable
Incapable
You were incapable
