I don't wanna lose what I came to prove (It's everything)
I expect myself to be
And I'm gonna do everything I set out to
Making my dreams come true
It means so much to me

You could never understand
How I feel when I'm searching for the words to say
And I don't wanna be nobody else
Take the time and get to know me (The real me)
And you will see, yeah

(I'm just like you)

(I'm just like you)
Tryna live my life and take care of mine
(I'm just like you, you)

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

I wanna be the one who you can depend on
And when it feels so bad, know I can handle it
'Cause I've been through so much, oh
It's so much I've overcome
I had to look inside of me and see just who's inside of me
And know who I need was me
(Ooh, it took so much for me just to see it's all in me)
