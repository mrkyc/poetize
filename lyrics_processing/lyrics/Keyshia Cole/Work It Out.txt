(Aye, aye, aye, aye)
Damn, I'm sorry you had to find out like that
(Aye, aye, aye, aye)
Wait a minute
Can we talk a minute? Oh
I'm sorry you had to find out this way

There's this guy I've been seein', hold on though
Every time I close my eyes, he's in my thoughts
We've been going through it for some time now
It ain't my fault, no
I'm just tryna be truthful to you
And let you know

Every time I try to leave, something always tells me no
And just when I think it's working itself out, can't be so
Everything we worked so hard for, should we let it go?
It's no fair to leave without tryna work it out

And there's someone else you've been seeing
I ain't a fool, no
And it's been going on for some time now
It's so obvious
Now she's been taking my place some of the time that you've been gone, yeah
Why won't you just be truthful to me, yeah, and let me know
(Truthful, no)
