Oh girl, the way you do me all night long
Work my love around and make it all come down
You give me that tasty love
Oh yeah

Oh girl, you touch a special part of me
A part no one else has ever seen
Oh girl, such a feeling that is so intense
I had no defense
Girl, when you look at me
I can tell you see right through me
'Cause I lose control of my heart and soul
Girl, when you're next to me
Your sensitivity inside you keeps me yearning

Darling, when it's right, it's right, it's alright
Darling, keep it there, right there, ooh yeah

Oh girl, the way you do me in the morning
Oh, ooh girl, the way you love me all night long
Work my love around and make it all come down
You give me that tasty love, mhm
The way you rub me down soothes me all around
You give me that tasty love, oh yeah

Every part of me you can fulfill

Once you get me going, going
Girl, I'm gone, gone, gone
