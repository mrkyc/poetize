Learning to stand at last on my two feet alone
To know for sure just once that I
Was not like a candle in the wind that can't survive
But proving this I turned and found
That it's only love that makes the world go 'round
And I don't want to live my life without you
Not for the cause of wrong or right
Not another lonely night
No, I don't want to live my life without you
Living without your love is like no life at all
Ooh-ooh-ooh...
Sometimes the truth is hard to see
So many fools in love are blind to destiny, oh, tell me
I tried in every way I knew
To hide away from all the things I felt for you
But heaven help the heart in flight, now
There's no place on earth to run once love decides
And I don't want to live my life without you
Though I could make it through somehow
I want you here, I want you now
No, I don't want to live my life without you
Living without your love is like no life at all

And can we really take the chance to trust them
Still while we wait, those moments spin on the clock
The moments that we'll never find again
No, I don't want to live my life without you
Not for the cause of wrong or right
Not another lonely night
No, I don't want to live my life without you
Living without your love is like no life at all
And I don't want to live my life without you
Though I could make it through somehow
I want you here, I want you now
No, I don't want to live my life without you
Living without your love is like no life at all
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Not another lonely night
