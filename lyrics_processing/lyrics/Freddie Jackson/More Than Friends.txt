Finally, you're my lady
Girl, you don't know
How you mean the whole world to me
Can't believe that you're my baby
Was longing for you so patiently

It's funny how love will hear what say
'Cause when you're not looking
(It's when it comes your way)
How you help me get over my pain
'Cause you're in my life
And we're more than friends

Yes, we are
We are more than friends
We are more
I'll never love this way again
We are
So much more than friends
We are more
So let this newfound love begin

Is you put the 'S' in my soul
Hear my heart beating for two

There was a time when you were not in my life
How you help me get over my pain
'Cause you're in my life
And we're more than friends

Yes, we are
We are more than friends
We are more
I'll never love this way
Never love this way again, baby, no
