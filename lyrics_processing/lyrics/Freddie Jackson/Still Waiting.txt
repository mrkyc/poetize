Oh-oh...
(I'm still waiting)
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
(Waiting)
Oh-oh...
(I'm still waiting)
I'm, ooh...
I just couldn't get it through my head
You'll leave me all alone
This just wasn't like you
To break our happy home
I can't believe that it's true
I'm still here waiting for you
This may sound foolish, I know
But I can't seem to let it go
So, baby, I'm waiting
I wait for your returning
I'm still waiting
The flame of love is still burning
Waiting
I hear that patience is a virtue
I'm still waiting
Ooh, but I can't live without you
You might also likeI can't find no peace of mind
The days are endless
I feel so empty inside
I know that this waiting is senseless
It's such a silly game
Each day and night I call your name
If you knew what you'd done
Maybe you'd come home where you belong
Till then, I'm waiting
I wait for your returning
I'm still waiting
Ooh, the flame of love's still burning
Waiting
I hear that patience is a virtue
I'm still waiting
Ooh, but I can't live without you
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, mmm...
I can't believe that it's true
I'm still here waiting for you
This may sound foolish, I know
But I can't seem to let you go
It's such a silly game
Each day and night I call your name
But if you knew what you'd done
Then maybe you'd come home
Where you belong
Till then, I'm waiting
Oh, waiting on your return
I'm still waiting
Can't you see
The flame of love's still burning
Waiting
I hear that patience is a virtue
I'm still waiting
Oh, but I can't live without your love
Waiting
I'm waiting on your return
I'm still waiting
Don't make me wait too, too long
Waiting
I waited all day, I waited all night
Come on back to me
I'm still waiting
Oh, I'm waiting on you
Waiting
Come on home where you belong
Come on back to me
I'm still waiting
