Though it's been a year
I remember when I first heard your name
Janay
Still I get the rush
That I get that day I laid eyes on you
Janay

Memories flood my mind, seems like yesterday
Get chills up and down my spine
How can I go on feeling this way?
How can I go on another day?

Janay, Janay, how could something so right go so wrong?
Janay, how could I let your beauty slip away?
Janay, to get you back there's nothing I would not pay
Oh, Janay

When I think back on, on the good times
That I shared with you
Janay
Oh, it makes me sad 'cause you're somewhere else
There's nothing I can do
Janay
You might also like
Memories flood my mind seems like yesterday
It chills up and down my spine
How can I go on feeling this way?
How can I go on another 'nother day?

Janay, Janay, how could something so right go so wrong?
Janay, how could I let your beauty slip away?
Janay, to get you back there's nothing I would not pay
Oh, Janay


Janay
Janay, how could something so right go so wrong?
Janay, how could I let your beauty slip away?
Janay, to get you back there's nothing I would not pay
Oh, oh, Janay

(Why, why?) Why did you leave me? Why did you go?
(Janay, why, why?) You see, baby, I remember
(Janay, why, why?) The walks we used to take and all the love we used to make
(Janay, why, why?) Oh, why, why, why, baby?
(Janay, why, why?) It's getting harder, it's getting harder every day for me
(Janay, why, why?) To live without your sweet love, baby, ah, yes it is
(Janay, why, why?) I remember you and me whispering
(Janay, why, why?) Sweet loving things in each other's ear
I don't know how I made it, how I made it through the year
