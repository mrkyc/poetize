It's been too long since we had touched like this
So we jump right in
It's like heaven on earth again
When I'm with you, baby
I don't care if you've got somebody else at home
I don't care who might say that it ain't right
This is our only change to be alone
Honey, you can be his forever
But you gotta be mine tonight
Just love me down from head to toe
Let's cherish the moment and never let go
Just love me down nice and slow
When it's seems like it's over
Just love me some more
And some more and some more
(Just love me down)
Ah, stay with me
Feelings never die
You excite me now more
Than you ever did before
Bottled up inside
Is a passion I can't contain anymore, baby
You might also likeI won't ask you to make me any promises
That I know in my heart you can't keep
All that I ask is that you give me tonight
What I always dream of when I go to sleep
Just love me down from head to toe
Let's cherish the moment
And never let go, oh, baby now
Now just love me down nice and slow
When it's seems like it's over
Just love me some more
And some more, oh, baby
Only you can satisfy me
Baby, say that you won't deny me
Let's make tonight our very special one
Ooh, and now that we started this fire
We are slaves to our desire
We can't stop when we began
Baby, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, oh...
(Just love me down)
(Just love me down)
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just love me down from head to toe
Cherish the moment, never let go
Just love me down nice and slow
(All the way down, nice and slow)
Seems like it's over, love me some more
M-m-more, more, more, more, more
(Just love me down)
(Just love me down)
Mmm, come on, baby
I said, come on, baby, yeah
(Just love me down)
Come on
(Just love me down)
Want you to love me down
Want you to love me down, baby
Sweet baby, yeah
(Just love me down)
Don't leave me, baby
Don't leave me, girl
You can ignite, excite
