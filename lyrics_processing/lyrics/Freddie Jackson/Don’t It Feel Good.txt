Uh-huh

Freddie
Yeah
Are you ready?
Hello, baby
You're looking mighty fine tonight
Glad that we could spend some time together
I'm gonna make you feel right
This animal attraction
Is an powerful thing
It takes a physical reaction
To ease the pressure
Can you feel my body heat
Don't it feel good all over
Don't it make you feel nice
Don't it feel good all over
Makes you want to testify, yeah
Don't it feel so good, so good
Tell me now
Don't it feel good
Oh, girl, oh, yeah

If you really want my kissing
Just say, Freddie, I'm ready
