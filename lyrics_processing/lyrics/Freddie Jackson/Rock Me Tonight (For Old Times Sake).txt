Hey, girl, long time no see
Do you have a little time to spend with me?

In your life, huh
Talk to me, baby
Your hair, perfume you wear brings back memories
Oh, of you and me
You look so fine
You blow my mind all over again, ooh, ooh

So much has happened in my life since we parted
What about you?
And now I've got myself together
And I know just what I want
And right now I know that it's you, you

Rock me tonight for old times sake
Would you, baby? Hey
Roll with me tonight for old times sake

To get in the mood, ooh, woo, yes, you do, yeah
But once you're in the mood
You like to go straight to the groove

Fire and desire
Will burn in you forevermore, more
