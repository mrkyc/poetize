It's nice to see ya
You're looking as sweet as can be
You blow my mind baby with your style
It's been far too long
So It's hard to believe
You know I've always loved your smile
Can we spend some time
Have a glass of wine
Baby unwind
It's what I've been waiting for
I can't take it anymore
Won't let this chance slip away
Give me one night
(If you give me one night)
Girl you won't believe
It'll feel like New Years Eve
Give me one night
(If you give me one night)
Let me show you what's in store
Love's guaranteed for sure
I'll be your DJ, yea
I'll play your favorite songs
You know we'll dance
All night long
Whatever you want
It's your call
I'll do what I can
Give you my all
If we spend some time
Have a glass of wine
And baby unwind
I can't take it anymore
You're what I've been waiting for
Won't let this chance slip away
