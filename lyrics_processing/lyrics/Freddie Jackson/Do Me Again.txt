In the morning, by moon, by stars, by candlelight
Do me again
Give me
Have mercy, no don't mercy me
Do me again

Ooh, it feels so good being here with you, yes
Being close to you is what I wanna do, yes
Just can't seem to get enough of your love, baby
The way you do that thing you do, what a rush

Every bit of you is what I need
So don't hold back, not on me, no

In the morning and all through the night
By moon, stars, by candlelight
Do me again (Do me again)
Give me all your fantasies (Your fantasies)
Have mercy, no don't mercy me
(Don't, don't mercy me)
Do me again
You might also like
I have to go, but I can't get myself together
As long as you keep giving good love
The way you do

What I have to do just has to wait
Right now I just can't leave you, no

In the morning and all through the night
By moon, stars, by candlelight
Do me again (Do me again), baby
Give me all your fantasies (Your fantasies)
Have mercy, no don't mercy me (Don't mercy me)
Do me again
Do me in the morning
(Come on, baby)
Come on
All through the night
(Oh, baby, baby, baby)
Come on
(Sugar)
And do, do, do-do
Do, do, do-do me
Every bit of you is what I need
So don't hold back on me
No, n-n-no, no
In the morning
Give me

In the morning and all through the night (In the morning)
By moon, by stars, by candlelight (Yeah, c'mon)
Do me again, yeah, yeah (Do me again, baby, ba-baby, baby, baby)
Give me all your fantasies (Give me every single one of your fantasies)
Have mercy, no don't mercy me (Don't mercy me)
Do me again (Don't have no mercy, don't have no mercy)
Ooh, do me
C'mon and do, do me
One more time, one more time
'Fore the night is through, hey
