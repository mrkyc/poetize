Come on
Just a little closer, baby
Come on
All through the night
You're doing everything just right
You're doing all the things that I want you to
You give me no reason to ever be leavin'
You're doing all the things that I want you to
You're filling me with so much pleasure
A pleasure far beyond measure, now
What I feel is ecstasy
When you lay your body down here next to me
Oh, give it up, give it up, give it up
Come on, and give your love to me, yeah
Give it up, give it up, give it up
I need your love so desperately
It takes two, baby

Me and you, baby

It takes two, baby
To cool it down
Me and you, baby
C'mon, let's fool around
