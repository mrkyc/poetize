Hey...
Five minutes to midnight
And the mood is right
A lot of wine, a little music
Slow dancing by candlelight
Can't you feel it inside you
There's something going on
It's too strong to be questioned
And it feels too good to be wrong
Whenever we touch like this
Whenever I touch you lips
Baby, my heart beats faster by the minute
Whenever I kiss your face, oh, yeah
You know I want you right here
I want you right now
'Cause there's so much pleasure
In your embrace
Darlin' I
Baby, I could use a little love right now
Come on, come on
Darlin' I
Ooh, I could use a little love right now
Come on, come on

'Cause you know that it can be fun
Just put your head on my pillow
'Cause I wanna rub your back
Mmm, the way you get emotional
Girl, I know you like it like that, yeah
Whenever we touch like this
Whenever I touch you lips
Baby, my heart beats faster by the minute
Whenever I get like this, yeah
You know I want you right here
I want you right now
'Cause there's so much pleasure
In your embrace

Your complete surrender is all I want
So let's take it to the limit
Break all the rules
Go for broke, do what we choose

Do it in the kitchen, do it in the sink
