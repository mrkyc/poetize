Ooh, have you ever?
Oh-ho, have you ever loved, loved, loved, loved, loved?

You keep running, running away
I know you can't run forever
You think you're heading for a heartbreak again
Just as you did before

I can teach you how to love again
If you just trust in me
I can show you things you never seen
You don't know how much you're missing

Have you ever loved somebody?
Can you learn to love somebody
The way somebody loves you?
Have you ever known that feeling
Ooh, that special feeling
When somebody loves you?

You build a fortress around yourself
Your emotions they hide within
You've got your heart securely locked away
And you won't let nobody in
You might also like
Oh, I can show you how to love again (Love again)
If you just trust in me
I can show you things you never ever seen
You don't know how much you're missing

Have you ever loved somebody? (Somebody)
Can you learn to love somebody (Ooh girl)
The way somebody loves you? (Can you tell me please)
Have you ever known that feeling (Ooh)
Ooh, that special feeling (Don't it feel good)
When somebody loves you? (Oh, oh, oh)

When you think that it's safe, girl
Just take a look around
I will be there behind you
There's nothing to fear, no
'Cause I can never hurt you
I think the world about you
Can you learn to love me, too?
Can you learn to love me, too?

Mmm, I can teach you how to love again (Love again)
If you just trust in me
I can show you things you never ever seen
You don't know how much you're missing
Have you ever loved somebody? (Ooh baby)
Can you learn to love somebody (Can you tell me)
The way somebody loves you? (Can you tell me please)
Have you ever known that feeling (Ooh)
Ooh, that special feeling (Come on, tell me)
When somebody loves you? (Whisper sweetly in my ear)
Have you ever loved somebody? (Have you ever, ever)
Can you learn to love somebody
The way somebody loves you? (Won't you tell me, tell me, baby)
Have you ever known that feeling (Tell me)
Ooh, that special feeling
When somebody loves you?

Ooh, girl, I wanna teach you, yeah, oh, yeah
Let me show you, show you how to love
Oh, oh, yes I do
I wanna teach you, to love you
