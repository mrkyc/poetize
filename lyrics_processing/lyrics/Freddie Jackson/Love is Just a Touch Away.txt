With a smile upon my face
Had a dream last night
That love was here to stay
To know you're not here with me
Is tearing me apart
Can't you feel the pain
That's down inside of my heart?
Got a feeling
Something here is bound to change
Love is just a touch away
Got a feeling
Something here is bound to change
Love is just a touch away
Something is happening
I think you ought to know
Each time you're near me
Passion starts to flow
And you give your love to me
(Give it baby)
You won't regret it
No, no, no, no, no, no
Just open up
And let me start my show, girl
