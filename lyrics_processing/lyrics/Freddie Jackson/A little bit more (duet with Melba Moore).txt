Erase what's on our minds
This may not come again
Gonna make this magic last
So let's not move too fast
You feel so good to me
I wanna hold you in my arms forever
Not let go of you, never
Feel me with your touch
'Cause I could never get too much
Just a little bit more
(I need)
Just a little bit more
(Don't turn your back on me, don't you fall asleep)
Just a little bit more
(Oh, oh)
Tonight, we'll move real slow
Tomorrow you will go
And I will dream of this
So let your feelings show
Let your passion overflow
Give me the love I miss
You might also likeI wanna hold you in my arms forever
Not let go of you, no, never
Feel me with your touch
Because I could never get enough
Just a little bit more
(I need)
Just a little bit more
(Let your passion overflow, I need some more)
Just a little bit more
(Oh yes, I do)
I wanna hold you in my arms forever
And not let go of you, no, never
Feel me with your touch
Because I could never, never get too much
Just a little bit more, baby
(I need)
Just a little bit more, baby
(Don't turn your back on me, don't you fall asleep)
Just a little bit more, baby
Just a little bit more, more
Just a little bit more, baby
Just a little bit more, baby
Just a little bit more
Just a little bit more
I need to give you more
Just got to give you more
I've got to give you more
Just got to give you some more
I need to give you more
I need to give you more
I've got to give you some more
Ooh, oh, give me more
