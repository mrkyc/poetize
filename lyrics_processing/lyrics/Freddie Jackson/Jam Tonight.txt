Tell me why you came here
Was it just to sit and stare?
Won't you come go with me
Take out some time?
If you'll give me a hand
I know that we could jam
Let's get on down right now
Let's get on down

Oh, now don't you wanna jam tonight?
Jam tonight?

There's a new dance in town
Now who could be sitting down?
You've got to move in time
The time must go on
Clap your hands, pat your feet
Now you have got the beat
It's not too hard to keep
Once you start to jam
