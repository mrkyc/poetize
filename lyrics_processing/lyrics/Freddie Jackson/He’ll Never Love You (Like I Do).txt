You've been seen in cozy places
But there's a calm before the storm
Like you, he's been seen with other faces
Folks say he changes with the night
To break her heart is second nature
Oh, girl, he'll never do you right
I'm warning you, your heart's in danger
But you can bet your love on me
And you won't be lonely
I'll be waiting patiently
'Cause I love you only
He can never love you like I do
No, he'll never ever love you
Baby, like I do
Ooh, he'll never ever need you, need you
Half as much as I do
(Like I do)
He could never want you
Baby, like I do
I know I can be oversensitive
Well, I wouldn't be
If you didn't mean so much to me
The grass always seems greener
Over on the other side, you see
You might also likeBut you can bet your love on me
Girl, you won't be lonely, no
I'm into you totally
You see, I love you only
He can never love you like I do
No, he'll never ever love you
Ooh, baby, like I do
Ooh, he'll never ever need you, need you
Half as much as I do
(Like I do)
Ooh, he'll never ever want you
(Never want you)
Baby, like I do
I see that fire in your eyes
And all this passion comes as no surprise
Here's hoping soon you'll recognize
But until then, let me emphasize
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
He'll never love you, like I do
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
No, oh...
Bet your love on me
(Bet your love on me)
And you won't be lonely, no
I'm into you totally, you see
(Totally)
'Cause I love you only
He can never love you like I do
No, he'll never ever love you
Like I do
He'll never, never, never, never love you
(Never, never)
Not like I do
I care for you, girl
He'll never love you
(Never, never)
Never, I care for you now
