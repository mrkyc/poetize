Beer don't keep, love's not cheap
And trucks don't wreck themselves
Mama ain't a shrink, daddy ain't a bank
And God ain't a wishin' well
Money ain't rich, everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight
And sometimes wrong is right

Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's somethin' to some of it

Girls like to laugh, tears don't last
And scared's what praying's for
If it's close, swing the bat, everybody's got a past
And love's worth livin' for
When you dance, hold her close, 'til it breaks, go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No, you don't get to do some things again

Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's somethin' to some of it


When you can take it slow, 'cause time sure won't
What really makes you a man
Is bein' true to her
'Til your glass runs out of sand

Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's somethin' to some of it
