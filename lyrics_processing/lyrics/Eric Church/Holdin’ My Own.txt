Always been a fighter, scrapper, and a clawer
Used up some luck in lawyers
Like Huck from Tom Sawyer jumped on my raft
And shoved off chasing my dreams
Reeling in big fishes
I had some hits, and a few big misses
I gave 'em hell and got a few stitches
And these days, I show off my scars

With one arm around my baby
And one arm around my boys
A heart that's still pretty crazy
And a head that hates the noise
If the world comes knocking
Tell 'em I'm not home
I'm finally holdin' my own

I've burned up the fast lane
Dodging drugs and divorce
If I'm proof of anything
God sure loves Troubadours
Sometimes, late at night
I miss the smoke and neon
Sneak out of bed, grab a six-string
Play what's still turnin' me on
Like that tight old-time rock and roll
Or that right-down-home country gold
I miss blues and soul
But not more than I miss being home

With one arm around my baby
And one arm around my boys
A heart that's still pretty crazy
And a head that got sick of noise
If the world comes knocking, wondering where I've gone
Tell 'em I'm not home
I'm finally holdin' my own

'Til I run out of time
I'm gonna spend the rest of mine

With one arm around my baby
And one arm around my boys
A heart that's still pretty crazy
And a head that just got sick of noise
If the world comes knocking
Tell 'em I'm not home
I'm finally holdin' my own

And when my time on Earth is done
I want they write it on my stone
I lived, loved, and died holdin' my own
