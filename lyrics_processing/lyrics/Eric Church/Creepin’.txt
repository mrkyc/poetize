Bom, bom, bom, bom-oh
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom-oh

Like a honeybee beating on my screen door
I got a little buzz and my head is sore
And from my bed I can feel the sun
Lord I hear the morning come

Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping

You shot outta hell like a bullet from a gun
A flip of a switch
A thief on the run
And since the day you left me baby
I can feel the lonely
I can hear the crazy

Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping
See Eric Church LiveGet tickets as low as $250You might also like
Head for the future
Run from the past
Hide from the mirror
And live in a glass
What dreams forget the whiskey remembers
Kinda like molasses in late December

Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping

 Your cocaine kiss and caffeine love
 Your caffeine kiss and nicotine love
Got under my skin and into my blood
That need you back comes over me
Like ivy crawling up a hickory tree

Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping

Head to the future
Run from the past
Hide from the mirror
And live in a glass
What dreams forget the whiskey remembers
Kinda like molasses in late December
Just a creeping
Creeping, creeping, creeping

Break it down, down, down, down
Just last night I saw the light
At the end of that tunnel on the other side
Thought I found my way outta this pain
Only to find your memory train
Creeping, creeping, creeping, creeping

Bom, bom, bom, bom-oh
