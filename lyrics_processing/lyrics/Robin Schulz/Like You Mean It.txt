Sometimes I don't know if you're playing pretend
Where do we start, and where do we end?
Your fingertips, just joining with grace
Show me the truth, tell me to my face

Say you love me
Say you need me
Like you mean it, like you mean it
Say you love me
That you won't leave me
'Cause I don't believe it, I don't believe it

Kill my superstition
Please, I'm begging
Let the words roll of your tongue, I'm waiting
Say you love me
Say you need me
Like you mean it, like you mean it

Yeah, I don't know what I'm doing this for
'Cause we're not the type to be insecure
I just never knew it could be this good
I'm acting crazy, not like I should
