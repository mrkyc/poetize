Your eyes are dim
I need the real love
Won't make you drip
In two, alone in the, oh
And what got me high has left me so low, so low
You gave your space
And in your loving
I drink the song
I drink the world in
And what got me high has left me so low, so low

You can't kill the fire while it's burning (Kill the fire while it's burning)
You can't kill the light in the dark (Kill the light in the dark)
You can't kill the fire while it's burning (Kill the fire while it's burning)
You can't kill the light in the dark, in the dark

In the dark
You can't kill the light in the dark, in the dark

As you fade out
Our sunsets dying
So tell me who
And what you're fighting
What got me high has left me so low, so low
Those sleepless nights
 child
You lock me out in your denial
What got me high has left me so low, so low
