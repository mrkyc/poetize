This is all we got
Dreaming 'bout a revolution in our minds
Talking 'bout our resolutions getting high
We don't need a lot
And we don't care if we fuck it up
If it's what we got
Then why not give it all we got?


Lock me out of this life institution
I am angry and high on illusions
Yes, I hate, but hate's not a solution
Trying my best, but hey, I'm just a human, oh

We don't need to say we're sorry
We don't need to worship heaven's art
We don't need to say we're sorry
So where's the love?

This is all we got
Dreaming 'bout a revolution in our minds
This is all we got
Talking 'bout our resolutions getting high
We don't need a lot
And we don't care if we fuck it up
If it's what we got
Then why not give it all we got?
