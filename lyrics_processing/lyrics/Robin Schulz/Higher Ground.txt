You were life, you were love
You were water
You were bread
Feel my breath getting harder
And I know if you're gone any longer
That I could bleed my heart out
You were gold and I took you for granted
Held the world in the palm of my hand
But I was blind, couldn't see what I had then
Now I bleed my heart out

If you could stay just a little while longer
You might believe, I've been trying to make a change

'Cause everything I touch, turns to ashes
And everything I love, walks away from me
Everything I've lost, casts a shadow
I'm trying not to hold on
I'm ready for that, higher, higher ground
Higher, higher ground
Higher, higher ground
I'm never coming down, never coming down

We were young, we were lost
We were frozen
Broken hearts that were aching to open
Now I see there was no way of knowing
That we were bleeding out

But if you could stay just a little while longer
You might believe, I've been trying to make a change

'Cause everything I touch, turns to ashes
And everything I love, walks away from me
Everything I've lost, casts a shadow
I'm trying not to hold on
I'm ready for that, higher, higher ground
Higher, higher ground
Higher, higher ground
I'm never coming down, never coming down
I'm never coming down, never coming down
I'm never coming down, never coming down

'Cause everything I touch, turns to ashes
And everything I love, walks away from me
Everything I've lost, casts a shadow
I'm trying
'Cause everything I touch, turns to ashes
And everything I love, walks away from me
Everything I've lost, casts a shadow
I'm trying not to hold on
I'm ready for that, higher, higher ground
Higher, higher ground
Higher, higher ground
Never coming down
Higher, higher ground
Higher, higher ground
Higher, higher ground
