This is all we got
Dreaming 'bout a revolution in our minds
This is all we got

Lock me out of this life institution
I am angry and high on illusions
Yes, I hate, but hate's not a solution
Trying my best, but hey, I'm just a human, oh

We don't need to say we're sorry
We don't need to worship heaven's art
We don't need to say we're sorry
So where's the love?

This is all we got
Dreaming 'bout a revolution in our minds
This is all we got
Talking 'bout our resolutions getting high
We don't need a lot
And we don't care if we fuck it up
If it's what we got
Then why not give it all we got?

I can see in your eyes you're defeated
Try to fool yourself till you believe it
That you're better off numb and not feeling
But there's a sky if you jump through the ceiling, oh

We don't need to say we're sorry
We don't need to worship heaven's art
We don't need to say we're sorry
So where's the love?

This is all we got
Dreaming 'bout a revolution in our minds
This is all we got
Talking 'bout our resolutions getting high
We don't need a lot
And we don't care if we fuck it up
If it's what we got
Then why not give it all we got? (We got)
Then why not give it all we got? (We got)

Lock me out of this life institution, no
Trying my best, but hey, I'm just a human, oh
We don't need to say we're sorry
We don't need to say we're sorry
So where's the love?
This is all we got
Dreaming 'bout a revolution in our minds
This is all we got
Oh-oh-oh-oh
This is all we got
Dreaming 'bout a revolution in our minds
This is all we got
Talking 'bout our resolutions getting high
We don't need a lot
And we don't care if we fuck it up
If it's what we got
Then why not give it all we got? (We got)
