Jupiter on my fingertips
Kiss the sky with crimson lips
I want to fly high with you
Wrote a book with my burning wrist
Ignite like a rocket ship
I wanna hide away from you

I've failed in love, I've been in pain
Head floating up, I feel insane
And suddenly we've known the taste
Throw me into the flames, a kiss on my bod'
And nothing ever feels the same
You're the one that I blame for draining my blood

Bring me up, up, take me down
Give me love, love, love me loud
You bring me up, up to take me down
Just give me love, love, love me loud
Love me loud (Hm-uh-ooh, hm-uh-ooh)
Lift me up, up, take me down
Give me love, love, love me loud
You bring me up, up to take me down
Just give me love, love, love me loud
Love me loud (Hm-uh-ooh, hm-uh-ooh)

Bittersweet sure taste divine
Float away on your valentine
I am the sailor, you're the sea
Swallowed up by frozen wave
Metal heart wraps me in chains
I'm tangled up, so come to play

I've failed in love, I've been in pain (Yeah, I've been, I've been in pain, yeah)
Head floating up, I feel insane (Hmm I feel insane)
And suddenly we've known the taste
Throw me into the flames, a kiss on my bod'
And nothing ever feels the same
You're the one that I blame for chaining my blood

Bring me up, up, take me down
Give me love, love, love me loud
You bring me up, up to take me down
Just give me love, love, love me loud
Bring me up, up, take me down
Give me love, love, love me loud
You bring me up, up to take me down
Just give me love, love, love me loud
Love me loud--
