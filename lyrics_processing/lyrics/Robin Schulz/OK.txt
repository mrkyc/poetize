I really need you
I really need your love right now
I'm fading fast
Not gonna last
I'm really stupid
I'm burning up, I'm going down
I'm in it bad
Don't even ask

When I found myself in the middle, in the middle, in the middle
Could you love me more, just a little, just a little?
Overcomplicate when it's simple, when it's simple, when it's simple
Would you love me more, just a little?

So tell me now
When every star falls from the sky
And every last heart in the world breaks
Oh hold me now
When every ship is going down
I don't fear nothing when I hear you say

It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay

I'm really sorry
Sorry I dragged you into this
I overthink, that's all it is
The way you love me
The way you love me 'til the end
The way you love me
Oh yeah, it makes me king again

When I found myself in the middle, in the middle, in the middle
Could you love me more, just a little, just a little?
Overcomplicate when it's simple, when it's simple, when it's simple
Would you love me more, just a little?

So tell me now
When every star falls from the sky
And every last heart in the world breaks
Oh hold me now
When every ship is going down
I don't fear nothing when I hear you say

It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay

When every star falls from the sky
And every last heart in the world breaks
It's gonna be okay
When every ship is going down
I don't fear nothing when I hear you say
