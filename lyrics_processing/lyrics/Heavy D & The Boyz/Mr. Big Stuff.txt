Oh yeah
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are? Oh yeah

I'm rough and tough and all that stuff
I make you dance and prance 'til you huff and puff
There's just no way you can get enough
Of me, your Mister Big Stuff
I'm the overweight-er, prince dominator MC
Heavy D, constant weight gainer
And since I choose the weight not to lose
I will stay this way so that I can bruise (Oh yeah)
MC's around who front and frown
You go round for round, I go pound for pound
At the end of the party when you're sayin' goodnight
Don't come to me and say, "Take it light"
I'm your Mister Big Stuff

Who do you think you are?
Oh yeah, Mister Big Stuff
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
You might also like
I'm a quick rhyme shooter, rap rookie recruiter
I always say could, never ever say coulda
I'm healthy and stacked, not a beast or all fat
I get applause and awards every time I rap (Oh yeah)
I love the way I am, I would never switch
I'm the greatest entertainer since a porno flick
You move and groove to my funky tune
Party people, it's time to make a room for your Mister Big Stuff

Who do you think you are?
Oh yeah, Mister Big Stuff
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

Rock it, Big Stuff, the record, me, the mastermind
A top dollar money better, go get a, designer
A fly girl lover and a woman pleaser
Girls come to me, say (Heavy, let me squeeze ya)
An incredible, overweight huggable
Prince, a bold treat, that's why I'm so lovable
I got the knack to keep the fly girls shovin'
Two hundred and sixty pounds of good lovin' (Ooh)
They all want me, MC Hev D
The more of the beef the more there is to squeeze
Got the juice to get loose, make you all get up
You want a swing, give me a ring, Heavy D, your Mister Big Stuff
Who do you think you are?
Oh yeah, Mister Big Stuff
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

Eddie F, break down
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh yeah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Now I'm the swing beat artist with skills to kill
Money earnin' Mt. Vernon's where I live and chill
When I walk the streets, I get much respect
Get hellos and what-nots from the young'uns and the vets
'Cause I never been beaten, rhymes are pre-sweetened
Duck, punk panty emcees start retreatin'
'Cause on Heavy D, you shouldn't be sleepin'
Takin' dirty emcees away, I'm sweepin'
Got a tower, of power, MC's I devour
Every second of the hour, I send 'em to the shower
I'm cool, not a fool, from the new school
Drinkin' brew by my pool, sittin' on my gold stool
Gotta rock, that I drop, like a horse, on the trot
When it comes to makin' money, it takes what I got
I know you're sayin' to yourself you can't get enough
But I'll be back, to attack, Heavy D, your Mister Big Stuff
Who do you think you are?
Oh yeah, Mister Big Stuff
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

Oh yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
