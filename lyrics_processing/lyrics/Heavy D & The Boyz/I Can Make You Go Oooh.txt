Ooooh! Keep it movin
Aaaaah!
Ooooh! Keep it movin
Aaaaah!
(Damn, I can hardly hear myself)

In the bedroom at night, aight, candle lights flicker
Flicker, dim, the water gets swimmed
Body gets touched, licked from head to toe
Here we go, here we go, keeping it slow-mo
Ooh, ahh, the title, the subject
The closer I get, the more your body sweats
Something's getting bigger, could it be my trigger
Bet you didn't figure on a pro cause I can make you go:

Ooooh! Keep it movin
Aaaaah! I can make you go
Ooooh! Keep it movin
Aaaaah! Love you, love you
Love you down the proper way

"Romeo, Romeo?!", Knock it off, sweetie
Here comes a brother with more energy than Wheaties
Not to mention stamina, then I got to handle ya
A Love Boat backstroke while I'm steady slamming ya
Love foreign kisses, French if you wishes
Everything is copasetic, no need to be suspicious
My father's last son, I hope you had fun
Now go on and run and tell your friends you got done
By the Over rhymer, love a pretty mama
When I start I don't stop so it's best that you keep calmer
(Keep it moving)
Honey drops dribble, as I begin to nibble you
In spots and places that'll make your body quibble
Take it easy, take it easy, you're cool when you squeeze me
Don't ever tease me, just please me while you ease me
But let's keep the flow, before I let you stroll
There's one thing you should know, I can make you go..
You might also like
(Keep it moving)

Mmmm! Goody-goody, yum-yum, honey
Smooth as silk, thick as milk, rich as honey
Won't you come and see me, with your tight bikini
I know a dozen cousins that would just love to be me
So come on and lay, lay with the Lover
We could tuck sheets, snuggle up under the cover
So unplug the phone, nobody's home
Here we're all alone and I love to hear you moan
We can do it everywhere, from downstairs to upstairs
In the bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, on a chair
That's how I'm living: freaky, freaky
Oww, baby, do me, do me!
Turn me on, turn me on, from dusk til dawn
We can go on and on, and on and on
You should already know, but in case you don't know
The Lover's in the house, and I can make you go:

Ooooh! Keep it movin
Aaaaah! I can make you go
Ooooh! Keep it movin
Aaaaah! I can make you go
Ooooh! Keep it movin
Aaaaah! Love you, love you
Love you down the proper way
Candle lights on a dim set
Dripping with sweat, watch the Lover catch wreck
All of a sudden (DROP) a taste of honey
Watch it roll from your lips straight down to your tummy
After that we relax and it's time for a backrub
Champagne bubbles in a marble bathtub
You'll never flow the way you used to flow
There's one thing you should know, I could make you go:

Ooooh! Keep it movin
Aaaaah! I can make you go
Ooooh! Keep it movin
Aaaaah! I can make you go
Ooooh! Keep it movin
Aaaaah! I can make you go
Ooooh! Keep it movin
Aaaaah! I can make you go
Ooooh! Keep it movin
Aaaaah! Love you, love you
