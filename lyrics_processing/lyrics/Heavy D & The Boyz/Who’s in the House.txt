Rip tip tip top, ting-a-ling-a-ling-lop
When I'm at home, my phone ring-a-ling-a-lings a lot
There's only one way to knock a boot, and I'm a boot knocker
Not Orville Redenbacher, but I'm a punani popper
Slick like oil, wrap like aluminum foil
When I'm hot, I'm hot, so watch me boil
Easy on the tiptoe, slow flow, peace to D.O.C. yo
H-O, here I go, go
Here comes the Heavster (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tell me if you like it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can rock a party and bounce a party
Rock a party, bounce a party, rock a party, bounce a party
Captain  back on a fat track
Mack here to pack and I'm a light-skinned, black
You know what I'm about, I'm out, so find a new route
'Cause I got the answer to the question: Who's in the house?

I never run, I never ran, cause I'm not the running man
I can do more than one, so call me two-can Sam
I'm smooth, so call me Mr. Parkay
I parlay, around the way, ev-ery day, hey!
Some flip scripts, but I flip books
For good looks, a crazy hook, and that's all it took, UH!
I'm the Boogie Woogie Man, the boogie bugle boy
Ain't nothin fuddy duddy, nutty like an Almond Joy
Lightskinned, black, my high top's flat
Mack on the map, knock knock, who is that?
It's the one you love, the one you feel the need for
Slow down, clown, the one to watch your speed for
Ready or not, not ready enough, to be
You're petty, not steady, not ready enough for Heavy D
You know what I'm about, I'm out, so find a new route

Check it

Come and get a little bit, a tidbit, a tasket
A tisket, before you ask it, don't even risk it
Frisk it, before you're feelin' it, know who you're dealin' with
To get to the point, cover your joint, make sure you're concealin' it
I love a pretty tongue, natural suntan sandal
Hair tangle, easy to handle
Kind of girl who's single, ready to mingle
Flavorful like a Pringle, never used to jingle
Here comes the Heavster (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tell me if you like it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can rock a party and bounce a party
Rock a party, bounce a party, rock a party, bounce a party
Don't need a hippy dippie, hide a hickie stripper mickie
Tricky flippy, sticky icky, out for a quickie, quickie
You know what I'm about, I'm out, so find a new route
