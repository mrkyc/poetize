Yo, now I can take my time, but I'm speedy if it's needy
She says she want it all, so I gave to the greedy
Love is satisfyin', if it's tasty than I'm tryin' 'em
Never brought 'em, never buy 'em
On occasion I 
Enough of what you heard, Heavy D has got the wig out
In between the levy of a Peggy I might pig out
Nope I ain't the joke, I got the stroke to make you bug out
Girls get very happy when I tap the nappy dugout
Easy on the easy does it, who is it or who was it
Rough when it comes to lovin' it rubbin' it while you're huggin' it
Wicked in bed, wicked in bed, that's what I said
When I came the  fled, there mi haffi kill it dead
Mackin' and stackin' I'm a freak between the sheets
Never lacked in the back, stay harder than concrete
Far from Chubby Checker, not a half steppa double decker
Wreck her, never sweat her, but I'll get her,

Ayo, my technique kicks like a kung fu flip
On the one-two tip I catch wreck when I rip
The overweight lover, slick like butter
Never did stutter, swingin' in the gutter
Sometimes I wear my hat on the back when I rap
I never felt ashamed, 'cause I'm proud to be black
You see me on a poster, poppin' like a toaster
I know about the devil, but me and God's closer
Hip to the hopper, proper like my poppa
This girl said she's comin', I tried but I couldn't stop her
I'm on the quickie not the hickie tip, wuick to flip and flop a script
Before you get to poppin', know who you're dealin' with
Known to do a Susie with a doosie of a stroke
I never pulled my Uzi on a floozie leavin' slow (Say what)
I spark it like a match, like a hook I always catch
You know where I'ma be at, here the rap, check the set

I like it with a twist in the midst of danger
I wreck a roonie, not a phony or a stranger
Not a punani pretender, quick to bend your fender
Pure beef, well done, so love me tender
Or you could do it on the flip side, honey dip side
Outside, inside, tales from the dark side
Eeny-meeny-miney-mo, let me go, here I am
What's the plan, hot damn, who's the man?
Yes I am, perfect 'cause I practice, I mean I'm always at this
Girls flaunt when they want me to smack this
SCUBA-dip diver, clever like MacGyver
Not a nine-to-fiver, street life survivor
A honeysuckle hunter, kick lyrics like a punter
First I'll have the back of, and then I'll have the front of
Never 'fessed when it came to sex
Wrecked when it came to sex, wrecked when it came to sex
