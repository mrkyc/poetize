You told me (You told me)
You loved me (And you loved me)
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love
You told me (And you told me)
You loved me (And you loved me)
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

You, you told me that you loved
But it wasn't never really me you dug, or digged
You said I was ya nig'
And come to figure out that you was all about you
And every single step you take, you took for you
When I first met ya, you were looking rough
In ya Timbaland boots, cut up shorts and Egyptian musk
Smelling like an African queen
Could this be my dream? But everything ain't really what it seems
A couple of months went by, and you and I was thick
Then you started changing, and scripts began to flip
Things that you said you had to do on Sunday
Was now moved to Monday, where were you on Wednesday
You had to take advantage cause I was nice
If you bought me something once, I had to buy you something twice
You told me that your friends sat you down and said you really oughta leave me
Believe me, truthful
You might also like
You told me (And you told me)
You loved me (And you loved me)
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love
You told me (And you told me)
You loved me (And you loved me)
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

Yo
Too much of a party animal, I couldn't handle you
Always being out, once in a while was understandable
Where did I go? Where did I go wrong?
Was it my fault or your fault?
Sit down and thought about it over a malt
Came to the conclusion, that you were confusing
Cause all along, I thought it was wrong, I thought it was me
Started bugging out, stopped hanging out, feeling doubt
Wasn't looking out, but now I'm Swayze
I gave you props, you were smart and intelligent
And if things went wrong, you stood strong and rebelled against
And how you changed me, had me reading books that amazed me
And just to say hello, you would page me
Had a real pretty smile, like an innocent child
Most of the time calm, every now and then buck wild
Treated you good, thought I should
Always thinking of ya
You were fly and I loved ya
Truthful
You told me (And you told me)
You loved me (And you loved me)
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love
You told me (And you told me)
You loved me (And you loved me)
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love
You told me (And you told me)
You loved me (And you loved me)
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

You said you'd be around
Yeah, yeah

Yo
Sad to say goodbye, but I got to cause it's over now
Why, because you did me wrong too long, plus you broke your vow
Never meant to, but you said your time was definitely wasted
But I'm truly grateful for the flavor that I tasted
See ya, hate to be ya, but I wish that I was with ya
Now I'll be on my way, and no, I definitely won't forget ya
I don't know where you are, wherever you're at this one's for you
Remembering all the swings and different things we used to do
Truthful
You told me (And you told me)
You loved me (And you loved me)
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love
You told me (And you told me)
You loved me (And you loved me)
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love
You told me (And you told me)
You loved me (And you loved me)
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love
You told me (And you told me)
You loved me (And you loved me)
You told me
