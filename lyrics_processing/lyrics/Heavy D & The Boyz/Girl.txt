And there's a lot of smart brothers out there and sisters, especially
Like when you look at, the, the, the
When you look at a black woman... man
When you look at a black man and this is from my heart
I believe
I believe first and foremost that the black woman is responsible for the black man
When I say responsible, I mean without, we, we, we're lost
Ya know, whether it's your mother
Whether it's your wife
Whether it's your sister
Any good black man, has a black woman that they can count on
And they don't have anybody else say anything different

Now love is lovely
Love is the best thing that God could ever provide
