Let it rain! I don't wanna go outside
Let it rain! I just wanna be with you
Let it rain! I don't feel like takin' a ride
Let it rain! You know what I wanna do
Let it rain! Girl, you're makin' me sweat
Let it rain! Come close, let's see how far we can get
And I'll ease your pain, so let it rain, let it rain, let it rain

Let it rain, honey, pop the umbrella
The heavster goes down smooth as Amaretto
Fingers keep twiddlin' but I'll keep drizzlin'
Play like a fiddle and here to move a million
Plus, cause when I'm damp I don't rust
Girls make a fuss for the lover they lust
Nature taking it's course, so precise
Proving Heavy D can strike ya more than twice
Pronto, snuggle, better yet cuddle
Happy like a little kid playin' in a puddle
Of H2O, a drip-drop intro
So figure I'm somewhere making a rainbow
Shine, with an intent to broaden
The quiet storm that lurks more often
So lay with the lover, snuggle up under the cover
And I'll ease your pain, so let it rain, let it rain
You might also like(CHORUS)

Now we can go downstairs, strike a match to the log
Let the firepace burn, dim the lights till it's dark
Don't worry, honey, I'll take good care of ya
I know what I'm doing, I get wrecked on a regular
Red light, green light, one, two, three
(C.L. Smooth: Hey, yo, who's on the mic?)
Well, it's me, Heavy D
And I've become somewhat of a national figure
You see, some are big but the Heavster is bigger
And I like candy bars with nuts
And ippy-dippy girls with bodacious butts
So lay with the lover, snuggle up under the cover
And I'll ease your pain
So let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
(CHORUS)

Okey Dokey, lookin' for a trophy
Gigolo, Romeo, wrong category
More the Don Juan type
Smooth like a preacher, your high school teacher
Just call me your daddy-o, lounging on the patio
Park it like a pimp, I drive a Jeep not a Caddy though
Pardon me, miss, in your high heel steps
Come inside the crib set before you get wet
Now just for prop, let's keep this official
'Heavy' is the name, 'D' is the initial
I love the way you strut in that suit from France
There's a party tonight, would you like to dance
You're rollin with the Lover so be sure you dress clever
I'll pick you up at eight in my droptop whatever
All of a sudden I got the tingle for a Twinkie
Fever-flavor for a Pringle, I think I'd like to mingle
With somebody thick, someone that I can cling to
A milk chocolate beauty, someone that I can sing to
You got the makings of a rainy day girl to me
So come a little closer, let's see how it'd be
(CHORUS)

Lightning and thunder kinda makes you wonder
Not too bad for a brother who's the son
Of a father who's a tech and a mother who's a nurse
And I get paid cause I learned to kick a verse
I'm on a roll, I got 'nough control
Who needs a Grammy when you know you got soul
I'm a smooth yella, complexion: vanilla
High-low afro, intelligent feller
You look worried, does something trouble ya?
We can take a ride in my Heavy D.M.W
But let's wait till the rain stops
So you can gimme what you want and show me what you got
But for now just snuggle me, snuggle me
Quit the chit-chat, double up and start loving me
You got the makings of a rainy day girl to me
