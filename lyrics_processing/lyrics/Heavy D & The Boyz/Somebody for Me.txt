Oh yeah

I want somebody

Aight

I want somebody to love me for me
Happy happy is the way that I wanna be (2X)

Bust it
Now I've searched low, and I've searched high
Trying to find myself a cutie pie
But destination leads me to a dead end
Over and over and over again
They told me to wait, so I waited
Anticipated, debated and delayed it
But still came up with the same ol' thing
Nothing
It seems as if every time I find the right girl
She turns out to be the very wrong girl
Tell me y'all, when will this madness stop?
I want somebody to love me for me
Not because I'm MC Heavy D
I'm looking for a love that's as solid as a rock
You might also like
I want somebody to love me for me
Happy happy is the way that I wanna be (2X)

Now maybe I'll take a trip around the world
And find myself a beautiful, gorgeous girl
They say when you look, one never finds
They also say that love is blind
It ain't that blind that I can't see
Somebody out there who's perfect for me
Somebody who's gonna love me for me

I know you want love

Love, that's what I'm talking about
A relationship, a commitment
Something to live for

Maybe if you take, your time

Time has been taken and time has been spent
Now it's time for the lover to score
I want somebody to love me for me
Happy happy is the way that I wanna be (4X)

So that's the storyline of my life
No cutie pie, no future wife
Just relationships that bounce back like rubber
(Yo, word to the mutha!)
I guess I'll call it a day and throw my towel in
Cause it seems that I can't win
So I'll just carry on being an overweight lover
(Word...to...mutha!)

I want somebody to love me for me
