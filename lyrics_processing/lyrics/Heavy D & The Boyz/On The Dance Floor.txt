AIY! On the dance floor (2x)
AIY! On the, dance floor now hit me!
AIY! (4x)

Get up and cup your feet, the beat has just been played
I know you like what you're hearin' cause you look amazed
The reason for the matter that you're standin' there gazin'
The record is for you and Heavy D is, amazing
Truthfully speaking, I am treating
You to a sound you're glad to 
Combined with the funk full power of beat
Originated situated, by MC Heavy D, yah


Motivation is the thought that we put behind
This musical scratch, combined with rhyme
So that you can enjoy, and employ
Yo' feet to the beat of a man, not a boy
Adjust yourself, get a musical grip
Exciting lyric writing, I know it can hit
It's too hard to resist, a beat like this
Don't fight it, just like it, cause you can't miss
From the tune I assume, that you will soon
Be filled with the skill, that's around the room
Cause I am presenting, my rapping skill
So you can dance to my beat, and dance you will

An introduction is deserved to show you where we stand
Heavy D & the Boyz, the dance floor band
The crew with the juice, rock and we produce
No stoppin' when we're droppin' when we start to get loose
Outrageous and famous, cash obtainers
Schooler of the beat and tough guy tamer
Speech comin' from the overweighter dominator
Rough and tough I'll sink a perpetrator
With my crew by my side, G-Wiz and T-Roy
In the booth is Eddie F., they unite the boyz
I'm hurtin' and I'm workin', non-believers dispersin'
The overweight lover, and I will cold hurt
And if any folks negative toward me
Not despisin' but I'm risin' over duck emcees
Cause I will take 'em, make 'em, reshape 'em
Bring 'em to the crib, study hard then make 'em
Better than they were or ever, could be
Now they're a perfect product, by emcee Heavy D
Cause I got the truth and a whole lot more
Don't be sad that I was back on the, dance floor
Yah
