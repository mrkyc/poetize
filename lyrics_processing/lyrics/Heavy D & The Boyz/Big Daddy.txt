Oh, it's time again (It's definitely time again)
Check check check check (It's time)
Ugh funk, say what (say what) (Waterbed Hev, waterbed)
It's a interlude y'all, just an interlude (It's just an interlude?)
Interlude y'all, yeah just an interlude?
It's a interlude y'all, just an interlude (Just a waterbed)
Ugh Double up yo, Uptown, official (you ain't know? ugh huh)
What the deal?
I wanna know is this love's for real
Or could it be lust that I feel
You got it going on and on like a wheel, fly sex appeal
Physique extra ill, smell sweet dress to kill
You got me open like ya token, hot and smokin'
Jacuzzi bubble bath, laughin' joking
Candle light talking about how you and your ex-man fight
Tropical sight, beach sand white, listen
Seafood dishes, wine cooler, champagne wishes, Waterbed Hev
Fine do with some riches
You're love-able, hug-able I love the cute mug on you
As long as I'm around and down nothin' could ever trouble you
Chorus:
I want your body, the way you touch me
Drivin' in your Caddie
You could be my Big Daddy
Take it slowly, Heavy hold me
Drivin' in your Caddie
You could be my Big Daddy
You might also likeYou're my mahogany dime, I spend quality time
Cute face, haircut like the Halle design
Keep my dear laced up with fly gear and makeup
But you should see her when she wake up, never could we break up
Shop till you drop cause the cream don't stop
Buy a bunch of outfits that's sexy and hot
So she could look good for Heavy D
Overweight loving MC, rub ya gently
You know its thee big CEO sex OT
Mack game similar next to Goldie, flex ya boldly
You might feel me creeping thru ya room late at night
It's Hev, my waterbed stead' so get it right
You be like damn, its that big man we all love to like
Game airtight, while you caught up in the hype
That's right, Hev Diggy, niggie be jiggy
Baby you ready for Big Daddy?
Chorus:
I want your body, the way you touch me
Drivin' in your Caddie
You could be my Big Daddy
Take it slowly, Heavy hold me
Drivin' in your Caddie
You could be my Big Daddy
You on my mind like all the time
You genuine and you fine vision you like dollar sign
Boo be all that and then some
Job all that, mad income
And New York is where she represent from
24-7 you the one that I be sweating
You a dime that's no question, couldn't be nothin' less than
Sexually the best next to me I confess
You got me hooked on like phonics or weed heads on Chronic
Now sip your Remi, you give me more like Demi, good and plenty
Nothin could compare to you, Boo I swear to you
I feel for you for real for you
All I wanna do is be with you
Might even steal for you
You walk like, you talk like you sexy
When you kiss me you bless me undress me caress me
You on my mind like all the time
You genuine and you fine vision you like dollar sign
Chorus: Repeat until fade
I want your body, the way you touch me
Drivin' in your Caddie
You could be my Big Daddy
Take it slowly, Heavy hold me
Drivin' in your Caddie
