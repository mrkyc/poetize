Here comes the big mack
Not the kind of Mac that you get from Mickey Ds
But the kind of mack that attract stacked ladies
Sex appeal I feel for the real deal
Squeal, get real chill, then sample the fish meal
Harm me, that army, they tried to bomb me, got cooked like salami
Mommy, mommy, mommy, I was wild, they couldn't calm me
I got wrecked and flexed from the intro
Pocket gets stretched and stacked from c-lo
Today ain't the day the wrong way to be rubbing me
Cause I'm on stage and twenty-thousand is loving me
There's another cutie with a 'GO HEAVY D!!' sign
Outside around the block, it's the Heavy D ticket line
I can get yours, you can get mine
No movie makers allowed cause everything's well and fine
Speed 'em up, I munch and crunch from a slow start
"Bum-diddley-diddley-D" is the Heavster's trademark
Far from a chump, now everybody make your body thump
Bump to a jump and make sure you hump
Cause everything is faaaabulous and full of pleasure
And all goes swell when you're swinging with the Heavster

Mmm! Milky, milky brother, here comes another hit-smash
Beats and lyrics, flip flopping enough cash
Pardon me, baby, lover lady, how you doing, sugar?
Oh, you only speak for cash? You dirty hooker
Now let me keep stepping, catching wreck and hit the set
The Overweight Lover is back and I'm sweating
I know what feels good, I hope it feels good
Now let me check my pocket and make sure jimmy has a hood
Everything's okeydokey, hunky-dory, just great
Ma, fix me a plate, I like rice with my steak
Make a little room, here comes the groom
Married to a tune, sweep like a broom
So pass around forty, get naughty if you wanna, shorty
I know you want to warm me, just call me push a ?????
Cuz life is a fabulous and full of pleasure
And all goes swell, when you're swinging with the Heavster

Break it down
Yeah, here we go, come on, come on
Alright, swing it, swing it, swing it
One, two, three, bring it back!

One potato, two potato, three potato, four
Listen to the raw, the crowd wants more
I don't need a buzz to get a bubble at a party
I'll drink a pop and pass on the Bacardi
Pardon me, cutie, with your booty that shakes
Your body's rather milky like the milk on my cornflakes
I'd really like to know ya if you wanna know me
Here's my SkyPage number, beep me, it's free
We can talk all night, laugh and share a few jokes
Later on after that, BOOTS GET SMOKED
The cappable, rap-able, handclap-able, tap-able
The incredible, rub-able, rub-able, hug-able, snuggable
Me, 'D' without the double-e, suckers never trouble me
When I do a stunt in a flick they never double me
Girlies, they be loving me, my belly, they be rubbing me
Step inside the set for a sec, they dig-dugging me
Eeeny-meenie-miney-moe, pump up your stereo
Listen to the Overweight Lover flow
In your district, tricky like a convict
A hit will whip from my lip on a slick tip
I never got high cause I don't recall being low
Think about it and let the Heavster go, peace
