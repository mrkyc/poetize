Ha-ha, check it out

I got a funny feeling, honey, that you're kind of digging me
But every time you see me, word is born, you be ignoring me
I know your name, yes, I do, because your girls told me
I know where you live, you want to bet, because your girls showed me
But I'll parlay and stay out of your way
Figuring I won't be ignorant and catch you the next day
When I'm in focus, I notice you only move with a chosen few
Irreplaceable, what's up with insatiable you
I never figured you for the quiet type
On the down low, the low pro-file type
I always thought you was a rah-rah mama
Stirring up crazy confusion, causing drama
What's the matter, huh? Cat got your tongue
Or some mack got you strung, or maybe I ain't the one
I want to know cause if I don't, it's going to haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me thinking you want me

Girl, unfix me, the way you do
You really got it going on
All night long
Girl, unfix me, the way you do
You really got it going on (Got it going on)
All night long
Girl, unfix me, the way you do
You really got it going on
All night long

I'm steady picking my brain, trying to figure your game
What's your angle, tell me where you're coming from
The whole picture is strange, so I'm digging the frame
Because I like what I see and I want some
So tell me what's the plot, what's the plan?
You're looking for a brother to get got? I'm not your man
But believe in me, you want to be with me
But you won't even talk to me to tell me what it is you see in me
I gotta hear it from your girls, Uptown
But word got around from my crew in Brooklyn and in the Boogie Down
Said you had a thing for me
And what would it take for a date, and wait, uh, swing with me
I got your cards, you're playing hard to get
I'm long and I'm strong, and if it's on, I keep it soft and wet
Let me know cause if you don't, it's going to haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me, thinking you want me
Freaks me
You really got it going on (Got it goin' on)
You've got me waiting

Girl, unfix me, the way you do
You really got it going on
All night long (You've got me waiting)
Girl, unfix me, the way you do
You really got it going on
All night long

I never stumble cause I'm humble and I'm ready to rap
You got me feeling like I'm sleeping, and it's keeping me trapped
But still in all, you want to stroll and have a fella on layaway
Fronting for nothing like it's something for me to stay away
Emotional trips, get a grip because I'm losing it
Ideas were clear, had it in gear, now you're confusing it
I had the thought that you were caught and you were going steady
Wasn't checking for Heavy 'cause you had a friend already
But I'ma put it all aside, cause God is my guide
Swallow my pride, stride, and follow my guide
Let me know cause if you don't, it's going to haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me thinking you want me
Girl, unfix me, the way you do
(Ooh, baby, make me feel so good)
You really got it going on
All night long
Girl, unfix me, the way you do
You really got it going on (Girl, you got it going)
All night long
Girl, unfix me, the way you do
(Freak me, yeah)
You really got it going on
All night long
Girl, unfix me, the way you do
You really got it going on
All night long
Girl, unfix me, the way you do
(Anticipating)
You really got it going on (Gotta have your love)
All night long
You've got me waiting
Girl, unfix me, the way you do
You really got it going on
All night long
You've got me waiting
Girl, unfix me, the way you do
You really got it going on (Girl, you got it going on)
All night long
You've got me waiting
Girl, unfix me, the way you do
You really got it going on
All night long
You've got me waiting
