Ohh, baby! Do me, do me!
Ohh, baby! Do me, do me!
Ohh, baby! Do me, do me!
I love the way you dance!

Give me a thick, body milkshake
Dapper dawn, Capricorn thin heartbreak girl
With a natural curl, no jheri necessary
All I need is someone who will make me merry
And delightful, comfortable, my belly is rub-able
Stick with the Over cause the Over is huggable
I know I like you and you know you like me
So, do me, baby, do me!

Ohh, baby! Do me, do me!
Ohh, baby! Do me, do me!
Ohh, baby! Do me, do me!
I love the way you dance!

I like ice cream and bacon, cookies and milk and
Patent leather boots and girls in silk and
Downtown cuties with nice firm booties
I must push up cause I'm a lover, it's my duty
Give me some room, yes, that is necessary
Pass me the soda, my favorite flavor: cherry
Give me a piece of that you-know-what
So, we can get up on the dance floor and shake that stuff
Ring-around-the-rosy, pocket-full-of-posies
(Say, man, whatcha doin'?) I think you're being nosy
Do me a favor and, uhh, back up a little
Your breath smells like you downed a whole case of Ripple
Give me the sunshine instead of the rain
Give me the joy instead of the pain
Give me a car instead of a plane
Give me a nice young lady instead of a dame

Ohh, baby! Do me, do me!
Ohh, baby! Do me, do me!

Hickory-Dickory nurse, this happens to be the last verse
This is the one at the end, there was one in the middle
But that was the one after the first
Now let's boil this down to the summary
You have to understand, there's only one of me
I'm like the thickness in your ketchup
When you see me, tip your hat up
I'm like the river so you might as well flow with me
I see me, you took you have 'n' might
Excuse me, may I trouble you for your number?
I happen to be the big Boy Wonder
I'm an overweight pro with a curly afro
'Heavy D' is the name I go under
Let me have a glass of bubbly
Mmm, might as well make that a double, B
I like you, you know you like me
So, do me, baby, do me!

Ohh, baby! Do me, do me!
Ohh, baby! Do me, do me!
Ohh, baby! Do me, do me!
I love the way you dance!
You drop-dead gorgeous, lollipop licking
Spinach sucking, sweet potato pie eating
Luscious Lucy, you..

Ohh, baby! Do me, do me!
Ohh, baby! Do me, do me!
Ohh, baby! Do me, do me!
I love the way you dance!
See ya! All massive hold tight!
All the nasty gal, we love ya, ya know!

Ohh, baby! Do me, do me!
Ohh, baby! Do me, do me!
Ohh, baby! Do me, do me!
