Look, there she goes again, driving in her Benz
She's with a few friends, then again she's with him
I'm really beginning to wonder who 'him' could be
That kid on the block or someone in the family
Maybe it's her brother, I hope it's not her lover
One thing for sure, this lover will discover
Honey, honey, honey, with your magazine look
Pull over the car so your boots can get shook
He's getting out the car (Maybe he isn't)
Should I push up? (Maybe you shouldn't)
I think she's liking me (Maybe she doesn't)
Maybe she was staring (Maybe she wasn't)
Yo, I got to flex 'fore she hits the home stretch
Pull over a sec and let the Lover catch wreck
This may sound funny but, true love, I've found
That it's hard to get down cuz he's always around

See
You're probably used to men that were tall, dark and handsome
But I'm big and beautiful and bright as a candle
Easy to handle and lovely to match
I can say "I love you, baby" in Jamaican or Spanish
Believe me when I tell you I got what you need
I'm not your 'Romeo Romeo' for just as be
He's giving you "the runaround", you're always complaining
Now I'm a push up on you, baby, like a boxer in training
I figured if you fell for him you'll fall for me
But I'd cushion your fall so your fall wouldn't hurt, see
I'm considerate that way
And later on, if you're not busy, we can go out and play
All I want is a piece of your mind
And in due time you'll find
What you want is some of this overweight loving hugging
Forget about that clown and try the Heavster's loving
It's as easy as A-B-C, one-two-three
You and me, one-on-one together we are we
Might sound funny, true love I've found
And it's hard to get down cuz he's always around

Movies, milkshakes, ice cream and cupcakes
Couldn't take the place of having you on my plate
Allow me to be me, let me do my J-O-B
A pen, the gift of gab, a pad is on my knee
Getting ready for a push whether you wish or you whoosh
You can get a squeezed, squashed, squooshed
And served into ????, later maybe sooner
Smooth, like Jackie Gleason from the Honeymooners
I'll be trailing like a tracker, y'all
We can chill at the crib and watch the Giants blow the Packers
Sex is not my goal but definitely in the picture
Things will be fantastic as soon as I get witcha
If honey lamb is single, she and I could mingle
Who's the dude you with? Does your earrings jingle?
A lawyer, doctor, judge or a cop?
Or could it be me? Or just a lollipop
I'm not an easy giver-upper, a quick-to-pick-her -upper
Never stop or stutter, mind's not in the gutter
Very athletic, flamboyant and poetic
If a beat is too clean, Pete Rock will bring the static
Sometimes I'm hard to swallow, I love the Apollo
Used to have a dope rope chain but it was hollow
Now I'm into links; nifty, don't you think?
It's hard to bring me down cuz I'm feelin' in the pink
It may sound funny but true love I've found
It's hard to get down cuz he's always around
It's hard to get down cuz he's always around It's hard to get down cuz he's always around
It's hard to get down cuz he's always around

I wonder where she's going, I better tag along
But I'm not really worried cuz I'm rolling rather strong
Got my man over there saying, "Ya, mon, everyting clear"
My man downtown said "She just came around"
So I just keep trailing even though she thinks I'm failing
I know she's only stalling, my number she'll be calling
Practice makes perfect and perfectly I practised If the proof is in the pudding? I got the pudding to match this
