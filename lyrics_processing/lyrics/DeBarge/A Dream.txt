Last night I dreamed
That you were here with me
And we were in each others arms, it was oh so heavenly
You held me close to you and whispered in my ear
"Let's build a life together, share love beyond compare"

As we danced to the melody
We had so much to share (Then the music stopped)
In a flash I was all alone (It was just a dream)
Haunting me once again

A dream, a simple fantasy
That I, wished was reality
That you'd, come knocking at my door
And we'd, relive this dream once more

The day you left, you said you would return
Just when you wouldn't promise, said you needed time alone
You said you loved me and someday our love could be
I couldn't understand it, I thought we were both happy

As we danced to the melody
We had so much to share (Then the music stopped)
In a flash I was all alone (It was just a dream)
Haunting me once again

A dream, a simple fantasy
(A simple fantasy that I)
That I, wished was reality (Oh, oh, that you, ooh)
That you'd, come knocking at my door
(And we'd) And we'd, relive this dream once more
(Oh, oh, oh, a dream, baby)
A dream, a simple fantasy
(It's just a fantasy that I)
That I, wished was reality
(That you'd, come knocking at my door)
Come knocking at my door
(Oh, and we'd) And we'd, relive this dream once more
A dream

Hold me, love me, with all your heart
Oh, oh, come back
Please make my dream come true for me
I need so much for you to see
I need you to love me once again
Oh, oh, oh, oh baby

A dream, a simple fantasy
(Oh)
That I, wished was reality
(I understand it's a fantasy but you)
That you'd, come knocking at my door
(Come knocking at my door)
(Oh, and we'd) And we'd, relive this dream once more
A dream, a simple fantasy
(A dream, a simple fantasy that I wished was reality, oh baby)
That I, wished was reality
(Oh baby, oh)
That you'd, come knocking at my door
