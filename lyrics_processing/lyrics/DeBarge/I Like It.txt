I've been thinkin' 'bout you, for quite a while
You're on my mind every day and every night
My every thought is you, the things you do
Seem so satisfying to me, I must confess it, girl

(Ooh-ooh, and I like it)
You send chills up my spine every time I take one look at you
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, and I like it)
Girl, you're blowin' my mind with the things you say to me

I like the way you comb your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
It's just the little things you do
That show how much you really care
Like when I'm all alone with you
You know exactly what to do
You put that fire inside of me
And make it more than just a dream

(Ooh-ooh, and I like it)
You send chills up my spine every time I take one look at you
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, and I like it)
(Ooh-ooh, and I like it)
