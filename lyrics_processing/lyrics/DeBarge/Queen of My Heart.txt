She's the queen of my heart
She plays a very great part in me
In me
She's the queen of my heart
And that's a very great start in me
Can't you see?

I don't know why she love me so
Why? I guess I'll never know
But I can tell she really care for me
So, I'll give her love to last a lifetime
That will never die
Oh, how I love that girl
She's the queen of my heart

She's the queen of my heart
She's captured every part in me
In me
She's the queen of my heart
And that's a very great start in me
Can't you see?

I can't explain the joy she brings
She's captured all those hidden things
And no one ever took the time to find
So, I'll give her love to last a lifetime
That will never die
Oh, how I love that girl
She's the queen of my heart
You might also like
I was alone trying to find someone to love me
As I went on my way, I kept my search in pain and misery
For no one cares for me
But that's alright, she'll fight for me, my friend
That's when my baby, she stepped in
And that is why I sing this song for her
She's the queen of my heart

She's the queen of my heart
She plays a very great part in me (In me)
I'm me (In me)
She's the queen of my heart
She plays a very great part in me (In me)
I'm me (In me)
She's the queen of my heart
She plays a very great part in me
In me
She's the queen of my heart
She plays a very great part in me
In me
She's the queen of my heart
She plays a very great part in me
In me
She's the queen of my heart
She plays a very great part in me
