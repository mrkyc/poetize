Every time I call you, you don't ever answer
'Cause you always got to go
First time that I called you, you went to a party
After you went to the show
The second time I called, your brother said he told you
So baby, you've got to know
Girl, if you just don't like me, don't care too much for me
Don't play with my feelings, let me know

Stop, don't tease me
Baby, you've got to please me
My body's burnin' for your love
Ooh, stop, don't tease me
Baby, you've got to please me
You know you really turn me on
You turn me on
(On, on, on, on)
Turn me on
(On, on, on, on)

When you said you liked me
Girl, it went straight through me
I made plans for me and you
Like walkin' out on air
There was nothing really there
And now I feel just like a fool
I thought that I was walking out on concrete
You pulled it from under me
Why you wanna lead me on?
Girl, if you just don't like me, don't care too much for me
Don't play with my feelings, let me know
You might also like
Stop, don't tease me
You've got to please me
Ah baby, don't you know, you better
Ooh, stop, don't tease me
Give it to me
You've got to please me
'Cause I need more than just a taste
You turn me on
(On, on, on, on)
You turn me on
(On, on, on, on)

Hey, you turn me on, you turn me on
Hey, you, you turn me on, you turn me on
Girl, we've gone too far to turn around
Mmm, my body's burning with desire 'cause you turn me on
I want so much, to feel your touch
Ooh, oh, chicka-chicka, bang-bang
Gotta get a little, I know you're gonna love it
Chicka-chicka, bang-bang
Gotta get a little, I know you're gonna love it
Ah, ooh, I'm climbing up the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling you're giving me
And, oh, you've got to stop this teasing
Now's the time for pleasing me, oh yeah
Stop, don't tease me
You've got to please me
Stop, don't tease me
You've got to please me
Oh baby, oh baby, give it to me
Stop, don't tease me
You've got to please me
Gotta get a little doggone lovin'
Stop, don't tease me
You've got to please me
Baby, don't you want my lovin'?
Now you got to stop this teasin', baby
Give it to me
Stop, don't tease me
You've got to please me
Uh,-huh, 'cause I ain't got no time to waste, oh baby
Stop (Give it to me), don't tease me
(Oh) You've got to please me
Girl, I need more than just a taste
Stop, don't tease me
You've got to please me
