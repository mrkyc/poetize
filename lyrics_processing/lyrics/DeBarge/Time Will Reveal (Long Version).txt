What can I do
To make you feel secure
Remove all your doubts
So that you know for sure that you're the apple of my eye, girl
Fulfillment of my dream
Time will show the value
Of just what you mean to me
More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings
Or anything that I could give you
It wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you there to guide you through
But ain't it good to know you do

I know just how you feel
But this time, love's for real
In time, it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us
Will all reveal in time, oh

I tell you I love you
But you won't believe it's true
More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings
Or anything that I could give you
It wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you there to guide you through
But ain't it good to know you do, ah
You might also like
I know just how you feel
But this time, love's for real
In time, it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us
Will all reveal in time
I know just how you feel
But this time, love's for real
In time, it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us
Will all reveal in time, oh

Say, baby
Yeah, baby
Anything that I could give you
It wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you there to guide you through
But ain't it good to know you do, ah

I know just how you feel
But this time, love's for real
In time, it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us
Will all reveal in time
I know just how you feel
But this time, love's for real
In time, it will reveal
Hey, oh, that special love that's deep inside of us
Will all reveal in time
I know just how you feel
So let your little heart lay down, my darling
In time, it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us
Will all reveal in time
I know just how you feel
But this time, love's for real
In time, it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us
Will all reveal in time
