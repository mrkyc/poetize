And the walls came
And the walls came tumbling
She took me to the theater to see her favorite show
The people in the back makin' too much noise so I decided I was ready to go
So she took me out to her car for a friendly little kiss
And out of nowhere, out of thin air, here's another man with a chip on his shoulder
He said, hey I don't like what I see
The girl you're with belongs to me
So I jumped back, and reached for my slack
And the walls came tumbling down
The walls came tumbling down, down
And the walls came tumbling down, down
Oh this is crazy, I didn't do it for your affection
You really don't mean that much to me
I only did it for my own protection
You knew about it all the time
But then you thought to blow my mind
You're just another young girl, fresh out of school
Hang it up, it'll never work
She said, hey let me love ya
Ooh, let me love ya
Then she jumped in my arms and we started to kiss

And the walls came tumbling down, down
Down, down, down, down, down...
Down, down...
And the walls came tumbling down, down
And the walls came tumbling down, down
And the walls came tumbling down, down
And the walls came tumbling down, down
And the walls came tumbling down
And the walls
And the walls came
And the walls came tumbling down
And the walls came tumbling down
Down
And the walls came tumbling down
Down
And the walls came tumbling down
Old man Jones has a heart attack
Sleepin' with the neighbor's daughter
She was only sixteen, he was sixty-five
Involuntary manslaughter
Uh uh oh, what a shame
Life is just a game
He played to win but then he lost in the end
