Can't stop this feeling that I feel inside
I'm bubbling over and I just can't hide
Such a sweet sensation has come over me
In your arms for sure is where I want to be
My doubts and fears all seem to disappear
When I'm with you I feel safe and secure
Never dreamt this moment would come to be
Where I'm not just loving, someone's really loving me

It's getting stronger, baby, every day (Stronger)
Can't hold out longer, got to break away (Stronger)
It's getting stronger, baby, every day (Stronger)
Can't hold out longer, got to break away

I know you love me 'cause you show me how
You never turn me down, that's not your style
I can't stop this feeling that's come over me
I'm so proud that our love's reached its destiny
It took some time, but hey, we made it there
We've opened up, our hearts have much to share
Never dreamt this moment would come to be
Where I'm not just loving, someone's really loving me

Can't hold out longer got to break away
