To the beat of the rhythm of the night
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
To the beat of the rhythm of the night


When it feels like the world is on your shoulders
And all of the madness has got you going crazy
It's time to get out, step out into the street
Where all of the action is right there at your feet

Well, I know a place where we can dance the whole night away
Underneath electric stars
Just come with me and we can shake your blues right away
You'll be doing fine once the music starts, oh

To the beat of the rhythm of the night
(Dance until the morning light)
Forget about the worries on your mind
(You can leave them all behind)
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
(Oh, the rhythm of the night, oh yeah)
You might also like
Look out on the street now, the party's just beginning
The music's playing, a celebration's starting
Under the street lights the scene is being set
A night for romance, a night you won't forget

So, come join the fun, this ain't no time to be staying home
Ooh, there's too much going on, oh
Tonight is gonna be a night like you've never known
We're gonna have a good time the whole night long, oh

To the beat of the rhythm of the night
(Dance until the morning light)
Forget about the worries on your mind
(You can leave them all behind)
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
(Oh, the rhythm of the night, oh yeah)


Come join the fun, this ain't no time to be staying home
Ooh, there's too much going on, oh
Tonight is gonna be a night like you've never known
We're gonna have a good time the whole night long, oh

The night, the night
The night, the night

To the beat of the rhythm of the night
(Dance until the morning light)
Forget about the worries on your mind

To the beat of the rhythm of the night
(Dance until the morning light)
Forget about the worries on your mind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night

Forget about the worries on your mind (Oh)
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
