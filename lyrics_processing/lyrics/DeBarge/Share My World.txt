Ooh, la-la-la
Won't you share my world
Ooh, won't you share my world
Won't you share my world

Don't just stand around and say
I've made your life complete
And how I make you feel each day
Whenever our lips meet
You say you really love me so don't hesitate
To come and share my world
Please won't you share it
I gave you all the love I had
And gladly give you more
Love has found a way for us
To walk right through the door
And everlasting love
That's made for you and me
And it's reality
Can't you see?

You've placed a seed love in me
And made it grow each day
And now it blooms a fruit of love for you
And if you really love me, yes, the way that I love you
Won't you please share my world
You might also like
I want you

I want you
I need you to share my world
Share my world
Baby, baby, won't you share my world, world

The sun puts on a smile for two
Every time we meet
And all that life has brought us through
It never will compete
With all the happiness we share together
If you share my world
Please, won't you share my world
Please, won't you share my world

I love you
I need you to share my world
Share my world
Life can be so beautiful
