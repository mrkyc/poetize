You know that she is just a heartbreak in disguise
You know that falling for the girl is not so wise
But every time your mind wants you to stay away
Your heart just looks the other way

Oh, oh, she's all that you want now
Oh, oh, she's nothin' you need
No, oh, but there you go
Blame it all on love, you know you should know better

But the heart is not so smart
Can't always trust it, no
The heart is not so smart
Goes where it should not go
Always seems to find
Its way to trouble, no
The heart is not so smart
Oh no, oh no

The heart's been broken, it's been bruised and it's been burned
So after that you'd think a lesson might be learned
But it keeps falling for the same lines every time
Sometimes the heart can be so blind
You might also like
Oh, oh, and when you discover
Oh, oh, she's telling you lies
Oh, oh, well, don't you know
That the heart is always last to realize

Because the heart is not so smart
Can't always trust it, no
The heart is not so smart
Goes where it should not go
Always seems to find
Its way to trouble, no
The heart is not so smart
Oh no


Oh, they say trust your emotions
Oh, oh, your feelings inside
Oh, oh, but when it comes to love
Sometimes it's better that the heart is not your guide
Because the heart is not so smart
The heart is not so smart
The heart is not so smart
Can't always trust it, no
The heart is not so smart
Goes where it should not go
Always seems to find
Its way to trouble, no
The heart is not so smart
Whoa-oh, whoa, oh oh
The heart is not so smart
No no no no
The heart is not so smart
Whoa-oh, whoa, oh, oh
The heart is not so smart, no no
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
The heart is not so smart
You can't always trust it, no
The heart is not so smart
No no no no
The heart is not so smart
Whoa-oh, whoa, oh oh
The heart is not so smart, no, no
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, whoa
The heart is not so smart
Can't always trust it, no
The heart is not so smart
No, no, no, no
The heart is not so smart
Whoa-oh, whoa, oh, oh
The heart is not so smart, no no
