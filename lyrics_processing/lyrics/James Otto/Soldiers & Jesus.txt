In a pine box covered in red, white, and blue
He was one of the brave and the proud and the few
21 guns helped us say goodbye
I stood there in silence trying hard not to cry
As the preacher he quoted lines written in red
And he folded his bible in a broken voice he said
There's only two people whose ever died for me
Laid down their lives just so I could be free
They both went through hell bared crosses and shells
And both got back up again after they fell
They never pick a fight but their there to pick up the pieces
God only knows where we'd be without soldiers and Jesus
It seems like the news loves to run em both down
Whenever we need em there always around
So don't hand me a parties political views
There's left side and right side and then there's the truth
There's only two people whose ever died for me
Laid down their lives just so I could be free
They both went through hell bared crosses and shells
And both got back up again after they fell
They never pick a fight but their there to pick up the pieces
God only knows where we'd be without soldiers and Jesus
To me there both heroes for the path that they chose
One fights for my life one fights for my soul
There's only two people whose ever died for me
Laid down their lives just so I could be free
They both went through hell bared crosses and shells
And both got back up again after they fell
They never pick a fight but their there to pick up the pieces
God only knows where we'd be without soldiers and Jesus
Soldiers and Jesus
