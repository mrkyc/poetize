If it stays like this I'm gonna lose my mind
Yeah, the time's gone
I gotta have a little fun
I gotta get up, get out of the house
Hop in my ride and go downtown
And have a beer
I'm tired of just sitting here
Now the whole damn world goes a hell in a bucket
Falling apart, kind of me sucking
Ain't got no job, ain't got no luck
And can't do nothing about it, might as well say
It's a good time for a good time
Dancing in the sunshine
Lots of worries thrown on down the road
Come on and free your mind
It's a good time for a good time, yeah
It's a good time for a good time, mmm, yeah
We've all come here to shake our blues
Bet a little bit and drink some booze
And forget the day
It's time to have a little break
It's funny how the things that are bad for you
Seem to be the only things that'll get you through
It takes the years away
But who need a man awake?
When the whole damn world's gone to hell in a bucket
Falling apart, kind of me sucking
Ain't got no job, ain't got no luck
And can't do nothing about it, might as well say
It's a good time for a good time
Dancing in the sunshine
Lots of worries thrown on down the road
Come on and free your mind
It's a good time for a good time, yeah
It's a good time for a good time
Yeah, the whole damn world's gone to hell in a bucket
Falling apart, kind of me sucking
Ain't got no job, ain't got no luck
And can't do nothing about it, might as well say
It's a good time for a good time
Dancing in the sunshine
Lots of worries thrown on down the road
Come on and free your mind
It's a good time for a good time, yeah
It's a good time for a good time, mmm, yeah
Some days I just wanna say
"Forget it"
I'm out of here, man
