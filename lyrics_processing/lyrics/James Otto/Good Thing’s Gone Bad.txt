Someone's been steppin' in
While you've been steppin' out
You thought you were slick, my friend
You thought you had it figured out
Honey
But she was tired of bein' used
Heard your last bad excuse
Never thought she'd cut you loose
Don't look so surprised
You know you had it comin'
If you hadn't have stayed out all night long
(You wouldn't be sittin' here wonderin' why)
(Waitin' by the phone with a tear in your eye)
Runnin' all over town doin' her wrong
(Actin' like you ain't got a thing to lose)
(Thinkin' you're a player but you're playin' a fool)
Maybe you could've held on to what you had
(Should've treated her better when you had the chance)
Good thing's gone bad, yeah, it has
I know when you come and go
And I know how long you'll be
But don't look across the street
For sympathy
'Cause you're not gonna get it
Well, you're such a busy man
She don't seem to fit your plans
I'll take her off your hands
Don't worry 'bout it, brother
You know I got you covered
If you hadn't have stayed out all night long
(You wouldn't be sittin' here wonderin' why)
(Waitin' by the phone with a tear in your eye)
Runnin' all over town doin' her wrong
(Actin' like you ain't got a thing to lose)
(Thinkin' you're a player but you're playin' a fool)
Maybe you could've held on to what you had
(Should've treated her better when you had the chance)
Good thing's gone bad, yeah, it has
If you hadn't have stayed out all night long
(You wouldn't be sittin' here wonderin' why)
