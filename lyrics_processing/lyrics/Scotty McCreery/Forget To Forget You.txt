If you see my number on your phone when you pick it up
Or get a good morning text when your waking up
Or see my truck driving by at the end of the day
If you get a letter in the mail from me now and then
Or find a note on your door from me checking in
If I send you a rose or a whole bouquet
Well, pay no mind
I just forget to forget you sometimes

It ain't nothing but a habit, I can break it
I can shake it, I can make it on my own
Ain't like I really care or I miss you
Or it matters or I wish you weren't gone
Don't think I'm that
God, I got to get you back
Probably never going to get over you kind
I just forget to forget you sometimes

I wish you would've caught me out rocking last night
Instead of catching me sitting at this green light
Baby, I was on a roll 'til I heard that song
It ain't nothing but a ghost then it's gone again
Ain't like I'm still stuck in what could'a been
Every part of me wants to be moving on
Except the back of my mind
It just forgets to forget you sometimes
