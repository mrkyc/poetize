I believe this life we're livin'
Ain't all there is
And there's somethin' better up there
Waitin' after this
I've sat on Sunday mornings
Listened to that preacher preach
And I get what he's sayin'
But man, if you ask me

You think pearly gates
You think streets of gold
And I think about them long leaf pines
Lined on Tobacco Road
You think skies of blue
You think angels' wings
I think grandpa on an old creek bank
And a Zebco 33
And we all got our own opinions
We all believe what we believe
But everything that's Heaven to you
Is Carolina to me

I've already walked with Jesus
Goin' through Kill Devil Hills
And I've talked to God face to face
Sittin' high up in Linville
But if you still want your mansion
And your perfect paradise
Then go on and get yours
And I'll head on back to mine

You think pearly gates
You think streets of gold
And I think about them long leaf pines
Lined on Tobacco Road
You think skies of blue
You think angels' wings
I think wild horses on the Outer Banks
Runnin' up and down the beach
And we all got our own opinions
We all believe what we believe
But everything that's Heaven to you
Is Carolina to me

Well, if you still want your mansion
And your perfect paradise
Then go on and get yours
And I'll head on back to mine

You think pearly gates
You think streets of gold
And I think about them long leaf pines
Lined on Tobacco Road
You think skies of blue
You think angels' wings
And I think about ol' Andy Griffith
Whistlin' on TV
And we all got our own opinions
We all believe what we believe
But everything that's Heaven to you
Is Carolina to me
