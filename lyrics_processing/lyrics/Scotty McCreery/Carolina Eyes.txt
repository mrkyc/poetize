We were young, it was summer
Just a little town on the edge of the water
I've never been down there before
I met ya, picking up shells on that seashore
Your smile was pulling me under
Then you said your name, and it was game over

Yeah girl, I fell so far in love with you
'Cause I told my heart I had nothing to lose
When time ain't on your side
You're wondering which kiss is going to mean goodbye
And I opened up and threw all my love your way
Said words to you I'd never heard me say
I just sat there that night
And let your Carolina eyes pull me in
'Cause I never thought I'd see you again

If I'd only known a feeling like that
Would hit me once and it'd never come back
I'd of gone ahead and made you mine
Instead of trying to move on and wasting my time
Looking for what I already found
A few years back in that little beach town

Yeah girl, I fell so far in love with you
'Cause I told my heart I had nothing to lose
When time ain't on your side
You're wondering which kiss is going to mean goodbye
And I opened up and threw all my love your way
Said words to you I'd never heard me say
I just sat there that night
And let your Carolina eyes pull me in
'Cause I never thought I'd see you again

Is it luck running into you so unexpectedly
Or is it fate that put you here in front of me

Yeah girl, I fell so far in love with you
'Cause I told my heart I had nothing to lose
When time ain't on your side
You're wondering which kiss is going to mean goodbye
And I opened up and threw all my love your way
Said words to you I'd never heard me say
I just sat there that night
And let your Carolina eyes pull me in
