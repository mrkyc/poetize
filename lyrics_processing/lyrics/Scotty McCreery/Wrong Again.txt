It was only
Just a little slow dancing
Just a little romancing
On a Friday night
We shared some drinks
Yeah only a couple
But it sure wasn't nothing
That would change my life

I just knew there was
Nothing to it just
Me and you and a
Quick kiss goodbye

Wrong again
'Cause your hand's still sitting here in mine
This kiss been going on all night
Look at you baby, look at you
Just goes to show what I thought I knew
Moon's gone but here comes the sunrise
Find myself getting lost in your eyes
Never thought I'd feel something so right
Wrong again

It was only just
A couple months dating
Just anticipating
For it to go south
It'd been nothing more
Than anything else
Oh 'cause everybody else
Didn't stick around

I just knew there was
Nothing to it just
Me and you until
We just burned out

Wrong again
'Cause your hand's still sitting here in mine
This kiss been going on all night
Look at you baby, look at you
Just goes to show what I thought I knew
Moon's gone but here comes the sunrise
Find myself getting lost in your eyes
Never thought I'd feel something so right
Well it looks like I'm wrong again
I was never ever ever
Absolutely never ever
Gonna hit one knee
And you would never ever ever
Absolutely never ever
Gonna say yes to me

Wrong again
'Cause your hand's still sitting here in mine
This kiss been going on all night
Look at you baby, look at you
Just goes to show what I thought I knew
Moon's gone but here comes the sunrise
Find myself getting lost in your eyes
Never thought I'd feel something so right
Yeah I sure am glad that I was wrong again
Yeah I'm wrong again, nothing new

It was only
Just a little slow dancing
Just a little romancing
