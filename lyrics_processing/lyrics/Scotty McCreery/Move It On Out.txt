Been grittin' and grinding this nine to five
And I think I done had enough
All of these boring coffee pot pouring mornings are getting tough
Well it's quittin' time and man alive
Pop a top and hold 'em high
Saturday is on its way
So find a beach, find a lake

Pack it on up, move it on out
Baby, I know that you know what I'm talking about
Your hand in my hand, and a can in the other
Let's jump on in
Baby give me another kiss on these lips
Jealous of the sand hanging onto your hips
Let's get out of town, I'm down if you're down
Pack it on up, move it on out

Summertime's a wastin
Girl, grab your things and lets fire up the truck
You got me dying to see what's hiding underneath
That damned old cover-up
So let's turn the key and hit the road
Get Buffet on the radio
Got a pocket full of cash
And a Ford full of gas

Pack it on up, move it on out
Baby, I know that you know what I'm talking about
Your hand in my hand, and a can in the other
Let's jump on in
Baby give me another kiss on these lips
Jealous of the sand hanging onto your hips
Let's get out of town, I'm down if you're down
Pack it on up, move it on out

Shaking the sand right off of your hips
Kissing the sun right off of them lips
Shaking the sand right off of your hips
Kissing the sun...
Pack it on up, move it on out
Baby, I know that you know what I'm talking about
Your hand in my hand, and a can in the other
Let's jump on in
Baby give me another...kiss on these lips
Jealous of the sand hanging onto your hips
Let's get out of town, I'm down if you're down
Pack it on up, move it on out

Girl, what you say?
Let's move it on out
Pack it on up, and move it on out
Go pack it on up
