I love the mountains when the leaves start turnin'
I love the coast when the waves roll in
I love some back porch firewood burnin'
I love my couch when a long day ends, mm
But when I first laid eyes on you, mm
That's when I knew

I've never known a love like this
I've never felt this way
Girl, I think I might have thought I did
But everything changed today
'Cause I'm lookin' at you, lookin' at him
And I don't have a clue what this feelin' is
But watching you give our baby boy a kiss
Now I know
I've never known a love like this, no

It was four thirty-four on a Monday mornin'
A miracle in room two thirty-five
Nurse says, "Do you wanna hold 'emm?"
I picked him up and started to cry, mm
Our family of two is now a family of three, mm
Yeah, now I see

I've never known a love like this
I've never felt this way
Girl, I think I might have thought I did
But everything changed today
'Cause I'm lookin' at you, lookin' at him
And I don't have a clue what this feelin' is
But watching you give our baby boy a kiss
Now I know
I've never known a love like this
I've never known a love like this, no

I never slept so little, I never felt so much
Never sent so many prayers up
Because I've never known, I've never ever known

I've never known a love like this
I've never felt this way
Girl, I think I might have thought I did
But our whole world changed today
'Cause I'm lookin' at you, lookin' at him
I don't have a clue what this feelin' is
But watching you give our baby boy a kiss
Now I know
I've never known a love like this, no
No, I've never known a love like this, no
Mm-mm
