Remember when I told you you were mine, all mine
I couldn't get you baby off my mind
It was young love, not a fling
Me and you we were the real thing
Remember when I told you we should take a drive
You didn't know but I had butterflies
'Cause I knew then, leaning in
Baby I was never looking back again

Every day changes but it doesn't change
The way you make me smile when you say my name
And when you laugh, it makes me laugh
And when you cry, it makes me cry

Yeah like it did back then
When we were just beginning
And girl it always will
But I want you, I need you, still

And I don't care how many times that story is told
Cover to cover it never gets old
Like a fairy tale, gets better and better
Boy meets girl and spends forever together

Every day changes but it doesn't change
The way you make me smile when you say my name
And when you laugh, it makes me laugh
And when you cry, it makes me cry

Yeah like it did back then
When we were just beginning
And girl it always will
I want you, I need you, still

Yeah, oh my God
You are my whole world
And we spinnin' it
When you look my way
Everything stops
And time stands still

Every day changes but it doesn't change
The way you make me smile when you say my name
And when you laugh, it makes me laugh
And when you cry, it makes me cry
Every day changes but it doesn't change
The way you make me smile when you say my name
And when you laugh, it makes me laugh
And when you cry, girl, it makes me cry
Yeah like it did back then
When we were just beginning
And girl it always will
I want you, I need you, still
