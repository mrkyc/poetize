Girl, you know I love talking to you on the phone
I could listen to your sweet voice all night long
Sometimes I can get by with a sweet dreams baby good night
But this time, well, I don't wanna spend it alone

So I'm coming over, I hope it's alright
Listen for me pulling into your drive
Look out your window, you'll see my lights
Baby girl, I gotta see you tonight
The way the breeze is blowing, blowing
Got me wishing I was holding, holding
Onto you so tight under that porch light
But girl, I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight
Girl, I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight

I got a couple hundred pictures of your pretty face
On my phone, on my dash, all over the place
But I would drive a million miles
Just to see that little smile in real life
Baby, it's worth the drive
You're worth the drive

So I'm coming over, I hope it's alright
Listen for me pulling into your drive
Look out your window, you'll see my lights
Baby girl, I gotta see you tonight
The way the breeze is blowing, blowing
Got me wishing I was holding, holding
Onto you so tight under that porch light
But girl, I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight
Girl, I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight

No, I don't care what time it is
I just gotta get a little moonlight kiss
Girl, I can't help it when I feel like this
There's only one thing to do
Baby, I'm missing you

I'm coming over, I hope it's alright
Listen for me pulling into your drive
Look out your window, you'll see my lights
Baby girl, I gotta see you tonight
The way the breeze is blowing, blowing
Got me wishing I was holding, holding
Onto you so tight under that porch light
But girl, I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight
Yeah, girl, I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight (Yeah, yeah)
