I've sent a dozen text and I ain't heard jack
I guess she's busy playin' hard to get back
So I bought roses and her favorite wine
Thinkin' we'd be makin' up in no time
But I'm parked out here on her street
Looks like the joke's on me

Sittin' here, I can't believe what I just saw
Couple shadows kissin' on her bedroom wall
It's lookin' like my plan didn't work out at all
Our break turned into broke up
So now I'm findin' out how a heartbreak taste
With a Silver Oak, 1998
Drinkin' cab in a solo
Solo in the cab of my truck


Yeah, I thought about takin' it back to the store
'Cause it's the nicest bottle that I ever paid for
But then again, if I had that money back
I'd just find a bar and go run up a tab
I could go for a whiskey, I could go for a beer
But hell, I'm already here

She just turned out the lights
Guess she meant it when she said goodbye

Man, I swear, I can't believe what I just saw
Couple shadows kissin' on her bedroom wall
It's lookin' like my plan didn't work out at all
That break turned into broke up
