It's been a long time gone, been a long time coming
It's a new beat, gonna hit the ground running
Been a while since I felt this way
But it's a brand new me, yeah it's a brand new day
Can't keep a man down when he's on the way up
Can't keep it in park when there's gas in the truck
Red light, yellow light, green light, go
Everybody knows

Seasons change
Turning a new leaf, rolling up my sleeves
Sitting on G, waiting on O
Now the sun's out baby I'm ready to roll
Wintertime, springtime, summertime, fall
Good times, bad times, been through them all
Just when you think you can't make it through the rain
Your seasons change, oh
Your seasons change, yeah

When you just can't find the right piece to the puzzle
There's no light at the end of the tunnel
Don't sweat it, don't fret it, put your boots on the ground
It'll come back around
'Cause sometimes going through all the bad weather
Makes the sun shine that much better
Right here right now is what it's all about
So breathe in, breathe out
Just breathe in, breathe out
