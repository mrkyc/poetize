Eight years old, a couple cane poles
Sittin' down by the creek
Our lines in the water, watching those bobbers
Seein' that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yelling "Supper's hot
Y'all come and get it!"
We yelled five more minutes

At sixteen it was twelve o three
Standin' at her front door
Katie's dad said midnight
But we needed just a little more
Yellow light flipping on and off
Interruptin' that goodnight kissing
We wanted five more minutes

Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes

At eighteen, turned my helmet in
And walked to the fifty-yard line
It's just the coach and me after we
Lost state, ten to nine
And I cried, "Man next time to get in here
I'll have to buy a ticket"
Can't you give me five more minutes?

Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes

At eighty-six, my grandpa said
There's angels in the room
With all the family gathered 'round
We knew that time was coming soon
With so much left to say I prayed
Lord, I ain't finished
Just give us five more minutes
Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
Yeah, sometimes this old life will leave you wishing
That you had five more minutes
