(I'm feelin' it)

Pop tops popping
Flip-flops flopping
Drop tops dropping down
Ray-Bans raying
Waves are wavin'
Ladies are layin' out
Feelin' it

IPods rocking
Sunblock blockin'
Igloos stockin' up (Yep)
Cutoffs are cuttin'
Worry 'bout nothin'
But puttin' something in my cup (Feelin' it)

And I can't, I can't find nothing wrong
With nothing, nothing that's goin' on
It's making me wanna sing a song
That goes like this

Whoa, oh, whoa
Ain't nothin' like feeling that summertime feelin'
Kicked back, relaxed, just chillin'
I'm feelin', I'm feelin' it
Whoa, oh, whoa
Ain't nothing like diggin' that summertime
Diggin' in the sand, gettin' tan
With your hand in my hand
I'm feelin' it
Oh yeah, I'm feelin' it

Rip tide ripping
Skim board skimming
Sip, sippin' somethin' on ice (Fill it up)
Hot gets hotter
Head to the water
Jump into paradise (Feelin' it)

And I can't, I can't find nothing wrong
With nothing, nothing that's goin' on
It's making me wanna sing a song
That goes like this (Like this)
Whoa, oh, whoa
Ain't nothin' like feeling that summertime feelin'
Kicked back, relaxed, just chillin'
I'm feelin', I'm feelin' it
Whoa, oh, whoa
Ain't nothing like diggin' that summertime
Diggin' in the sand, gettin' tan
With your hand in my hand
I'm feelin' it
Oh, I'm feelin' it

Sunset settin'
Getting good's gettin'
Good as it can get
Lip gloss glossin'
No more talkin'
Baby, givin' me a kiss
(Feelin' it)

Whoa, oh, whoa
Ain't nothin' like feeling that summertime feelin'
Kicked back, relaxed, just chillin'
I'm feelin', I'm feelin' it
Whoa, oh, whoa
Ain't nothing like diggin' that summertime
Diggin' in the sand, gettin' tan
With your hand in my hand
I'm feelin' it
Whoa, oh, whoa
Pop tops poppin'
IPod's rockin'
(Whoa, oh, whoa)
Flip-flops flopping
