Sweet love doth now invite
Thy graces that refrain
To do me due delight
To see, to hear
To touch, to kiss
To die with thee again
In sweetest sympathy
To see, to hear
To touch, to kiss
To die with thee again
In sweetest sympathy
Come again
That I may cease to mourn
Through thy unkind disdain
For now left and forlorn
I sit, I sigh
I weep, I faint
I die, in deadly pain
And endless misery
I sit, I sigh
I weep, I faint
I die, in deadly pain
And endless misery
You might also likeAll the day
The sun that lends me shine
By frowns do cause me pine
And feeds me with delay;
Her smiles, my springs
That makes my joys
To grow, Her frowns, her frowns
The Winters of my woe
Her smiles, my springs
That makes my joys
To grow, Her frowns, her frowns
The Winters of my woe
All the night
My sleeps are full of dreams
My eyes are full of streams
My heart takes no delight
To see the fruits
And joys that some
Do find and mark the storms
Are me assign'd
To see the fruits
And joys that some
Do find And mark the storms
Are me assign'd
Out alas
My faith is ever true
Yet will she never rue
Nor yield me any grace;
Her eyes of fire
Her heart of flint
Is made, whom tears nor truth
Nor truth may once invade
Her eyes of fire
Her heart of flint
Is made, whom tears nor truth
Nor truth may once invade
Gentle love
Draw forth thy wounding dart:
Thou canst not pierce her heart;
For I that do approve
By sighs and tears
More hot than are
Thy shafts, did tempt while she
While she for triumphs laughs
By sighs and tears
More hot than are
Thy shafts, did tempt while she
