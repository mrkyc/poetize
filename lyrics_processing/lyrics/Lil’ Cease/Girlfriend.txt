Woah, I
Ohh
Gotta learn to love myself

Yo, you got some nerve, ho, while Irv blow, form as Leo
Watchin' the Roy Jones fight in the third row
Chick like, "Cease, you the hottest I heard, yo"
I'm like, "Yeah right, trick," Brist' like, "Word, yo"
I spin around see my ex, I ain't hurt though
She had to see my face, ice made my shirt blow
Work ho, no thong on with her skirt low
Skate with the eight but don't take that bird, yo
Cats gettin' deals and I ain't aggie
I got Regis 'round the world and they ain't Kathie
I got money and I ain't happy
Chick 'bout to have a baby and I ain't the daddy
I used to get my dough dirty, now I get dough a smarter way
If you owe a penny pair, don't get it the harder way
I don't know why rappers don't give me gifts on Father's Day
My son get out of line, he get it like Marvin Gaye, come on (So how can I)

How can I love somebody else when (Woo-woo)
When I can't love myself enough to know (Baby, yeah, ooh-hoo)
When it's time (When it's time)
Time to let go (When it's time to let go)
Time to let go, time to let go, oh (Time to let go, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yeah, yeah, uh, yo, yo
Girlfriend, why you lookin' mad stressed?
When the last time you and your man had sex?
Gimme that number and that address
It come with somethin' with easy access
I said, "Are you shyless? Or are you guyless?
Oh, you straight up posin' topless?" She said
"Try this, my name's Iris
I'm from Cyprus, half black and half Irish, uh
I got a man, but he beats me, don't know how to treat me
If you wanna get freaky, beep me, you like that?"
Yeah, I like that, when I beeped her, she called me right back
I laid my game down quite flat
She said she wearin' white pants at the station
Threw on my white hat with no hesitation
White Benz, white Nav', white-on-white racin'
Thinkin' to myself, "She might be on the flight with Mason" (How can I)

How can I (Yeah, yeah) love somebody else when
When I can't love myself enough to know (Oh when I, when I can't, no-no-no-no, no, no)
When it's time (When it's time, baby)
Time to let go (When it's time to let go, oh, when it's time)
Time to let go, time to let go, oh (To let go, when it's time to let go)
Easily, security to Cease A Le'
Don't pat him down, player, he's with me
I know, every girl in this club wanna leave with me
But right now, only three with me, uh
I went from eatin' on paper plates to Jeeps with paper plates
So a chick can, come before my paperchase
Wanna hit the cell, Roc make 'em wait
If I ain't make a mill, I can't take a break
I love to vacate down in Bermuda
Sip my Kahlua while I'm headed down to Hooters
Every time she scoop her, the chick is with her tutor
Girls wanna fight and throwin' ice from the cooler
This chick is a loser, smoke on nigga's buddah
Dick ride on every nigga's scooter
Same shit she said about me, she said about Gutta
But if it wasn't for this rap shit, I never would have knew her (How can I)

How can I love somebody else when (Oh, yay)
When I can't love myself enough to know (Hey, yay, hey)
When it's time (When it's time, when it's time)
Time to let go (When it's time to let go, oh, baby)
Time to let go, time to let go, oh (Time to let go, let go, yeah)
How can I (How can I) love somebody else when (Oh-ho)
When I can't love myself enough to know (Woha, ay, yay)
When it's time
Time to let go (When it's time to let go, oh, when it's time, when it's time)
Time to let go, time to let go, oh (Time to let go, time to let go, oh, woah)
How can I love someone else?
Oh-ho, woah
