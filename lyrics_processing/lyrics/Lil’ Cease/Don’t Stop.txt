Uh
Yeah
Uh (One-two, one-two, one-two, ya'll)
(Uh)
Uh, yeah
Uh (Mafia)
Yo, yo, yo, yo

It's Lil Cease nigga
About to blow charm like pop
In the Benz drop
I'm hot, you're not
Pedal to the floor
Four-fifth, guard my watch
I'm the nigga you're bitch love to clock
Be the artist stand , gettin head in the lot
Outside of Justin's, in the parking lot
Peep the feds on the low, in the darkest spot
Like Jigga, my lifestyle is just hard to knock
A nigga with more juice than 2Pac
My crew moves spots
Three for my niggas in the yard in the box
Commissary, zip-call, all a nigga got
I'm a ball till I fall
Land on acres
Get this paper
Slide like Don Juan at Gators
If ya feel me on this
Then my words will save ya
If ya wanna talk to me, nigga talk paper
Chips, fuck 'em
I want potatoes, now fuck later

We won't stop, till you niggas come and stick me and I don't stop
Till you haters rock wit me and I won't stop
Till I'm dead here wit fifty and we don't stop
We won't stop
And we don't stop
You know who run the city and we don't stop
Till my dogs rock for Biggie and we don't stop
Till the feds come and get me and we won't stop
We don't stop

Uh, Yo, yo, yo
All a nigga need is
One shot, one brick
Four niggas and four clips
Mo thugs and four-fifths
We car-jacked a few whips
Apartment on the hot strip
Feds come, we lose it
Pissy off of party and bullshit
Till we max out
If it's beef then act out, (Nigga)
So fuck all ya'll cats wit ya ass out
Yappin bout ya crackhouse
Creepin on the low
C-Gutter tear his back out
I ain't scared a ya'll
Trust me, ya'll ain't ready
Need to bring ya bitch
Cause she more heavy than metal
My guns rock steady
The more the merry
Niggas hall ass, break fast like Mob Berry (that's right)
Before I land three like Dell Curry (that's real)
I'm tryna blow like Kurtis
All that shit you doing, is makin me nervous
Nervous, join the service
That paranoid shit could hurt us
Kill us
Down to D.I.E. for B.I., nigga's reality
You wanna battle nigga, bring ya large salary
And ya whole team to tackle me, nigga
You be the last to fuck after me
Money L, D-Rock
Niggas ain't fuckin wit me
We won't stop, till you niggas come and stick me and I don't stop
Till you haters rock wit me and I won't stop
Till I'm dead here wit fifty and we don't stop
We won't stop
And we don't stop
You know who run the city and we don't stop
Till my dogs rock for Biggie and we don't stop
Till the feds come and get me and we won't stop (Yo, yo)
We don't stop (Yo)

I'ma switch hits on niggas
Drop hits on niggas
Switch V's on niggas
Platinum to the quadrup on niggas
Two to the point to the five on niggas
Roll hard with the wildest niggas
In the cut, we can't find us niggas
Livest niggas
Ice be shinin niggas
Blindin niggas
In the four point six, reclining niggas
Bitches like "damn, I got to find this nigga"
If your figure seven digits, got to dial this nigga
And you know I'm on top, you gotta watch me nigga
And my dogs shoot the ball till you foul me nigga
And when the beefs on, you gon' drown, my nigga
I'ma ride for real and wish death to the fake ones
This is for my niggas that was down since day one, that bid long
Hang in and hang on
Hold ya head and stay strong, my niggas
We won't stop, till you niggas come and stick me and I don't stop
Till you haters rock wit me and I won't stop
Till I'm dead here wit fifty and we don't stop
We won't stop
And we don't stop
You know who run the city and we don't stop
Till my dogs rock for Biggie and we don't stop
Till the feds come and get me and we won't stop
We don't stop
We won't stop, till you niggas come and stick me and I don't stop
Till you haters rock wit me and I won't stop
Till I'm dead here wit fifty and we don't stop
We won't stop
And we don't stop
You know who run the city and we don't stop
Till my dogs rock for Biggie and we don't stop
