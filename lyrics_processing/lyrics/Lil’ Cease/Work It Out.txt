An i got keys to V's, you can start it
But if ya can't end it don't jump up in it
But if I hit it, I'll let you slide cause my windows tinted
Like my seats, we fleet yous and me between the sheets

Where I live I preach
And ya know talk is cheap when ya walk wit heat
I keep my cubans wit my Jesus peace
Niggas mad cause I get more ass than wases

Niggas hate it
You don't like us you just gotta face it
When my guns bust niggas know they can't take it
