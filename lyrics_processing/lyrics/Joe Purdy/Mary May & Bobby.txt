When Mary May let Bobby walk her home from school
He had her books in hand and he was listening to every word she said
Like it was the gospel or the prophecies
And he loved the way her hair fell across her dress
Went home singing who wrote the book of love and try a little tenderness, yeah
The next day on the playground Bobby sat Mary down
On the swingset behind the sandbox
And she said, "Bobby I just want to play
So what is this you have to say?"
He said, "Mary, marry me
We could live out by the sea
Like they do on the movie screens
Oh, marry me, Mary May, Before you go back to play."
It was graduation day
They were waiting on a plane to take Mary away
She said, "There's nothing left for me here but you
Bobby, I hope that you can find yourself too
There's so much that I wish to know
And I have to do this on my own
And I hope that you can understand
Bobby, write me when you can"
And he said, "Take my high school ring
So from time to time now you can think of me
And there's just one more thing before you leave"

We could live out by the sea
Oh, like they do on the movie screen
Oh, marry me, Mary May
Before you off and fly away"
So much time has passed since that day
Mary stopped writing years ago
And Bobby never took his music on the road
Guess he never really gave up hope
Now Mary she's got everything she thought she wanted
Got a PhD, she is an independent business woman
Climbing up the corporate ladder
Though it really don't seem to matter
She is lonely beyond belief
So one day she went home
Looking for the only love she'd ever known
She found him once again
Playing a circuit at a Holiday Inn
Still singing a song about the one gone long ago
Just goes to show you never know
She took his hand in hers
Got everything she had planned and rehearsed
She said, "Bobby, marry me
We could live in a apartment building with a window view
We could take in movies on the weekend
While we're planning our vacation
Take a honeymoon by the sea
Oh Bobby, won't you just marry me?
Won't you just marry me?
Oh please, marry me"
It was a fine day in the fifth grade
