Turns 21 on new years eve
Everytime i see her she clings to me
Cause thats what young girls do
Shes fire on her own she knows me well
Never gets mad at the storys i tell
Shes an old soul living in a cheap motel
Travelin to by sea
I been up and i been down
And i been away and i been around
And i been mopin all around this town
Waiting for loretta too long
Well i knew a girl
I knew her family too
And theyd all try to skin me if they only knew
But it only happened for a time or two
I couldn't hold her all through the storm
Well shes a comfort in the rain
Shes a walk in the park
Shes cold in the day
Cool when its dark
And i came outside and she was standing on my car
She don't like it when i tell her no
Well i been up and i been down
I been away and i been around
And i been mopin all around this
Waitin for loretta too long
Well i met a girl she liked the way i smelled
Thought it was a little bit weird but i thought what the hell
So we road all around til the morning fell
I liked her freckles in the sunrise
So i saw her again but it wasn't too long
Before she asked me to sing her a loretta song
And thats about the time everything went wrong
I never saw or heard from her again
Cause she knew better than that
And she knew better than me
And she could see all the things i couldn't yet see
And she told me id get it eventually
I'm still looking i guess
So i been up and i been down
And i been away and i been around
And i been mopin all around this town
