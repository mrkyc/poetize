And I saw the strangest thing
Everyone was walking on water and dancing in the rain
Oh darlin' I got so jealous
Just wishin' you were here with me
And I saw the prettiest people
They were kissing in the street
They didn't care who was watching
In the middle of the street
Didn't care who was watching
Well I can see blue in the sky when it's raining
And I can see blue in the sky when it's raining
And I can see blue in the sky when it's raining
Raining on me and I'm waiting on you
Just sitting here watching the weather
And I can feel the air is getting colder
They say sometimes the sunshine of a party
She's the first one to go she doesnt give any warning
She just gets up and goes she doesnt give any warning
I can see blue in the sky when its raining
And I can see blue in the sky when its raining
And I can see blue in the sky when its raining
Raining on me and I'm waiting on you
Oh, no no no no
You might also likeOh what would you do if I showed up
Oh at your doorstep just ready to go
Would you send me away
Or would you come out and play
It's just a little bit of rain and I'm leaving today
It's just a little bit of rain and I'm leaving today
'Cause I can see blue in the sky when its raining
And I can see blue in the sky when its raining
And I can see blue in the sky when its raining
Raining on me and I'm waiting on you
Oh I can see blue in the sky when it's raining
Oh I can see blue in the sky when it's raining
Oh I can see blue in the sky when it's raining
Raining on me and I'm waiting on you
Oh I can see you, no I can see you
Oh I can see you, no I can see you
Oh I can see you, no I can see you
Oh I can see you you you you
And I can see blue in the sky when it's raining
And I can see blue in the sky when it's raining
And I can see you in my eyes when it's raining
