Pulled up in a rose pink cadillac
He was singin' with the top down girl from the north
Dylan and Johnny Cash
He won the car on a card game listenin' to The Boss
He keeps his clothes in a gunney sack
She said, "Tell you what sailor, if you take me outta here
I'll do anything that you ask
Cause I don't wanna die like the people down here
But I feel that I'm fading fast."
He looked over to her chestnut hair
He said "I don't believe in love."
But he knew good and well she was the only girl there
So he figured it was close enough
And they hopped in the car, rolled the windows down far
And they headed through the desert plains
And she didn't even mind when they crossed the state line
And the sky opened up with rain
And they went three states 'fore they even spoke a word
He leaned over just to ask her name
She said, "Take me to the 61 highway, sailor
And you can call me Queen Jane
Cause the only thing I stole from the town
Was a crown that I took from a beauty queen."

Knew that she was just as cold as him
So he went to the trunk, grabbed the pistol from inside
And told Janey of his plan
And they went to the store she put the gas in the car
He came out running with a case of beer
And he jumped in the back with the money in the sack
And Janey she took the wheel
And they ran off in a blaze in a sweet summer haze
To the bullets of the cashier
"You keep your head down sailor
Cause I might need ya' later, just holler if you can hear
Cause I'm gonna need a man
Not a farmer girl tan and a cadillac souvenir."
And they camped out by the railroad bridge
And they made love all night
Watched the sun come up over Mercury Ridge
From a hilltop outta sight
They hit five more banks and their small-town safes
And they knew that they could get out fast
Had the time of their life but they had to have a talk
Cause they knew that it couldn't last
They made friends with the man at the Mexico border
And they left him with a bag of cash
She said, "I tell you what, sailor
I don't care about that paper
But I'm happy that we passed
Cause I'm feeling pretty tired
And I'm carrying a child and we both need a rest."
And they settled down to a house near the water
Where they would live to be old and gray
And many years later the kids are all older
