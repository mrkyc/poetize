'Cause I am one of you
I was born on a dirt road
Out in the country
And I wanted for nothing
No trouble did I see
So do not pretend
That you understand
All the troubles that others been through
Don't point your fingers and so freely judge all the ones
Who ain't as privileged as you
If you never had to fight for your life or your family
If you never had to live on the streets all alone
If you've never been harassed by the ones who should protect you
If you've never been mistreated for the colour of your skin
Then listen all your children of privilege
'Cause I am one of you
I had a good mother and I had a good father
And together they showed me respect for all people
Regardless of class and
Regardless of background
Regardless of race
No matter their religion or
Their preference of partner
'Cause every human being will have their own story as
Important as the other who walks right beside or
Across their own city
Across this great country
Across the blue water to lands far and wide
Well I ain't saying that I can equip you
I ain't saying I ain't already fought
I am just trying to have more compassion
To lead by example and to
Turn from my temper not to
Add to the anger not to
Give in to violence and
'Cause great divide between me and my neighbour
Between me and my brother
Between me and my sister
There's too many suffering and
There's too many dying in this
World without reasons in this
World without reason in this
World without reason
So don't turn tour back on the ones with less fortune
The ones with less privilege that could have been you
With a slight twist of fate if they were born lucky or
Born into money or
Born with white skin
Well I'll tell you plainly what I'm trying to do
I'm just trying to be better
Changing my own life
And look towards the future
And find understanding
So that I might inspire you to
Look at your own life and
Think for yourself
So listen all you children of privilege
