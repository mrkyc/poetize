And Charlie, is barkin'
Then the rain came, on a calm dawn
And we slept, through the morning
And you said, sometimes, I wish the sun didn't come out at all
Yeah you said, sometimes, I wish the sun didn't come out at all
Just the good days
Just the good days
Oh yeah and later on, we took a southbound train
Yeah and it was cold out, yeah it was freezing down rain
Yeah and it'll let up, if we all screamed for the change
Yeah but you just stood there, and you started to shake
Then you said, sometimes, I wish the sun didn't come out at all
Yeah you said, sometimes, I wish the sun didn't come out at all
No, no just the good days
No, no just the good days
Yeah, yeah just the good days
Yeah, yeah, yeah just the good days
You lit a cigarette
And you got out of bed
And you stood on the balcony there with your feet wet
I begged you to come in, out of the cold night
You said it ain't the dark that I'm afraid of, it's the light
Said it ain't the dark that I'm afraid of, it's the light
Said it ain't the dark that I'm afraid of, it's the light
Said it ain't the dark that I'm afraid of, it's the light
