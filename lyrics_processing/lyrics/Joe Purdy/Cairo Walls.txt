I am a friend
Blood runs the same as you
I love my country
But my country has sinned
Changes are overdue
So don't turn your back on millions of people
Just trying to tell you what's wrong
This land is your land
This land is my land
This land has been bleedin' too long
And my brother was chased by the white hats
And my brother was only nineteen
And my brother was shot by a sniper
And my brother he died in the street
And my brother was beat by policeman
And he died on a prison floor
And my brother he fought in Vietnam
And my brother was killed coming home from the war
And my brother was killed in his hometown
We wear the stars and stripes
And they're painted in the heart of the country
We saw America die
It was written on the Cairo Walls
You might also likeAnd my sister was gassed at the protest
And my sister was told not to speak up
And my sister was taken in handcuffs
And my sister was moved to the back of the bus
She was told not to eat in your restaurants
She was told not to swim in your swimming pools
She was told not to work in your factories
She was told not to vote in your elections
She was told that she was worth nothing
We watched the railroad wind
Through the broken heart of the country
We saw America die
It was written on the Cairo Walls
And my brother he marched down on Washington
And my brother he inspired millions
And my brother he spoke for equality
And my brother was shot on a balcony
And my brother was shot at the theater
And my brother was shot from a grassy knoll
And my brother was shot in a stairwell
And my brother was shot in a doorway
And my brother was shot in a church house
And my brother was killed in a chokehold
And my brother was shot in Chicago
And my brother was shot down in Ferguson
And my brother was shot with his hands up
And my brother was shot with his hands up
We wear the stars and stripes
And they're painted in the heart of the country
We saw America die
