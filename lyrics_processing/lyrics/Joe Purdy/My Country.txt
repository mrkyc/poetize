My country is wide
My country's gold
And the crops that grow high
Where the wild flowers bloom
And the rivers run wild
My country's tall
My country is wide
Oh I've seen red tails fly up to the mount
Skies so big can't figure it out
Deserts so red and the canyons so deep
Water so clear
And the valleys so green
I've seen migrant workers
Up from Mexico way
They're picking down oranges a few dollars a day
To send back to their children
So they may survive
Hoping someday for American lives
Cause my country's rich
My country is strong
Driving fine cars
Up to tract homes
We're tearing down buildings
And takin' back loans
My country is rich
My country is strong
You might also likeI've heard the fireworks
On the Fourth of July
Well I've seen little bighorn
Of the Indian's right
Forced on reservations
And stripped of their ways
They'll try to fight back
And we lock them away
'Cause we wave the red
And the white and the blue
But there's people so troubled
They hardly get through
If your family was starving
And you couldn't feed one
Would you reconsider my friends
What had to be done
Well temperature is rising
So the scientists say
That hole's getting bigger
With each passing day
And mad mother nature
And a damaging winds
And a raging flood waters
'Til the levies cave in
Still I will defend her
Up to my dying breath
But when I charge blindly
Towards every new threat
With false information
Like we've done before
Leads to dead soldiers
And orphans of war
Well my biggest fear
Is that it will all end
Let the missiles start flying
And the nukes'll come in
With nothing left over
No hope to live on
And that war is over
My country is gone
So listen my brothers
And my sisters alike
Stop fighting your neighbors
Stop taking up sides
Learn to love one another
Before its too late
Start working together
