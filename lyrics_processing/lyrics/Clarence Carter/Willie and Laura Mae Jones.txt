Were our neighbors a long time back
They lived right down the road from us
In a shack just like our shack
We worked in the fields together
And we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land
You don't have the time to think about another man's color
They sit out on the front porch
In the evening when the sun went down
Willie would play and Laura would sing
And the children would dance around
I'd bring 'em out my guitar
And we'd play into the night
And every now and then, ol' Willie would grin and say
"Boy, you play all right"
Ha, ha, ha
The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine
But that was another place and another time
Yeah, the cotton was high and the corn was growing fine
Aha, but that was another place and another time
I remember when Willie would hitch the mules up
When Sandy rolled around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
"Hey, y'all want something from town?"
He'd say no, but why don't y'all stop back on your way home
I'll get Laura Mae to cook up some corn bone
They good, y'all

But that was another place and another time
Now, the years rolled by at last
And took back what they had given
We all knew we had to move
If I was gonna make a living
So we all moved off
And went our separate ways
And it sure was hard to say goodbye
To Willie and Laura Mae (Jones, y'all)
The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine
But that was another place and another time
Yeah, the cotton was high and the corn was growing fine
Aha, but that was another place and another time
The years rolled passed our door and we heard from them no more
'Til I saw Willie downtown the other day
I said, "Y'all stop by tonight, we can sit down and eat a bite
We'd love to see your children and Laura Mae"
He shook his head real slow
And spoke with his eyes so kind
He said this is another place and another time
The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine
Aha, but that was another place and another time
Yeah, the cotton was high and the corn was growing fine
Aha, but that was another place and another time
Yeah
The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine
Uh-huh, but that was another place and another time
