'Cause Grandpa had given me some news and I had to think
The bartender said "Have a drink of gin, 'cause drinkin' gin ain't no sin"
But I told the bartender that drinkin' gin won't let your nature bend
Grandpa can't fly his kite
'Cause Grandma won't give it no tail, no
So you see, I've got to use what Mother Nature gave me
Before Father Time takes it away, yeah
The mother rabbit told the father rabbit
She said "Sex ain't nothin' but a habit"
The father rabbit told the mother rabbit
"Well, baby, shoot the habit to me rabbit"
The male bee makes love to the queen bee
Until she cries
He knows when he finishes makin' love
He's surely gonna die
But you see, Grandpa can't fly his kite
'Cause Grandma won't give it no tail, no
So I'm gonna use what Mother Nature gave me
Before Father Time takes it away, yeah
I told you, I got sixteen inches
And it's four inches thick
And the first day I don't make love
I'll take gravely sick
You might also likeI feel sorry for Grandpa
Because I know what he wants to do
And that's how come I came over to your house
Because I got to make love to you
You see, Grandpa can't fly his kite
'Cause Grandma won't give no tail, no, shake it
So I got to use what Mother Nature gave me
Before Father Time takes it away, yeah
(Instrumental Break)
I went to see my doctor, just the other day
He said, "Clar, you won't last too long if you don't slow down the pace"
I said, "Listen, doctor, good lovin' ain't no sin
But if that good stuff kill me, then let me go with the breeze"
Grandpa can't fly his kite
'Cause Grandma won't give no tail, no
So I got to use what Mother Nature gave me
Before Father Time takes it away, yeah
One more verse...
Grandpa and Grandma were layin' in the bed
And Grandpa turned over, and this is what he said
He said, "Wake up Grandma, don't sleep so damned sound
'Cause that ain't what you promised when we first laid down"
Grandpa can't fly his kite
'Cause Grandma won't give no tail, yeah, yeah,yeah
So I got to use what Mother Nature gave me
