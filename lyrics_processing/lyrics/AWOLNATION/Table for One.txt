Look at the pavement
Our initials barely fit
I used an old nail
While you kept the night lit

See, I don't like this
I think I might just
Kick the dramatics
So watch out

'Cause I don't want you to leave
I want a day in your dreams
And with a little luck, you can stay
(A little luck, you can stay, a little luck, you can stay)
'Cause I don't want you to leave

Now I'm sitting at a table for one
Now I'm sitting at a table for one

Hey, why the long face?
You little night owl
I'm just an early riser
Still you woke up with that face, wow
You might also like
See, I don't like this
I think I might flip
Kick the dramatics
So watch out

'Cause I don't want you to leave
I want a day in your dreams
And with a little luck, you can stay
(A little luck, you can stay, a little luck, you can stay)
'Cause I don't want you to leave

Now I'm sitting at a table for one
Now I'm sitting at a table for one

Blue summer blood, blue summer love
Blue summer, don't take me
Blue summer blood, blue summer love
Blue summer, don't take me
Blue summer blood, blue summer love
Blue summer, don't take me
Blue summer blood, blue summer love
Blue summer, don't take me
'Cause I don't want you to leave
('Cause I don't want you to leave, 'cause I don't want you to leave)
I want a day in your dreams
(I want a day in your dreams, I want a day in your dreams)
And with a little luck, you can stay
(A little luck, you can stay, a little luck, you can stay)
'Cause I don't want you to leave
('Cause I don't want you to, 'cause I don't want you to leave)

Now I'm sitting at a table for one
(Blue summer blood, blue summer love)
(Blue summer, don't take me)
(Blue summer blood, blue summer love)
