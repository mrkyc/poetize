Sail
Sail

This is how I show my love
I made it in my mind because
I blame it on my A.D.D. baby
This is how an angel cries
I blame it on my own sick pride
Blame it on my A.D.D. baby

Sail, sail, sail, sail, sail, sail, sail, sail

Uh huh, Kendrick Lamar (Sail)
I look in the mirror and nothing's familiar I stare
I look in the mirror and nothing's familiar I dare
For you to say that you're familiar with character which this I have
Mental is riding a big yellow cab
Telling the driver to press on the gas
Yell at them until I get there
You could just love me and leave me alone
I'm warning you though if you love me you never go wrong
We can explore heavy feelings of breathing mother nature's air
Feelings of knowing I'm rather rare
But there's a reason for all of my madness the gladness I am that you're here
You might also like
Sail, sail, sail, sail, sail

This is how I show my love
Let my soul sail before I'm washed up
Gotta drop down thank God above that I'm high enough to give the sky a touch (uh)
Maybe it's my A.D.D. I'm on the move like a real estate agency
Century 21, 21st Century bare the birth of my history there can only be one (uh)
This how I show my love
Let my soul sail like Miss Aiko
Sacrifice my life just to free the people the Jesus sequel (uh)
So many admire us 'cause they can't see through our iris's
I got an eye for her, I got an eye for her, I got three eyes
I need three brides

Sail, sail, sail, sail, sail

La la la la la la oh!
La la la la la la oh!
