These friends of mine will come and go
I'm the first to leave and last to know
I'll be swimmin' in a face of flames
For these friends of mine I've overpaid

And I guess I wanted, I guess I wanted
I just want you to know

All of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
And I am
Only lookin' up when my head's down
All of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
Maybe all of these things made me who I am
And I am
Only lookin' up when my head's down

Ooh, veins are glistening
So thanks a lot for listening (Aaahh)
