The night he met my mom
She asked him to play "I'll see you again"
That old Nole Cowell song
He told him he was conceded
He slung one back at her
He didn't mind that her singing wasn't good
When he got a good look at her
She learned that song when she was a kid
Lost her dad when she was young
Never got to say goodbye
Maybe that's why was her son, she sing
I'll see you again
Whenever spring breaks through again
Though the years my tears may dry
I shall love you 'til I die, goodbye
I'm out in California, I'm driving a dead meat
His crying, he thought I was the first to go
How could this happen to me?
And said she told me never to bring him here
'Cause we drive up to that home
People go to die but she keeps hanging on
My dad looks down at the floor as he holds on to her hand
She says to me how could he leave me here?
No, he never went there again
You might also likeI'll see you again
Whenever spring breaks through again
Though the years my tears may dry
I shall love you 'til I die, goodbye
One year later in my brother's house
My dad's in his dying bed
As if she's already dead and gone
Not a word about her is said
Later that day I visit her
My brother comes along
She thinks she's home with my dad
Can't remember he's ever gone
My brother picks up his guitar
He's saying I'll see you again
My mom remembers all the words
Right down to the end
I'll see you again
Whenever spring breaks through again
Though the years my tears my dry
I shall love you 'til I die, goodbye, goodbye
Four years later I hold her hand
She's asleep, just soon be gone
I don't know if she can hear me
But I sing for her that song
And I tell her my goodbyes
