You're open like a book and the pages get filled
The leaves keep turning and on every single page
They write their story with the marks on your face
Marks on your face
Locked in your head an unbreakable code
A secret never spoken is a story never told
Gonna show you the back of my hand they say
You can hide those scars but they hurt you every day
They hurt you every day
They hurt you every day

What was written on the back of his hand
You once said it out loud you won't say it again
What was written on the back of his hand
You once said it out loud you won't say it again
What was written on the back of his hand
You won't say it again
Water is holy when it falls from the sky
Water tastes bitter when it falls from your eyes
Lay down on the ground and look up at the sky
There's no rhyme or reason when you're watching time fly
Watching time fly

Connect those stars with the lines of your life
With the lines on your hand with the words that you write
One true word's gonna beat a pack of lies
Beat a pack of lies
Beat a pack of lies
