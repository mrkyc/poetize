You stand in front of the band
With all those scarves in your hands
I see you play your imaginary guitars
You people shaking your heads
Right till the end of the set
You really turn me on wherever we are
Can't live, can't live without you
Can't live, can't live without you
Can't live, can't live without you
Can't live, can't live without you
Put your hands in the air
So I can see you are there
I wanna see all your lights shining on
Want you to stand up and dance
Gonna leave you no chance
To take a breath between each single song
Can't live, can't live without you
Can't live, can't live without you
Can't live, can't live without you
Can't live, can't live without you
