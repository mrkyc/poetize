Everybody wants to fall in love
Nobody wanna deal when it gets tough
Always looking for the next best thing
Head over heels for a six week fling
Whatcha you gonna do when you find the one?

You can fall if you want, if it's what you're wishing
You can trip up in love, baby I'm not trippin'
You can run around town but that's not my vision
Never too much to work it out
We be going higher, gonna rise up the love
You and I we going higher
Gonna rise up the love

I never said it would be easy
Believe me, it takes two
If you wonder where I'm walking, it's towards you
'Cause when you really, really, love somebody
You ain't gotta listen to nobody
You should never, never give up easy
I won't stand for history repeating

You can fall if you want, if it's what you're wishing
You can trip up in love, baby I'm not trippin'
You can run around town but that's not my vision
Never too much to work it out
We be going higher, gonna rise up the love
You and I we're going higher
Gonna rise up the love
You can fall if you want, if is what you're wishing
You can trip up in love, baby I'm not trippin'
You can run around town but that's not my wish
Never too much to work it out
You might also like
When you really, really love somebody
You ain't gotta listen to nobody
Baby, anywhere you go I'll follow
Fill you up never leave you hollow
I don't need to see what else is out there
Everything I want is right here

You can fall if you want, if it's what you're wishing
You can trip over love, baby I'm not trippin'
You can run around town but that's not my vision
Never too much to work it out
We be going higher, gonna rise up the love
You and I we're going higher
Gonna rise up the love
You can fall if you want, if it's what you're wishing
You can trip over love, baby I'm not trippin'
You can run around town but that's not my vision
Never too much to work it out
Yeah, we're going higher, gonna rise up the love
You and I we're going higher
