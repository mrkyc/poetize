I was cool already
Way before you met me
In my Timbs and my Happy socks
And I know how to get 'em off, yeah
See my skies are sunny
Got a pocket full of money
And maybe there's not a lot
But damn, I'm in a good spot

I got nothing to hide
You're not playing this right
You want some advice?

Boy, don't be killing my
Boy, don't be killing my vibe
My vibe, oh, my vibe
Boy, don't be killing my
Boy, don't be killing my vibe
My vibe, my vibe
Boy, don't be killing my
You just be killing it

Rock your body, rock it steady
Love me, baby, I'm so ready
Wanna get lucky tonight
Boy, don't be killing my
Boy, don't be killing my vibe

Pla-player, I'm a real soothsayer
There's a future with you and me
Upstairs, on my balcony
Yeah, got a good buzz going
And it feels good knowing
That my girls here got my back
Any guys gotta deal with that

I got nothing to hide
You're not playing this right
You want some advice?

Boy, don't be killing my
Boy, don't be killing my vibe
My vibe, oh, my vibe
Boy, don't be killing my
Boy, don't be killing my vibe
My vibe, my vibe
Boy, don't be killing my
You just be killing it

Rock your body, rock it steady
Love me, baby, I'm so ready
Wanna get lucky tonight
Boy, don't be killing my
Boy, don't be killing my vibe
I think I want, want, want, want, want, want what you got
You're the one, one, one, one, one who's got the shot
And now you don't go blowing it, talking about your heart
Don't be so serious
Boy, don't be killing my
Boy, don't be killing my vibe

Rock your body, rock it steady
Love me, baby, I'm so ready
Wanna get lucky tonight
Boy, don't be killing my
Boy, don't be killing my vibe
Boy, don't be killing my
You just be killing it
Rock your body, rock it steady
Love me, baby, I'm so ready
Wanna get lucky tonight
Boy, don't be killing my
You just be killing my vibe
Rock your body, rock it steady
Love me, baby, I'm so ready
Wanna get lucky tonight
Boy, don't be killing my
