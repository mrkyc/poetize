You got what you wanted
Didn't you?
Don't know where your heart is
But mine's bruised
You knew when you started
That I'd lose
The blood on the carpet
Is not you

I tried to wash the scars and marks from under my skin
But you're etched in me like stone

You can't save me (yeah, yeah)
You call it love, but still you hate me? (yeah, yeah)
Lord I try and I can't say no
You're the pain and the medicine
One taste and I'm numb again
You can't save me (yeah, yeah)
Lord I try and I can't say no

Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Ain't nothing I can do to save my soul
Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
You might also like
A moth to a candle
That's me to you
I was never this fragile
Or consumed
I'm covered in shrapnel
Through and through
And I wish I knew how to
Hate you

I try to wash the scars and marks from under my skin
But you're etched in me like stone

You can't save me (yeah, yeah)
You call it love, but still you hate me? (yeah, yeah)
Lord I try and I can't say no
You're the pain and the medicine
One taste and I'm numb again
You can't save me (yeah, yeah)
Lord I try and I can't say no

Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Ain't nothing I can do to save my soul
Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
You've got your chains wrapped around me so tight
Give me enough just to keep me alive
I try to run but it hurts every time, I try
Lord I try and I can't say no
(Oh Lord)
Lord I try and I can't say no

Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Ain't nothing I can do to save my soul
Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Oh lord, na, na, na, na, na, yeah

You got what you wanted
