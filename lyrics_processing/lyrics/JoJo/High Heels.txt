Now, you don't know what you don't have 'til it's gone
Looked through your phone like I should have all along

You've been a bad muthafucka
These pictures of these bitches I don't know
I'm goin' out and never, ever coming home

I put my high heels on, walk right out the door
Best believe I'ma leave, don't need you no more
Put my black dress on, boy, you done me wrong
Leave the keys, burn the sheets and then move along
I'ma look damn good for all of your friends
Don't cry when you see me again
I put my high heels on

Now you don't know, what you don't have
'Til it's walking in some red stilettos, talking to some handsome devils
Jealous? Well, you should be
It's a feeling I know all too well
Our chance at heaven, shot to hell

You bad muthafucka
These pictures of these bitches, oh no no
Without me, boy, you'll always feel alone
You might also like
I put my high heels on, walk right out the door
Best believe I'ma leave, don't need you no more
Put my black dress on, boy, you done me wrong
Leave the keys, burn the sheets and then move along
I'ma look damn good for all of your friends
Don't cry when you see me again
I put my high heels on, walk right out the door
Best believe I'ma leave, don't need you no more

Now, you don't know what you don't have
No, you don't know what you don't have until it's gone

I put my high heels on, walk right out the door
Best believe I'ma leave, don't need you no more
Put my black dress on, boy, you done me wrong
Leave the keys, burn the sheets and then move along
I'ma look damn good for all of your friends
Don't cry when you see me again
I put my high heels on, walk right out the door
Best believe I'ma leave, don't need you no more
Put my black dress on, boy, you done me wrong
Leave the keys, burn the sheets and then move along
I'ma look damn good for all of your friends
Don't cry when you see me again
