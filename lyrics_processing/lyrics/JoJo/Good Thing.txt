I don't know nobody who gets me up the way you do
I don't need no pill with what you do to me
Oh baby that's the way I feel
Like a million dollar bill
See it on my face that we're in ecstasy

Oh, you're an escape from everything I've ever known
Oh, I feel you close you give me something to call my own

You give me that good thing
Nobody can compare
You give me that good thing
Only you take me there
You give me that good thing
Can't nobody do it better
I know you're the real thing, good thing
You give me that good thing
Nobody can compare
You give me that good thing
Only you take me there
You give me that good thing
Can't nobody do it better
I know you're the real thing, good thing
You might also like
See, I don't know nobody who gets me up the way you do
You're the perfect high I don't wanna come down
I don't need no good advice telling me what's wrong or right
There's no explanation for the love we've found

Oh, you're an escape from everything I've ever known
Oh, I feel you close you give me something to call my own

You give me that good thing
Nobody can compare
You give me that good thing
Only you take me there
You give me that good thing
Can't nobody do it better
I know you're the real thing, good thing
You give me that good thing
Nobody can compare
You give me that good thing
Only you take me there
You give me that good thing
Can't nobody do it better
I know you're the real thing, good thing
Oh, there's a riot in me ready to explode
This attraction's deeper than they'll ever know
You give me that, you give me that, oh
Flashing lights already got me in the zone
It's a feeling that I never wanna go
You give me that good hit, that real shit
No counterfeit, that good thing
(You give me that good thing)
You give me that good thing
Can't nobody do it better
I know you're the real thing, good thing

You give me that good thing
Nobody can compare
You give me that good thing
Only you take me there
You give me that good thing
Can't nobody do it better
