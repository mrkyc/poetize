Trees lose their leaves to the snow
Words cut like ice as you go
No amount of covers could keep me warm
And I've been freezing since the day you walked away

All you ever wanted was a free ride
All I ever wanted was your love
You gave it all away to start a new life
I guess what I could give wasn't enough

You left me cold, cold, co-o-o-old
You left me cold, cold, co-o-o-old
You left me cold, cold, co-o-o-old
You left me cold, cold, co-o-o-old
You left me

Why do we have to call it the night shift?
Why do we have to hide all of our vices?
You just don't like it when I'm this open
I'm not crazy, this isn't a crisis

I'm just tryna figure out if I'm in love
It's not promiscuous, it's just owning it
You need to let go of what a good girl does
It's not that obvious, it's my prerogative

It might not be what you wanted
But at least I'm honest
But at least I'm honest
It might not be how you thought it
But I'm not that heartless
At least I'm honest
It might not be what you wanted
But at least I'm honest
At least I'm honest
It might not be what you wanted
But at least I'm honest
At least I'm honest
You wanna call me names
When I do what I do but you're doing the fuckin' same
So don't look at me that way, like you thought I was a saint
If I tell you the truth, then there's nothing else to explain

I'm just tryna figure out if I'm in love
It's not promiscuous, it's just owning it
You need to let go of what a good girl does
It's not that obvious, it's my prerogative

It might not be what you wanted
But at least I'm honest
But at least I'm honest
It might not be how you thought it
But I'm not that heartless
At least I'm honest
It might not be what you wanted
But at least I'm honest
Yeah, at least I'm honest
It might not be what you wanted
But at least I'm honest
Yeah, at least I'm honest
Away, oh whoa, oh
Away, oh whoa, oh
Away, oh whoa, oh
Away, oh whoa, oh

Don't want you to be disheartened
Tryna do the right thing
Tell you the truth 'bout how I'm feeling
That's gotta mean somethin'

It might not be what you wanted
But at least I'm honest
But at least I'm honest
It might not be what you wanted
But at least I'm honest
At least I'm honest
It might not be what you wanted
(It might not be what you wanted)
But at least I'm honest
(But at least I'm always honest)
But at least I'm honest
It might not be what you wanted
(It might not be what you wanted)
But at least I'm honest
(But at least I'm always honest)
But at least I'm honest

Away, oh whoa, oh
