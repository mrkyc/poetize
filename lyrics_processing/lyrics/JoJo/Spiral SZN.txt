Oh-oh

Lover girl, lovin' everything but herself
Pedestals for everyone, but she's on a shelf
Emotion comatose
You know how that shit goes, yeah
Lover girl, loves to overthink it to death
Underwhelmed by everything that she's ever did
Full cups are half empty
That's how I see it

Ooh-ah, usually people compliment my positivity
But my sanity ain't always there for me
It's like that when you're your biggest enemy
Guess I'm havin'

Ice in my Sauvignon, I'm havin' one of those nights
Where I need it right now, you know that I can't chill (Oh)
Never could, probably never will
I, I could do somethin' nice for myself, but I don't
I keep on startin' fights with myself, all downhill
Postpone the healin', it's
Spiral season again, yeah

Here comes the rain and the drama (Oh no)
My pain sits next to the trauma
No room for nothin' else
I know this season all too well (Yeah, yeah)

Usually people compliment my sensitivity
But my sanity ain't always there for me
It's like that when you're your biggest enemy (Ooh)
Guess I'm havin'

Ice in my Sauvignon, I'm havin' one of those nights
Where I need it right now, you know that I can't chill (Oh)
Never could, probably never will
I, I could do somethin' nice for myself, but I don't
I keep on startin' fights with myself, all downhill (And it's all downhill)
Postpone the healin', it's
Spiral season again, yeah
