You know, love is just one of those things
You can't really explain, it's insane

Lay here with me in the dark
I know my edges are sharp
But sometimes the pain is what hurts you so good
When you took a knife to my heart
And cut out the rational parts
I knew that you were just misunderstood

Cause you give me mad love
How far can we go? Nobody knows
You give me bad love
But I'll take what I get, I'm starvin' for it
Like I've never had love
You keep me insane, I'm not ashamed
Don't-give-a-damn love
I want you so bad love

You give me mad love, mad love
Mad love, mad love
You might also like
Twisted like wire in your arms
A dangerous place for my heart
But you know I love getting off on the thrill
You turn me from water to wine
I'm wasted all of the time
So do it, baby, go in for the kill

You give me mad love
How far can we go? Nobody knows
You give me bad love
But I'll take what I get, I'm starvin' for it
Like I've never had love
You keep me insane and I'm not ashamed
Don't-give-a-damn love
I want you so bad, love
You give me

You give me mad love
How far can we go? Nobody knows
You give me bad love
But I'll take what I get, I'm starvin' for it
I've never had love
You keep me insane and I'm not ashamed
Don't-give-a-damn love
I want you so bad, yeah
You made me mad love
You keep me insane and I'm not ashamed
Don't-give-a-damn love
Cause I want you so, cause I want you so
You give me mad love
How far can we go? Nobody knows
You give me mad love
Mad love, mad love
