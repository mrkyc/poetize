Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down

He told me that he like this, he like this
He wanna take his time with me, like this
Let me show you how I wind it, like this
Let me show you like, like, show you like, like
Take your body downtown, but right round
Like you better with the lights down, but way down
Higher than the ceiling, hotter than the sun
You want some of me? Baby, come get some, l-l-l-like

Rap game flow on the radio
Two bad ones with me, we ain't goin' home
I'm a good girl, baby, tell me what you want
What you want, what you want

Got ya blood flow pumpin' like this
Got you so spaced out, floatin' on the mids
Get you in my backroom in a little bit
Just give me a minute, I know you with it
You might also like
He told me that he like this, he like this
He wanna take his time with me, like this
Let me show you how I wind it, like this
Let me show you like, like, show you like, like
Take your body downtown, but right round
Like you better with the lights down, but way down
Higher than the ceiling, hotter than the sun
You want some of me? Baby, come get some, l-l-l-like

Can't keep my name off your lips
Just like your eyes don't move off my hips
You're the thunder, thunder, crackin' like a whip
Don't resist, just admit

I got your blood flow pumpin' like this
So spaced out, floatin' on the mids
Ready, set, go all the way, don't quit
Just come get it, I know you with it

He told me that he like this, he like this
He wanna take his time with me, like this
Let me show you how I wind it, like this
Let me show you like, like, show you like, like
Take your body downtown, but right round
Like you better with the lights down, but way down
Higher than the ceiling, hotter than the sun
You want some of me? Baby, come get some, l-l-l-like
This, this, this, this, this, this, this, this
Like this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this
Like this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this
Like this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this (ooh yeah)

He told me that he like this, he like this
