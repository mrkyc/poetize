Apparently there's been a lunar eclipse
Don't know what that means but I sure feel it
Everything's been heightened by your service
And I deserve it
I bring all the realness to the surface
Does a woman like that make you nervous?
I'll take you to church and watch you worship
Watch you work it

One by one we'll be switching it up
Like it's Everlast
Go in, round two when the skies turning blue
When we finally crash

No, I don't care where we stand, man
Hundred and one night stands
Or, full time lovers
Ay, listen, I got enough friends, man
Tell me "no matter what happens
We're full time lovers"
If you wanna come eat edibles
Do some freaky shit, incredible
I'm your girl, I'm your girl
But listen, I got enough friends, man
Tell me "no matter what happens
We're full time lovers"
You might also like
Damn, you got my foot prints on the ceiling
On the mirror, on the headboard, in the bathroom
On the marble floor
Does somebody's cookie got you leaning?
Got you fiending?

One by one we'll be switching it up
Like it's Everlast
Go in, round two when the skies turning blue
When we finally crash

No, I don't care where we stand, man
Hundred and one night stands
Or, full time lovers
Ay listen,  I got enough friends, man
Tell me "no matter what happens
We're full time lovers"
If you wanna come eat edibles
Do some freaky shit incredible
I'm your girl, I'm your girl
But listen, I got enough friends, man
Tell me "no matter what happens
We're full time lovers"
Green candies melting us together
I feel higher up than Fenway Park
Is it your fingers giving tingles or this
Hydroponic daily spark?
Meet me in the dark
I need you here 10 PM sharp
Oh, yeah, yeah

No, I don't care where we stand, man
Hundred and one night stands
Or, full time lovers
Ay, listen, I got enough friends, man
Tell me "no matter what happens
We're full time lovers"
If you wanna come eat edibles
Do some freaky shit incredible
I'm your girl, I'm your girl
But listen, I got enough friends, man
Tell me "no matter what happens
We're full time lovers"

(Oooh, doo doo doo doo)
(Now that you know)
