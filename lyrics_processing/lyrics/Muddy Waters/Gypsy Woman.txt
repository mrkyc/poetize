You know the gypsy woman told me
That you your mother's bad-luck child
You know the gypsy woman told me
That you your mother's bad-luck child
Well, you're having a good time now
But that'll be trouble after while

Well, you know I went to a gypsy woman
To have my fortune told
Say, "You better go back home son
And peep through your, your key hole"

You know the gypsy woman told me
That you your mother's bad-luck child
Well, you're having a good time now
But that'll be trouble after while

Well, now, you know I went back home
I took the gypsy woman as she said
I peeped through my key hole
There was another man laying in my bed
You might also like
You know the gypsy woman told me
That you your mother's bad-luck child
Well, you're having a good time now
