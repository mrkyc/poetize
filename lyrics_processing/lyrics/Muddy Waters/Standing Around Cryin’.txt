Oh, baby, look how you got me standing around crying
Oh, baby, look how you got me standing around crying
I know I don't love you little girl
But you're always resting on my mind

Oh baby, I ain't gonna be ridin' ya around in my automobile
Oh baby, I ain't gonna be ridin' ya around in my automobile
You got so many men
That I'm afraid you may get me killed

Oh baby, you ain't nothin' like you used to be
Oh no, don't get me killed, honey
Oh baby, you ain't nothin' like you used to be
When I was deep in love with you little girl
