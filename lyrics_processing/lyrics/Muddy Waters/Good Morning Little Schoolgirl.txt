Good morning, little schoolgirl
Good morning, little schoolgirl
Can I go home with
Can I go home with you?
Tell your mother and your father
I once was a schoolboy too

Sometime I don't know what
Sometime I don't know what
Woman, what in this world to
Woman, what in this world to do?
I don't want to hurt your feelings
Or even get mad with you

I'm gonna buy me an airplane
I'm gonna buy me an airplane
I'm gonna fly all over Chevy man
I'm gonna fly over Chevy man town
If I don't find my baby
Ain't gon' let my airplane down

Now who's that coming yonder?
Now who's that coming yonder?
She all dressed up and pretty
She all dressed up and pretty to me
And she don't be my baby
