I want to be close to you baby, as I can get
Close to you baby, as water is wet
Close to you baby, as hair on your head
Close to you babe, you better believe what I said

I want to be close to you, baby
Yeah, let me be close to you
I want to be close to you, darling
Till you don't know what to say or do

I want to be close to you baby, as white is to rice
Close to you baby, as cold is to ice
Close to you baby, as fire is to smoke
Close to you baby, as a pig is to poke


I said closer and closer, babe
Closer and closer, baby

I want to to be close to you, darling
Till you don't know what to say or do, yeah

I want to be close to you baby, as the whites of your eyes
Close to you baby, as cold is to ice
Close to you baby, as a egg is to a hen
Close to you baby, as Siamese twins
