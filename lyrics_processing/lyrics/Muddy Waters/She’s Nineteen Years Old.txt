I'm going to say something to you
I don't care how you feel
You just don't realize
You got yourself a good deal

She's nineteen years old
And got ways just like a baby child
Nothing I can do to please her
To make this young woman feel satisfied

I'm going to say this to you
I don't care if you get mad
You about the prettiest little girl
That I ever had

She's nineteen years old
And got ways just like a baby child
Nothing I can do to please her
To make this young woman feel satisfied
(What kind of woman is that?)

Can't ask her where she's going
She tells me where she's been
She starts a conversation
That don't have no end
You might also like
She's nineteen years old
And got ways just like a baby child
Nothing I can do to please her

Whoah, yeah!
