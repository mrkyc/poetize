Well, I wish I was a catfish swimming in a oh, deep, blue sea
I would have all you good looking women fishing, fishing after me
Sure enough, a-after me, sure enough, a-after me
Oh enough, oh enough, sure enough

Sure enough, he just now left, sure enough, he just now left
Oh enough, oh well, oh well

Well, my mother told my father just before hmmm, I was born
"I got a boy child's comin', gonna be, he's going to be a rolling stone"
Sure enough, he's a rolling stone, sure enough, he's a rolling stone
Oh well he's a, oh well he's a, oh well he's a


Well, I feel, yes I feel, feel that I could lay down oh, time isn't long
I'm gonna catch the first thing smoking back, back down the road, I'm going
Back down the road, I'm going, back down the road, I'm going
