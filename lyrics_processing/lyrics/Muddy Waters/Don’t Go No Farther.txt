You need meat, go to the market
You need bread, try the bakery
If you need love, baby
Don't go no further
Just come on home with me

I got to love somebody
I want somebody, to love me

You need grits, go to the grocery
You need fish, go to the sea
You need love, baby
Don't look no further
Just come on home with me


You need money, go to the bank dear
You need honey, look for the bees
You need love, baby
Don't go no further
Just come on home with me
You might also like

I got to love somebody
