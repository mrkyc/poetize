Well, I rolled and I tumbled
Cried the whole night long
Well, I rolled and I tumbled
Cried the whole night long
Well, I woke up this morning
Didn't know right from wrong

Well, I told my baby
Before I left that town
Well, I told my baby
Before I left that town
Well, don't you let nobody
Tear my barrelhouse down

Well, if the river was whiskey
And I was a diving duck
Well, if the river was whiskey
And I was a diving duck
Well, I would dive to the bottom
Never would I come up

Well, I could a had a religion
This bad old thing instead
Well, I could a had a religion
This bad old thing instead
Well, all whiskey and women
