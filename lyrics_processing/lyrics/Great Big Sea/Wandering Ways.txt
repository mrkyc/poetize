Farewell to the rum and occasional coke!
Farewell to the girls who came ready to play!
For this is the end of my wandering ways
Woke up one morning to the slam of a door
My lady had left me, she could take it no more!
The note on the table in black and white told:
My wandering ways had left her heart cold
We met last December while out on the tear
The laughter it flowed with the wine and the beer!
I promised her riches, I said I'd be true
She gave me a baby and the party was through
Farewell to the whiskey, tobacco and smoke!
Farewell to the rum and occasional coke!
Farewell to the girls who came ready to play!
For this is the end of my wandering ways
Now I miss my lady, I miss her so much!
The smell of her hair and her comforting touch
And I miss my boy and his ready smile!
They needed a man but I was a child
I hope this song finds her wherever she is!
And if you see her, would you tell her this?
For ramblin' and rovin' I don't give a damn!
The boy that she left has grown into a man
You might also likeFarewell to the whiskey, tobacco and smoke!
Farewell to the rum and occasional coke!
Farewell to the girls who came ready to play!
For this is the end of my wandering ways

There's lots to be said for being out on the tear
As luck would have it the very next year
I met her again and she'd seen how I'd grown!
Now we still go a ramblin, but we do it at home
Come all you young ramblers wherever you are
Beware of the ladies you meet at the bar!
The promise of pleasure can change your whole life
You walk in with a wallet and walk out with a wife!
Farewell to the whiskey, tobacco and smoke!
Farewell to the rum and occasional coke!
Farewell to the girls who came ready to play!
For this is the end of my wandering ways
Farewell to the whiskey, tobacco and smoke!
Farewell to the rum and occasional coke!
Farewell to the girls who came ready to play!
For this is the end of my wandering ways
