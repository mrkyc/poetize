After six months hard labor, at home I did arrive
I courted with a pretty girl, t'was her caused me to roam
Now I'm just a river driver and I'm far away from home
I'll eat when I am hungry and I'll drink when I am dry
Get drunk whenever I'm ready, get sober by and by
And if this river don't drown me, it's down I'll mean to roam
For I'm a river driver and I'm far away from home
I'll build a lonesome castle upon some mountain high
Where she can sit and view me as I go passing by
Where she can sit and view me as I go marching on
For I'm a river driver and I'm far away from home
I'll eat when I am hungry and I'll drink when I am dry
Get drunk whenever I'm ready, get sober by and by
And if this river don't drown me, it's down I'll mean to roam
For I'm a river driver and I'm far away from home
When I am old and feeble and in my sickness lie
Just wrap me up in a blanket and lay me down to die
Just get a little bluebird to sing for me alone
For I'm a river driver and I'm far away from home
I'll eat when I am hungry and I'll drink when I am dry
Get drunk whenever I'm ready, get sober by and by
And if this river don't drown me, it's down I'll mean to roam
For I'm a river driver and I'm far away from home
