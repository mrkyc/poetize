You'll just be getting up and I'll still be getting down
The band is getting tired but they don't give a damn
So blow the girls a kiss and give the boys a hand
You can take the sunshine, I can take the moonshine
You can take the high road, I can take the low
But later in the evening the one thing i believe is
I'm on the road to ruin it's the only way to go
A penny in my pocket, a bucket in the well
Then saturday was sunday and I could hear the bells
Deliver me from evil, forgiveness and for love
You're headin' for confession and I'm headin' to the pub
You can take the sunshine, I can take the moonshine
You can take the high road, I can take the low
But later in the evening the one thing i believe is
I'm on the road to ruin it's the only way to go
Nancy in the corner, now I'm movin' in
I thought I'd take me chances but I took one on the chin
I finally got her number, she wrote it on a cup
But I phoned her in the morning and I woke her mother up
She wished that I would go to bed, I only wished her well
And then she told me jesus said that I'd go straight to hell
She's followin' his footsteps, I'm followin' my nose
We're heading for the same place I'll see you down the road

You can take the high road, I can take the low
But later in the evening the one thing I believe is
We're on the road to ruin it's the only way to go
You can take the sunshine, I can take the moonshine
You can take the high road, I can take the low
But later in the evening the one thing I believe is
We're on the road to ruin it's the only way to go
