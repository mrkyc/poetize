She's already rigged to be bound for the ice
All you lads of the Southern we will have you to beware
She's going to the ice in the Spring of the year
Laddie whack fall the laddie, laddie whack fall the day
Our course be east-north-east for two days and two nights
Our captain he cried out "Boys, look ahead for the ice!"
He hove her about standing in for the land
And 'twas in a few hours we were firm in the jam
Laddie whack fall the laddie, laddie whack fall the day
Oh our captain he cried out, "Come on boys and lend a hand!"
Our cook he makes the breakfast and each man takes a dram
With their hats in their hands it was earlye for to go
Every man showed his action 'thout the missing of a blow
Laddie whack fall the laddie, laddie whack fall the day
Some were killing some were scalping, some were hauling on board
Some more they were firing and a-missing of their loads
In the dusk of the evening all hands in from the cold
And we counted nine hundred fine scalps in the hold

We will dance, sing, carouse, my boys, in just a little while
We will soon enjoy the charms of our sweethearts and friends
But it will not be long before we're down to the bend
Laddie whack fall the laddie, laddie whack fall the day
Oh, our schooner and our sloop in Ferryland they did lie
She's already rigged to be bound for the ice
All you lads of the Southern we will have you to beware
She's going to the ice in the Spring of the year
Laddie whack fall the laddie, laddie whack fall the day
Fall the laddie, laddie whack fall the day
