And ever since I lead a life of misery and woe
My wife she is a tyrant around the room and in
I should sell her to the devil for a glass or two of gin
Sure I'll get up and go to work as mild as any man
And she'll get up and dress herself and go and have her dram
I never chance to say a word it's well I know my due
She'll follow me with the fire n shovel up and down the room
And if the devil'd take her I'd thank him for his pain
I swear to God I'll hang meself if I get married again
And if the devil'd take her I'd thank him for his pain
Oh I swear to God I'll hang meself if I get married again
When I get up at breakfast time she'll tap me on the head
When I come home at dinner time I'll find her drunk in bed
When I come home at supper time with patience I must stop
Cause she drinks what's in the teapot and I must drink the slop
And if the devil'd take her I'd thank him for his pain
I swear to God I'll hang meself if I get married again
And if the devil'd take her I'd thank him for his pain
Oh I swear to God I'll hang meself if I get married again
Well once I asked me scoldin wife if I could go to bed
She scarce gave me an hour on the pillow to lay me head
When like a roarin lion she came bustin down to the door
She caught me by the middle an threw me naked on the floor

I swear to God I'll hang meself if I get married again
And if the devil'd take her I'd thank him for his pain
Oh I swear to God I'll hang meself if I get married again
Now me and my campanions go to a public place
She'll search around the neighbourhood until she finds my face
She'll hoist me up and ridicule before the company
Sayin "Petticoats is your master and forever more shall be"
And if the devil'd take her I'd thank him for his pain
I swear to God I'll hang meself if I get married again
And if the devil'd take her I'd thank him for his pain
Oh I swear to God I'll hang meself if I get married again
And if the devil'd take her I'd thank him for his pain
I swear to God I'll hang meself if I get married again
And if the devil'd take her I'd thank him for his pain
Oh I swear to God I'll hang meself if I get married again
And if the devil'd take her I'd thank him for his pain
I swear to God I'll hang meself if I get married again
And if the devil'd take her I'd thank him for his pain
