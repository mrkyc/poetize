Come all ye friends I'll sit ya down
And sing a doleful ditty
'Twas on a day in April month
We started from the city
We planned a day or two at Mahers
We stalwart men were chosen
To remove ol' Charlie from Angle Pond
Who fell in when the pond was frozen

We seven men came roaring down
On the road to Roaches Line
We might have stopped in Avondale or Brigus might have been fine
We was hungry as sin but we never stopped in
Nor took any time to park us
We all of us knew that we must get through to remove old Charlie's carcass

Here's to Charlie Horse, here's to Shave the Master
No better horse ne'er ran the course nor pulled the logs more faster
Here's to Charlie Horse and I wants ye all to know
Charlie's gone to the big corral where all good horses go

In the car was Noel Pocket Comb and beside him Old Moose Coosten
And Barracuda Bill and Jimmy Clark in the back seat he was roostin'
There was Smiley Stubborn o' the Mounted Police
It wasn't hard to find him
And Johnny Pollack and Sagebrush Sam was sitting right in beside him

Kevin and Buck was also there, for they brought some brawn and brains
They was aiming to help as best they could to remove old Chuck's remains
Charlie was like a brother to Shave, and he loved him well of course
Charlie was a very good man, you see, although he'd been a horse

Here's to Charlie Horse, here's to Shave the Master
No better horse ne'er ran the course nor pulled the logs more faster
Here's to Charlie Horse and I wants ye all to know
Charlie's gone to the big corral where all good horses go


Now I'll spare you all the gruesome details
And just relate the end
With two stout dories and a few strong ropes
We removed old Shady's friend
We gave him a decent send off with all our hats removed
So that on behalf of old Shave and his friend our loyalty was proved

Somewhere up in the great beyond his eyes are shining bright
Charlie nods an approving nod 'cause he knows we did him right
Shave will join him there one day and he'll bring the harness leather
And so on for all of eternity they'll pull the logs together
Here's to Charlie Horse, here's to Shave the Master
No better horse ne'er ran the course nor pulled the logs more faster
Here's to Charlie Horse and I wants ye all to know
Charlie's gone to the big corral where all good horses go

Oh, here's to Charlie Horse, here's to Shave the Master
No better horse ne'er ran the course nor pulled the logs more faster
Here's to Charlie Horse and I wants ye all to know
