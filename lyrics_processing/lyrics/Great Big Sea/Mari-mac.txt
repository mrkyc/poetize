Make no mistake, she's the girl I'm gonna track
Lots of other fellas try to get her on her back
But I'm thinking that they'll have to get up early
Mari Mac's mother's making Mari Mac marry me
My mother's making me marry Mari Mac
Well, I'm going to marry Mari for when Mari's taking care of me
We'll all be feeling merry when I marry Mari Mac
Hi diddly hi diddly hi diddle low
Now Mari and her mother are an awful lot together
In fact you hardly see the one without the other
And people often wonder if it's Mari or her mother
Or both of them together I am courting
Mari Mac's mother's making Mari Mac marry me
My mother's making me marry Mari Mac
Well, I'm going to marry Mari for when Mari's taking care of me
We'll all be feeling merry when I marry Mari Mac
Well, up among the heather in the hills of Bonifee
Well I had a bonnie lass sitting on me knee
A bumble bee stung me right above me knee
Up among the heather in the hills of Benifee
Mari Mac's mother's making Mari Mac marry me
My mother's making me marry Mari Mac
Well, I'm going to marry Mari for when Mari's taking care of me
We'll all be feeling merry when I marry Mari Mac
Hi diddly hi diddly hi diddle low
Well, I said, "Wee bonnie lassie, where you going to spend the day?"
She said "Among the heather in the hills of Benifee"
Where all the boys and girls are making out so free
Up among the heather in the hills of Benifee
Mari Mac's mother's making Mari Mac marry me
My mother's making me marry Mari Mac
Well, I'm going to marry Mari for when Mari's taking care of me
We'll all be feeling merry when I marry Mari Mac
Hi diddly hi diddly hi diddle low
The wedding's on Wednesday, everything's arranged
Soon her name will be changed to mine unless her mind be changed
And making the arrangements, I'm feeling quite deranged
Marriage is an awful undertaking
Mari Mac's mother's making Mari Mac marry me
My mother's making me marry Mari Mac
Well, I'm going to marry Mari for when Mari's taking care of me
We'll all be feeling merry when I marry Mari Mac
Hi diddly hi diddly hi diddle low
Sure to be a grand affair, grander than a fair
Going to be a fork and plate for every man that's there
And I'll be a bugger if I don't get my share
If I don't we'll be very much mistaken
Mari Mac's mother's making Mari Mac marry me
My mother's making me marry Mari Mac
Well, I'm going to marry Mari for when Mari's taking care of me
We'll all be feeling merry when I marry Mari Mac
Hi diddly hi diddly hi diddle low
There's a neat little lass and her name is Mari Mac
Make no mistake, she's the girl I'm gonna track
Lot of other fellas try to get up on her back
I'm thinking that they'll have to get up early
Mari Mac's mother's making Mari Mac marry me
My mother's making me marry Mari Mac
Well, I'm going to marry Mari for when Mari's taking care of me
We'll all be feeling merry when I marry Mari Mac
