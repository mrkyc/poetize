Well, you stole my heart
And I'll get it back
But look me in the eye, babe
Tell me why you love me like that
Why you love me like that? Oh

Well, I've walked this world
Five times or more
And after all this walkin', babe
Still got me crawlin' on the floor
Crawlin' on the floor

And I know (I know)
This world keeps on turning (Turning)
Keeps me yearning (Yearning)

How can you turn and walk away?
Pretending everything's okay
How can you turn your back?
Tell me why you love me like that
Why you love me like that? Oh
You might also like
Well, I thought you listened
But I'm shattered like broken glass
Well, I thought that we'd be different, babe
Yeah, I thought that we would last
Yeah, I thought that we would last

And I know (I know)
This world keeps on spinnin' (This world, spinnin')
Every minute that you're in it (That you're in it)

How can you turn and walk away?
Pretending everything's okay
How can you turn your back?
Tell me why you love me like that
Why you love me like that? Oh

Love me or leave me, baby
But don't lead me on (Oh, oh)
With lovin' like yours
Believe me, I'm better off
I'm better off alone
Oh, whoa
Well, I was your gypsy
Throwin' diamonds at your feet
Driftin' 'round you like a satellite
I gave you everything you need
Everything you need

And I know (I know)
This world keeps on turning (This world, turnin')
Keeps me yearning and yearning

How can you turn and walk away?
Pretending everything's okay
How can you turn your back?
Tell me why you love me like that
Why you love me like that?

Oh, how can you just break away?
Why can't you find the words to say?
Love is something you work at
Tell me why you love me like that
Why you love me like that?
Why you love me like that?
Oh, how can you throw us away?
Look at what you lost and
Now everything is shades of grey
And now you're pushin' me away
Say all the things you need to say
I thought we were goin' all the way
Play all the games you wanna play
