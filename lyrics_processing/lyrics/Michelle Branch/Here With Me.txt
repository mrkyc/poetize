It's been a long, long time since I looked into the mirror
I guess that I was blind, now my reflection's getting clearer
Now that you're gone, things will never be the same again
There's not a minute that goes by every hour of every day
You're such a part of me, but I just pulled away
Well, I'm not the same girl you used to know
I wish I said the words I never showed

I know you had to go away
I died just a little
And I feel that now you're the one I need
I believe that I
Would cry just a little
Just to have you back now, here with me
Here with me

You know that silence is loud
When all you hear is your heart
And I wanted so badly just to be a part
Of something strong and true
But I was scared and left it all behind

I know you had to go away
I died just a little
And I feel that now you're the one I need
I believe that I
Would cry just a little
Just to have you back now, here with me
Here with me
You might also like
And I'm asking (Asking)
And I'm wanting you to come back to me, please

I never will forget the look upon your face
How you turned away and left without a trace
But I understand that you did what you had to do
And I thank you (Thank you, thank you)

I know you had to go away (Oh, I know you had to go away)
I died just a little
And I feel that now you're the one I need (Oh, oh, oh)
I believe that I
Would cry just a little (Cry just a little)
Just to have you back now, here with me (Oh)
I know you had to go away (Oh, I know you had to go away)
I died just a little
And I feel that now you're the one I need (You're the one I need)
I believe that I
Would cry just a little (Cry just a little, baby)
Just to have you back now, here with me

Here with me
