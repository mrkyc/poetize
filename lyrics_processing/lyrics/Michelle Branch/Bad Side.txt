I can't help myself
I never learn
You put me through hell
But I like the burn
I turn my love into electricity
So you can feel how it feels inside of me

When we get low
We get high
Let your demons play with mine
Let your demons play with mine
When it feels like it's wrong
Then it's right
You tell yourself a lie
And believe it every time

'Cause l like the bad, like the bad side of you
'Cause l like the bad, like the bad side of you
'Cause l like the bad, like the bad side of you
'Cause I like the bad, like the bad side of you

I put my breath
Into the breeze
I send it to you
Over the seas
And I'm haunting you
While you're asleep
Making you dream only of me
You might also like
When we get low
We get high
Let your demons play with mine
Let your demons play with mine
When it feels like it's wrong
Then it's right
You tell yourself a lie
And believe it every time

'Cause l like the bad, like the bad side of you
'Cause l like the bad, like the bad side of you
'Cause l like the bad, like the bad side of you
'Cause I like the bad, like the bad side of you

You feel warmer than a gun
Pointed right at me
Heavy like the drums
'Cause we define insanity
Slowly going numb from staring at the sun

'Cause when we get low
We get high
Let your demons play with mine
Let your demons play with mine
When it feels like it's wrong
Then it's right
You tell yourself a lie
And believe it every time
Baby, it's not good when I'm with you
I put up with the hell you drag me through
I'll do anything you want me to
Because I like the bad inside of you

'Cause l like the bad, like the bad side of you
'Cause l like the bad, like the bad side of you
'Cause l like the bad, like the bad side of you
