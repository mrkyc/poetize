So I'm a little left of center
I'm a little out of tune
Some say I'm paranormal
So I just bend their spoon
Who wants to be ordinary
In a crazy, mixed-up world?
I don't care what they're sayin'
As long as I'm your girl

Hey, you were on my side
And they, they just roll their eyes

You get me
When nobody understands
You come and take the chance
Baby, you get me
You look inside my wild mind
Never knowin' what you'll find
And still, you want me all the time
Yeah, you do
Yeah, you get me (You get me)

So what if I see the sunshine
In the pouring rain?
Some people think I'm crazy
But you say it's okay
You've seen my secret garden
Where all of my flowers grow
In my imagination
Anything goes
You might also like
I, I am all you want
They, they just read me wrong

You get me (Get me)
When nobody understands
You come and hold my hand
Baby, you get me
You look inside my wild mind
Never knowin' what you'll find
Still, you want me all the time
Yeah, you do
'Cause you get me (You get me)

Hey, you were on my side
They, they just roll their eyes
Yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause you get me (You get me)
When nobody understands (When nobody understands)
You come and take the chance, baby
You get me (You get me)
When none of the pieces fit (When none of the pieces fit)
You make sense of it (You make sense of it)
You get me (Oh)
You look inside my wild mind
Never knowing what you'll find
And still, I want you all the time
Yeah, I do
'Cause you get me (You get me)
Yeah, oh-oh, oh
