Tell me where it hurts and I'll fix you up
If I am yours then say you're mine
I'll do anything that you ask me
For you I'd die

My heart cries out
I can't live without you
I can't go on without you
So scream out loud
Say that you want me
The way I want you

We're gonna live like it's the last night
We're gonna light up on the night sky
We're gonna love like it's the last time
(Don't you know it feels like)
We're gonna live like it's the last night
We're gonna light up on the night sky
We're gonna love like it's the last time
(Don't you know it feels like)

It makes a body cold when you're lonely
To want someone so much you cry
Crawl on hands and knees for you baby
I'd even lie
You might also like
My heart cries out
I can't live without you
I can't go on without you
So scream out loud
Say that you want me
The way I want you

We're gonna live like it's the last night
We're gonna light up on the night sky
We're gonna love like it's the last time
(Don't you know it feels like)
We're gonna live like it's the last night
We're gonna light up on the night sky
We're gonna love like it's the last time

I wonder where you go when you close your eyes
It drives me crazy 'cause I'll never know
And I just wanna feel how you feel inside
Inside

We're gonna live like it's the last night
We're gonna light up on the night sky
We're gonna love like it's the last time
(Don't you know it feels like)
We're gonna live like it's the last night
We're gonna light up on the night sky
