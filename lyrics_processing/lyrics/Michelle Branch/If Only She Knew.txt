I don't know whose side I'm takin'
But I'm not takin' things too well
I can see inside you're achin'
But is it still too early for me to tell?

I try to help you out through the hardest of times
Your heart is in your throat
And I'm speaking my mind
Though it looks as if it's over
I'm still not over you

'Cause I still love you like I did before
I know for sure
That you still feel the same way I do
If only she knew, whoa
If only she knew

I try to let it go, but I don't know if I can take it
(Don't know if I can take it)
'Cause the way you looked at me
Made me see that I can't really fake it
You might also like
I try to help you out through the hardest of times
Your heart is in your throat
And I'm speaking my mind
Though it looks as if it's over
I'm still not over you

'Cause I still love you like I did before
I know for sure
That you still feel the same way I do
If only she knew, whoa

I know she loves you and I can't interfere
So I just have to sit back and watch my world disappear
Oh-whoa

I try to help you out through the hardest of times
Your heart is in your throat
And I'm speaking my mind
Though it looks as if it's over
I'm still not over you
Oh, I'm still not over you
'Cause I still love you like I did before
I know for sure
That you still feel the same way I do, whoa
'Cause I will never, ever walk away
I'll find a way
She could never love you like I do
If only she knew, whoa
If only she knew, oh

If only she knew
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh, yeah
If only she knew
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh, if only she knew
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh, yeah
If only she knew
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh, if only she knew
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh, yeah
If only she knew, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
If only she knew
Oh, yeah
