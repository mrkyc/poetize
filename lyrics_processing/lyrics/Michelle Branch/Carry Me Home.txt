Running into you is the strangest thing
I never noticed how you look at me
I feel so funny asking "how you've been?"
I hear you're living in the city
Growing up is really make believe
They never told us 1983
These 16mm memories
And got us falling in slow motion

You make me feel like I've had too much to drink
The room is spinning and I trip on my feet
I'm seeing double saying things I don't mean
Just had a taste, I'm already wasted

And if I need you, would you carry me home?
You know I don't really care where we go
And in the morning under sheets and shadows
I think I love you, but what do I know?

I think I love you, but what do I know?

And I've been sitting second guessing all alone
I guess you know you'll never find it if you want it
And you've been standing right in front all along
Yeah, you've been standing right in front of me all along

And if I need you, would you carry me home?
You know I don't really care where we go
And in the morning under sheets and shadows
I think I love you
And if I need you, would you carry me home?
You know I don't really care where we go
And in the morning under sheets and shadows
I think I love you, what the hell do I know?
Carry me, carry me
