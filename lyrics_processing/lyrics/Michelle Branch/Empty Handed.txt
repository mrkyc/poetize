Here I am, take me
It's easier to give in
Some people mistake me
They only hear what they wanna hear
If you're losing sleep
Forgive me
I just can't keep pretending

I'm packin' my bags 'cause I don't wanna be
The only one who's drowning in their misery
And I'll take that chance, 'cause I just wanna breathe
And I won't look back and wonder how it's supposed to be
How it's supposed to be

There's a prism by the window
That lets the light leak in
I wish you would let me
You feel the water, but do you swim?
And it's only me
Empty handed
With a childish grin
And a camera
You might also like
I'm packin' my bags 'cause I don't wanna be
The only one who's drowning in their misery
And I'll take that chance, 'cause I just wanna breathe
And I won't look back and wonder how it's supposed to be
How it's supposed to be
How it's supposed to be

Lada, duda, duda, duda, duda
Lada, duda, duda, duda, dayiyayi
Lada, duda, duda, duda, dayiyayi
Lada, duda, duda
Lada, duda, duda, duda, duda
Lada, duda, duda, duda, dayiyayi
Lada, duda, duda, duda, dayiyayi
Lada, duda, duda

I'm packin' my bags 'cause I don't wanna be
The only one who's drowning in their misery
And I'll take that chance, 'cause I just wanna breathe
And I won't look back and wonder how it's supposed to be
How it's supposed to be
Tell me, How it's supposed to be
Tell me how, tlel me how
Tell me how it's supposed to be
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
The only one, the only who's drowning in their misery
Lada, duda, duda, duda, duda
Lada, duda, duda, duda, dayiayi
Lada, duda, duda, duda, dayiyayi
Lada, duda, duda

'Cause I'm packin' my bags
'Cause I'm packin' my bags
And I won't be back
Yeah, yeah
Packin' my bags 'cause I don't wanna be
Oh, whoa
