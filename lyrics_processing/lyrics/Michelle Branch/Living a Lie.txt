People tell you what you want
They tell you what you want to hear
You better get your story straight
You better get your answer clear

You're such a simple boy
You threw it all away
You're just a big mistake
I wanna tell it  to your face

Honey you're high
Been begging all night
You've done it before
Now you blame it on me
I'm losing my sleep
Can't take it no more

'Cause you're living in a lie
Everyone will realize
That you're living in a lie
Even when you close your eyes
You might also like
But you do it to yourself
You only do it to yourself
Running off your dirty mouth
Showing off your dirty ways

Stupid little girl
This isn't all a game
Look me in the eye
Say it to my face

Honey you're high
Been begging all night
You've done it before
Now you blame it on me
I'm losing my sleep
Can't take it no more

'Cause you're living in a lie
Everyone will realize
That you're living in a lie
Even when you close your eyes
'Cause people tell you what you want
'Cause people tell you what you want
'Cause you're living in a lie
You can break
You can shake
You can say what you want
Watch me walk away, walk away
Watch me walk away, walk away
You can break
You can shake
You can say what you want
Watch me walk away, walk away
Watch me walk away, walk away

'Cause you're living in a lie
Everyone will realize
That you're living in a lie
Even when you close your eyes
'Cause people tell you what you want
'Cause people tell you what you want
'Cause people tell you what you want
'Cause people tell you what you want
