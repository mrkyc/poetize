You were my first ever
I wish we'd never met
You drink to feel better
I'm drinking to forget

My heart is hungover
Roll over in my bed
I need something stronger
So I can breathe again

Remember when you said, "Together, forever?"
Whatever

You're not even good enough for a love song
You're just somebody that I wasted my youth on
Turn up the radio, I wanna let you know, oh
This isn't your love song
Oh oh no
This isn't your love song
Oh oh oh
Said this isn't your love song
You might also like
I'm not bitter
I'm not sorry
I'm not even heartbroken
Cause I knew when we started
That it would have to end

Remember when you said, "Together, forever?"
Whatever

You're not even good enough for a love song
You're just somebody that I wasted my youth on
Turn up the radio I wanna let you know, oh
This isn't your love song
Oh oh no
This isn't your love song
Oh oh oh
Said this isn't your love song

Long nights, cheap wine
I cry but never about you
It's slurred but I've got the last word
Long nights, more wine
I lied, I do think about you
It hurts, but I've got the last word
You're not even good enough for a love song
You're just somebody that I wasted my youth on
Turn up the radio, I wanna let you know, oh
This isn't your love song
Oh oh
No, this isn't your love song
Oh, here we come now, for a love song
You're just somebody that I wasted my youth on
Turn up the radio, I wanna let you know, oh
This isn't your love song
Oh oh oh
No, this isn't your love song
I said no, this isn't your love song
