Of all the things I've believed in
I just wanna get it over with
Tears form behind my eyes
But I do not cry
Countin' the days that pass me by
I've been searchin' deep down in my soul
Words that I'm hearin' are starting to get old
It feels like I'm startin' all over again
The last three years were just pretend
And I said

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to

I still get lost in your eyes
And it seems that I can't live a day without you
Closin' my eyes and you chase my thoughts away
To a place where I am blinded by the light
But it's not right

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
Oh, whoa
You might also like
And it hurts to want everything
And nothin' at the same time
I want what's yours and I want what's mine
I want you
But I'm not givin' in this time

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
Goodbye to you (Goodbye to you)
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew (Goodbye to you)
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
(The one thing that I tried to hold on to)
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
(The one thing that I tried to hold on to)

Oh, whoa
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
And when the stars fall, I will lie awake
