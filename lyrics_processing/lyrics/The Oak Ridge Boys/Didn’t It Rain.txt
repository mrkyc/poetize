He said Noah build me a vessel and make it out of gopher wood
Build it big, tall and strong so it won't be torn apart
Old Noah built him a masterpiece and he called it Noah's ark
Didn't it rain children, didn't it rain, rain, rain
Forty days and nights, didn't it rain?
Oh didn't it rain children, didn't it rain, rain, rain
Forty days and nights, didn't it rain?
He had a moose and a goose and a gander
Alligator and a big hippo
A monkey and an ape, a couple of snakes
A ram and a sheep and a goat
He had a possum and a 'coon and a black baboon
Ann eagle and a red-tailed hawk
A buck and a doe, a turkey and a crow
And a donkey trying to bark
He had leopards, lions and tigers
Bulls and a buffalo
Orang-utans and little bitty things
All lined up in a row
He had a dog and a cat and a gopher rat
And a great big grizzly bear
A mule and a cow, a boar and a sow
He had two of everything in there

He had apples, peaches, plums and pears
Grapes and apricots
Bees and beans and turnip greens
He had corn and baby squash
He had a pumpkin and a big watermelon
He had every kind of wheat
And just before he closed that door
He grabbed a handful of mustard seed
