Up in heaven tonight
Shining down on us
Glorious and bright
I'm gonna miss you every day
But I know that you're alright
There's a brand new star
Up in heaven tonight
There's a piece in my heart
Finally moving on
A calming like conscious
That sings my song
No longer will you struggle
No longer will you fight
There's a brand new star
Up in heaven tonight
Let the love shine down
(Let the love shine down)
Let the love shine down
(Let the love shine down)
Let the love shine down
(Let the love shine down)
Let the love shine down
(Let the love shine down)
