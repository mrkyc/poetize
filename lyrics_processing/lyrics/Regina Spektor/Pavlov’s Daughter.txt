The gravediggers gettin' stuck in the machine
Picking getting slim, slimmer
I hear them say my name
"Regina, Regina, Regina-ah-ah"
Yes, I'm putting the boulder to my ear
And I still can't hear
What'd you think I was an amateur
Playing with my temperature? (Cha-cha-cha-'ture)
If I hear another song about angels
If I see another feather on the dumb-box
I'm going to go to Babylon and get me some whiskey
Gonna go to Babylon and get me some whiskey now
If I hear another song about angels
If I see another feather on the dumb-box
I'm going to go to Babylon and get me some whiskey
Oh, get me some whiskey, oh, get me some whiskey now

My name is Lucille and I know how you feel
I live downstairs
I hear you taking out your garbage
I hear you loving your girlfriend
I hear you loving yourself too
I hear you flushing your toilet
I hear you turning your thoughts off
And I, I turn mine off too
The only thing I hear is you
And you don't sound nice, and you don't sound right
And you don't sound good, and you don't sound right
My name is Lucille and I know how you feel
I live downstairs
I hear you taking out your garbage
I hear you loving your girlfriend
I hear you loving yourself too
I hear you turning your thoughts off
I hear you turning your thoughts off

And it gets quiet, quiet, oh
Quite, quite quiet, quiet, quiet, oh, quiet, oh
Quite, quite qui'-qui'-qui', qui'-qui', qui'
Qui'-qui', qui'-qui', qui'-qui'
Qui'-qui', quite quiet, quite quiet
Quiet

Pavlov's daughter woke up in the morning
Heard the bell ring
And something deep inside of her made her want to salivate
So she lay there, drooling on her pillow
So she lay there, the sun skimming her skin
And, and drooling on her pillow (Woah, woah, woah)
Pavlov's daughter
Oh, and it was far away and hazy like a dream
Not a dream
But the ocean, not the ocean
But forever

As quiet as an ambulance staking out the neighborhood
Waiting for the blade to slip on that final blow
But nothing happens, it's a cruel joke
As ironic as a ticker tape parade over the rain forest
As ironic as a ticker tape parade over my head
As ironic as a ticker tape parade over my head going downstream
