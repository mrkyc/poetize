Down on Bowery, they lose their ball-eyes
And their lipped-mouths in the night
And stumbling through the streets
They say, "Sir, do you got a light?
And if you do then you're my friend
And if you don't then you're my foe
And if you are a deity of any sort
Then please don't go"

Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ah, ah, ah, ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas

And down on Lexington, they're wearing
New shoes stuck to aging feet
And close their eyes and open
And not recognize the aging street
And think about how things were right
When they were young and veins were tight
And if you are the ghost of Christmas Past
Then won't you stay the night?

Down in Bronxy-Bronx, the kids go
Sledding down snow-covered slopes
And frozen noses, frozen toes
The frozen city starts to glow
And, yes, they know that it'll melt
And, yes, they know New York will thaw
But if you are a friend of any sort
Then play along and catch a cold

Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
