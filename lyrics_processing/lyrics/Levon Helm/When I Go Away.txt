Early in the morning
A-when the church bells toll
The choir's gonna sing
And the hearse will roll
On down to the graveyard
Where it's cold and gray

And then the sun's gonna shine through the shadows
When I go away

Don't want no sorrow
For this old orphan boy
I don't want no crying
Only tears of joy
I'm gonna see my mother
Gonna see my father

And I'll be bound for glory in the morning
When I go away

I'll be lifted up through the clouds
On the wings of an angel
There's only flesh and bones in the ground
Where my troubles will stay
See, that storm over yonder
It's gonna rain all day
You might also like
But then the sun's gonna shine through the shadows
When I go away

(I'm going home - Lift me up - When I go away)
No more trouble
(I'm going home - Lift me up - When I go away)
No more crying
(I'm going home - Lift me up - When I go away)
No more trials
I'm going home to leave my worries in the graveyard
(I'm going home - Lift me up - When I go away)
No more troubles
(I'm going home - Lift me up - When I go away)
No more crying
(I'm going home - Lift me up - When I go away)
No more trials
I'm going home to leave my worries in the graveyard
Home to leave my troubles in the graveyard
Home to leave my trials

And I'll be bound for glory in the morning
When I go away
All my kin who love me
All my friends who care
Look beyond the dark clouds
We're gonna meet up there
When they lay me in the cold ground
Bow your heads and pray
(Bow your heads and pray)

And I'll be bound for glory in the morning
When I go away
And then the sun's gonna shine through the shadows
When I go away

(I'm going home - Lift me up - When I go away)
No more trouble
(I'm going home - Lift me up - When I go away)
No more crying
(I'm going home - Lift me up - When I go away)
No more trials
I'm going home to leave my worries in the graveyard
(I'm going home - Lift me up - When I go away)
No more troubles
(I'm going home - Lift me up - When I go away)
No more crying
(I'm going home - Lift me up - When I go away)
No more trials
I'm going home to leave my worries in the graveyard
Home to leave my troubles in the graveyard
Home to leave my trials
And I'll be bound for glory in the morning
When I go away
And then the sun's gonna shine through the shadows
When I go away

Ah, when I go away
When I go away
(When I go away)
When I go away
(When I go away)
