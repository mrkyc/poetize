Chicken man in Philly last night
And they blew up his house too
Down on the boardwalk
They're getting ready for a fight
Gonna see what them racket boys can do
Now there's trouble
Busing in from outta state
And the D.A. can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble on the promenade
And the gambling commissioner's hanging on
By the skin of his teeth
Everything dies
Baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies
Someday comes back
Put your makeup on
Fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight
In Atlantic City
You might also likeWell, I got a job and
I put my money away
But I got the kind of debts
That no honest man can pay
So I drew what I had
From the Central Trust
And I bought us two tickets
On that Coast City bus
Everything dies
Baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies
Someday comes back
Put your makeup on
Fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight
In Atlantic City
Now our luck may have died
And our love may be cold
But with you forever I'll stay
We're going out where
The sand turns to gold
So put on your stockings
'Cause it might get cold
Everything dies
Baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies
Someday comes back
Put your makeup on
Fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight
In Atlantic City
Now, I've been looking for a job
But it's hard to find
There's winners and there's losers
And I am south of the line
Well, I'm tired of getting caught
On the losing end
But I talked to a man last night
Gonna do a little favor for him
Well, everything dies
Baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies
Someday comes back
Put your hair up nice
And set up pretty
And meet me tonight
In Atlantic City
Meet me tonight
In Atlantic City
Oh, meet me tonight
