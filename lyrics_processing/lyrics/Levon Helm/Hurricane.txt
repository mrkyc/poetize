Thirty miles out in the Gulf Stream
I can hear them south winds moan
The bridges are looking lower
The shrimp boats are hurrying home
The old man down in the Quarter
Slowly turned his head
Took another sip from his whiskey bottle
And looked at me and he said

Said, I was born in the rain by the Pontchartrain
Underneath the Louisiana moon
I don't mind the strain of a hurricane
They come around every June
High black water, a devil's daughter
She's hard and she's cold and she's mean
But nobody's taught her that it takes a lot of water
To wash away New Orleans

A man come down from Chicago
Gonna set that levee right
It's got to be up about three feet higher
Won't make it through the end of the night
The old man down in the Quarter
Said, "Don't you listen to that boy!"
The water will be down by morning, son
And he'll be back on his way to Illinois

'Cause I was born in the rain by the Pontchartrain
Underneath the Louisiana moon
I don't mind the strain of a hurricane
They come around every June
High black water, a devil's daughter
She's hard and she's cold and she's mean
But we finally taught her that it takes a lot of water
To wash away New Orleans

You know I was born in the rain by the Pontchartrain
Underneath the Louisiana moon
I don't mind the strain of a hurricane
They come around every June
All this high black water, a devil's daughter
Hard and it's cold and it's mean
And we finally taught her that it takes a lot of water
