There ain't no space and time
To keep our love alive
We have existence and it's all we share
There ain't no real truth
There ain't no real lies
Keep on pushin' cause I know it's there

Oh, can you just tell me
It's all right (It's all right)
Let me sleep tonight
Oh, can you comfort me
Tonight (It's all right)
Make it all seem fine

I just can't make it alone
Oh, no, no (Tonight)
I just can't make it alone
Oh, no, no

There'll be no lullabies
There'll be no tears cried
We feel numb 'cause we don't see
That if we really care
And we really loved
Think of all the joy we'd feel
You might also like
Oh, can you just tell me
It's all right (It's all right)
Let me sleep tonight
Oh, can you comfort me
Tonight (It's all right)
Make it all seem fine

I just can't make it alone
Oh, no, no (Tonight)
I just can't make it alone
Oh, no, no (Tonight)
I just can't make it alone
Oh, no, no (Tonight)
I just can't make it alone
Oh, no, no

Ain't got no lullaby, no, no
Ain't got no lullaby, oh, no
There is no space and time
Oh, Lord
There is no space and time
Oh, Lord

We have existence and it's all we share
We have existence and it's all we share
We have existence and it's all we share
We have existence and it's all we share
We have existence and it's all we share
We have existence and it's all we share
We have existence and it's all we share
(Keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there)
We have existence and it's all we share (Keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there, keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there)
We have existence and it's all we share (Keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there, keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there)
We have existence and it's all we share (Keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there, keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there)
(Keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there)
