Big shout out

I got one more life
Can you see it wasting away?
But I got a plan, oh
Do you understand?

The drugstore wife
I was dealing soul and other white
I don't shake no hands, oh
'Cause death has no plans

But here we are, the rolling people, can't stay for long
We gotta go
So come alive with the rolling people, don't ask why
We just know

I'm on a big jet plane
With my briefcase and crime in my veins
I'll be the first to toast, yeah
To my rotten soul

So come alive with the rolling people, don't ask why
We just know now, yeah

Don't even know which way I'm going to
The lights are on and I am feeling blue
I hope you know which way I'm going to fly
Thank you for my life, I said goodnight, goodbye
You see me going

But here we are, the rolling people, can't stay for long
We gotta go
So come alive with the rolling people, don't ask why
We don't know now, yeah
