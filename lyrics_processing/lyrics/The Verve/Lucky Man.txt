Happiness, more or less
It's just a change in me, something in my liberty
Oh, my, my
Happiness, coming and going
I watch you look at me, watch my fever growing
I know just where I am

But how many corners do I have to turn?
How many times do I have to learn
All the love I have is in my mind?

Well, I'm a lucky man
With fire in my hands

Happiness, something in my own place
I'm stood here naked, smiling, I feel no disgrace
With who I am
Happiness, coming and going
I watch you look at me, watch my fever growing
I know just who I am

And how many corners do I have to turn?
How many times do I have to learn
All the love I have is in my mind?

You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
Got a love that'll never die (You know, you know, you know, you know)

Happiness, more or less

I'm a lucky man, ooh, yeah, ooh
It's just a change in me, something in my liberty (Don't think, don't, don't think I'm lying)
It's just a change in me, something in my liberty (Don't think, don't think I'm lying, I'm flying, come on now)
It's just a change in me, something in my liberty
