I've worked so hard, you know, I travel so much
We've had our differences that don't make a fuss
Each day I'm gone, my heart grows fonder for you
We've had the best of times

I'm there for you
And you're there for me, yeah

No need to worry, I'll be home soon
'Cause I'm rockin' with the boys
Don't be sad, I'm workin' tonight
I'm rockin' with the boys

Tour buses make me wanna jump out the door
I'm sick of truck stops and shit on the floor
What keeps me going are my memories of you
We've had the best of times

I'm there for you (I'm there for you)
And you're there for me, yeah
