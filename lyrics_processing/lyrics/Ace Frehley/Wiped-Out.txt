I went to a party, just so smartly
Cool as cool could be
I knew I could make it, knew I could shake it
Loose and fancy free
So I went to the table and reached for a bottle
And poured me a glass of wine
Took a few sips and looked around
I was feelin' fine
But an hour along, comin' on strong
I was gettin' drunk
Next thing I knew I looked at you
I was blind as a skunk
(Oh, oh, oh)
I was
I was wiped out
I had my lights out
Was fallin' right out
'Cause I was wiped out
Through the smoke-filled room I caught your eye
And I think that you caught mine
And I knew in a minute or maybe less
It was just a matter of time
You might also likeThen you started to move with such a groove
Stronger than sneakin' slow
Then you looked at me with your big blue eyes
They had such a glow
So I took your hand and tried to stand
And ended up sittin' back down
Then you smiled at me and gave me a wink
How quick I lost my frown
(Oh, oh, oh)
I was
I was wiped out
I had my lights out
Was fallin' right out
'Cause I was wiped out
So I looked at you and then I knew
That we were gonna have some fun
So I thought to myself, wine was out
We should switch to rum
So without a word and like some bird
We flew to another place
And pretty soon we were in some room
Stretched miles out in space
The room was turnin', we were burnin'
Things became a haze
It seemed that already I had too many
Firewater caused the blaze
(Oh, oh, oh)
I was
I was wiped out
I had my lights out
Was fallin' right out
'Cause I was wiped out
I was wiped out
Was fallin' right out
I had my lights out
'Cause I was wiped out
I was wiped out
I had my lights out
Was fallin' right out
'Cause I was wiped out
I was wiped out
Was fallin' right out
I had my lights out
'Cause I was wiped out
