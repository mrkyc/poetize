I've seen lovers flying through the air hand in hand
I've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun
And I've seen dreams that come from the heavenly skies above
I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides
And I've seen pigs all sitting, watching picture slides
But I ain't never seen nothin' like you
Do ya, do ya want my love, woman
Do ya, do ya want my face, I need it
Do ya, do ya want my mind, I'm sayin'
Do ya, do ya want my love
Well, I heard the crowd singin' out of tune
As they sat and sang "Auld Lang Syne" by the light of the moon
And I heard preachers bangin' on their drums
Rat-tat-tat-a
And I heard police playing with their guns
But I ain't never heard nothing like you
In the country, where the sky touches down
On the field, she lay her  down
To rest in the morning sun
They come a'runnin' just to get a look, just to feel, to touch her long black hair
They don't give a damn
You might also like'Cause I ain't never seen nothin' like you
Do ya, do ya want my love, woman
Do ya, do ya want my face, I need it
Do ya, do ya want my mind, I'm sayin'
Do ya, do ya want my love
C'mon!
Well, I think you know what I'm tryin' to say, woman
That is I'd like to save you for a rainy day
I've seen enough of this world to know that I've gotta
Got to get it all get it all to grow on ya
Do ya, do ya want my love, woman
Do ya, do ya want my face, I need it
Do ya, do ya want my mind, I'm sayin'
And do ya, do ya want the Ace
C'mon and tell me!
Do ya, do ya want my love
Do ya, do ya want my love
