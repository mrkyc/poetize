You should save for something better
You should save for something new
You should save 'cause this is shattered
You should save 'cause this is bruised

But it's mine and I won't leave it
I don't care what it means to you
'Cause you know I got a secret
Some scotch and it's as good as new

Scotch tape, I love you
You are my best friend
Scotch tape, I'll love you
'Til you bend

You are mine and I won't leave you
You're my fix, I don't need glue
I won't let teeth or scissors break you
We'll stick together 'til you're through

Well the story goes like this. You pin me down into place on the bed or against the wall. I fight back. I always fight back. And I couldn't move you away from me, I felt weak. Then you leave suddenly. Slam the door, steal the car, take the gun. Everyone in our apartment building thought we were crazy. I had meth one night and I left with the car and I parked on a dark street and I sat there in silence for hours. I stared at the moon thinking "Is this how you pray? Is this what he was looking for?"

Stick with me
For I am useless
Without you, my darling dear
Stick with me
For I am clueless
What to do in times of fear
'Cause I'm scared shitless
When I watch the news today
Stick with me
For I'm a victim
Just a product on display

Stick with me
Stick with me
Stick with me
Stick with me
Stick with me

Stick with me
For I am shiftless
I'm a drag from day to day
Stick with me
For I'm of interest
I have lots of things to say
Stick with me
'Cause I'm a genius
You light up when I am near
Stick with me
For life, it means less
Without you, my darling dear
Stick with me
Stick with me
Stick with me
