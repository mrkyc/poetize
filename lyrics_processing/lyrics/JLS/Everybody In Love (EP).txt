Everybody in love, go on put your hands up
Everybody in love, go on put your hands up
If you're in love, put your hands up
You know you need someone when the need's so strong
When they're gone you don't know how to go on
So the whole world is stuck in a moment
Standing still until they come back
You accept that they've got things to do
But sometimes in the end there's nothing left for you
If hurt is missing your baby
I've done too much of it lately
'Cause, every minute's like an hour, every hour's like a day
Every day lasts forever, but what else am I gonna do?
I'd wait forever and a day for you
I'd wait up, wait up
I can't eat, I can't sleep, what else could it be?
Missing you so deep, long as I'm where you're going to
I'd wait forever and a day for you
I'd wait up, wait up for you
I'd wait up, wait up for you
And even when we mad and say we're through
Deep inside you feel the same way I do
Might as well turn around and just end this
'Cause it's harder trying to stay mad
I could tell you that you can't stay here
Knowing just as soon as you disappear
That I'll be missing you, baby
Soon as you get up and you walk away
Every minute's like an hour, every hour's like a day
Every day lasts forever, but what else am I gonna do?
I'd wait forever and a day for you
I'd wait up, wait up
I can't eat, I can't sleep, what else could it be?
Missing you so deep, long as I'm where you're going to
I'd wait forever and a day for you
I'd wait up, wait up for you
Everybody in love, go on put your hands up
Everybody in love, go on put your hands up
Everybody in love, go on put your hands up
If you're in love, put your hands up
(Put your hands up)
Everybody in love, go on put your hands up
(Up)
Everybody in love, go on put your hands up
(Love)
Everybody in love, go on put your hands up
(Up)
If you're in love, put your hands up
(Put your hands up)
Every minute's like an hour, every hour's like a day
Every day lasts forever, but what else am I gonna do?
I'd wait forever and a day for you
I'd wait up, wait up
I can't eat, I can't sleep, what else could it be?
Missing you so deep
Long as I'm where you're going to
I'd wait forever and a day for you
