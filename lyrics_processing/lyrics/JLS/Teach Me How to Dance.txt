I like your moves
Girl I gotta keep up
Cause you're the truth
From the bottom and up
You keep the cool
But your performance is hot hot
Performance is hot hot hot hot hot

If you want me to, I'll make a move
Should I play by the rules, or copy you
Pardon if I intrude or if I'm rude
But I just wanna learn how you move

Teach me how to dance
