The Doctor's just finished telling me there's no time
Losing you could be the end of me and that I
Should do the things that I wanna do how could I
Without you, without you, ooh, ooh
Cause you're the only I let in
Tell me how to stop this feeling spreading
I'm hoping somehow that you know, ooh, ooh
Let's just get back together
We should've never broke up
They're telling me
That my heart won't beat again
We should have stayed together
Cause when you left me it stopped
They're telling me
That my heart won't beat again
Won't beat again
It's killing me
If I died
Yeah would you come to my funeral would you cry
Would you feel some regret that we didn't try
Or would you fall apart the same as I, I, I, I
See JLS LiveGet tickets as low as $57You might also likeAnd would it always haunt you baby
That you missed your chance to save me
Cause you know it's not too late
Let's just get back together
We should have never broke up
They're telling me
That my heart won't beat again
We should have stayed together
Cause when you left me it stopped
They're telling me
That my heart won't beat again
Won't beat again
It's killing me
I need you back in my arms
I need love CPR
Cause it's getting so cold, ooh
I need you back again
Or else I'll never mend
And girl if I go, I go, I go, I go
Let's just get back together
We should have never broke up
They're telling me
That my heart won't beat again
We should have stayed together
Cause when you left me it stopped
They're telling me
That my heart won't beat again
Won't beat again
It's killing me
