For the last time
Its the last chance to feel again
But you broke me
Now i can't feel anything
When i love you, rings so untrue
I can't even convince myself
When im speaking
Its the voice of someone else
Oh, it tears me up
I try to hold on, but it hurts to much
I try to forgive but its not enough
To make it all okay...
You can't play on broken strings
You can't feel anything
That your heart dont want to feel
I can't tell you something that ain't real
Oh the truth hurts, a lies worse
How can i give anymore?
When i love you a little less, than before
Oh what are we doing?
We are turning into dust
Playing house in the ruins of us
Running back through, the fire
When theres nothing left to say
Its like chasing the very last train
When its too late, (too late)

When theres nothing left to say
Its like chasing the very last train
When we both know its too late, (too late)

Oh you know when i love you a little less, than before
Let me hold you
