I was out with my lonely heart
First a movie and then to a new club
I wasn't planning on staying out long
But then this girl from my dreams just started smiling at me
Went up to say hello, said hi in stereo
She whispered in my ear, "Hey there, Romeo"
No, no, no, we dance more, we're on the dance floor
She's making me feel like no one else before

Hey, Mr. DJ, I can't see straight
What am I gonna do when the last song's over?
Sorry, Mr. DJ, hey, excuse me
What am I gonna do 'cause I can't let go of her?
What am I gonna do when the last song's over?
Now here's a chance that I cannot miss
I never thought I'd get lucky like this
But I only got one shot, I gotta show what I got
What am I supposed to do? I don't want to be a fool
Hey, DJ, help me out 'cause I am so confused
You see this every night, before they hit the light
Give me a chance, one more dance, can you press rewind?

Hey, Mr. DJ, I'm feeling dizzy
What am I gonna do when the last song's over?
Sorry, Mr. DJ, I know you're busy
What am I gonna do 'cause I can't let go of her?
(What am I gonna do? Just tell me what to do)
What am I gonna do when the last song's over?
(Said what am I gonna do? I can't let go of you)
What am I gonna do when the last song's over?
And I know it's getting late, feels like I'm pushing fate
The clock is ticking, baby, time won't hesitate
This is the last chance, we got the last dance
I'll know for sure if this is more than a romance

(What am I gonna do? Just tell me what to do)
(Please play one more song)
What am I gonna do when the last song's over?
(Said what am I gonna do? I can't let go of you)
(What am I gonna do?)
What am I gonna do when the last song's over?
Hey, Mr. DJ, can you hear me?
What am I gonna do when the last song's over?
Sorry, Mr. DJ, did you hear me?
