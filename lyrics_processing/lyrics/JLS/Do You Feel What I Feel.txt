Put you hands in the air baby

There's a girl dancing dirty over there
Do you see what I see
The way she moves I just had to stop and stare
Do you see what I see

There's a DJ playing all our favourite songs
Do you hear what I hear
We be drinking so we all just sing along
Do you hear what I hear

Dancing with you is so easy cos your beautiful
You make it hard for me girl every time we're on the floor
I wanna kiss you cos I gotta know that tonight is real

Do you feel what I feel?
Do you feel what I feel?
Do you feel what I feel?
This beat is killing the club
Do you feel what I feel
Two people falling in love
