Walking around like a wounded soldier
Out of my mind in a nightmare
Wishing it's over
Try to get over
How can I fight when my heart is frozen
Stumbling around in the twilight
Everything's colder
She left me colder (so cold)

I see her, feel her every movement
All around me
Every time I close my eyes
She invades my mind

And I don't know why she had to go
And I don't know where to turn
Or how to heal this heartbreak
Heartbreak
And I don't know why she had to go
And I don't know where to turn
Or how to heal this heartbreak
Heartbreak

She's like the fire and the flame in my heart (she's like the flame)
She's like a beautiful pain
Killing me softly (killing me softly)
And slowly
She's got a way that can break you to pieces (she's got a way)
Leaving you hurting for days
Try to get over try to get over
It's hard to get over

It's not easy, every time she leaves me
I go crazy
My head spins, my heart goes numb
All that's said and done

And I don't know why she had to go
And I don't know where to turn
Or how to heal this heartbreak
