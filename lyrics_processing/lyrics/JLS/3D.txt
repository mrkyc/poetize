Please put on your 3D glasses now

I wanna love in 3D
I'm gonna turn you on just like a TV
I'll have your body moving 'til your popping of the screen
I'll make your whole world transform in 3D, D, D, D, D, D, D

You turn of the lights getting ready for the show
The look in your eyes telling me you wanna go
Just let the music, just let the music take control
Usually love is nothing more than digital
We'll turn it around and take it three-dimensional
Into the future, into a future still unknown

So put your hands in the air
And feel the place come to life
Let me hear you say yeah
Wanna do it times 3 tonight
