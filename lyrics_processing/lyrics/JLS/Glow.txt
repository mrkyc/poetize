By my side, you're fighting even when it's not your war
You keep me breathing when I thought I might just lose it all
Like, when you say okay, I know you better, it ain't forever
I never imagined, oh, what a blessing, how did it happen?

It's the kinda love when you've lost that reminds you that you're winning (Okay)
Start again and ride the waves to new beginnings (I say)
Let's go, let's go
It's time for only love
It's time to live because
Ain't nobody else but

(Oh) It's the way I feel about you, feel about you
(Oh) Ooh, oh-oh-oh
(Oh) Know that I appreciate you, appreciate you
(Oh) I see you glow

You know I got you when the weight you carry starts to fall
When we ride together, we become invisible (Whoa)
It's that kinda love and you'll know it when you feel it (Yeah)

(Oh) It's the way I feel about you, feel about you
(Oh) Ooh, oh-oh-oh
(Oh) Know that I appreciate you, appreciate you
(Oh) I see you glow
