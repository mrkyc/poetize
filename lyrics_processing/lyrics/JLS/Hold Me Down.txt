Stuck on the darkside
Reaching for daylight
Nothing wrong with all right
But that ain't me
I make suggestions
Answers to questions
All that they told me
Was let it be

Cause all my life
You know I was dreaming about
About a way to find a way out
You know, You know
They can't hold me down
They say that man ain't meant to fly
But I'm reaching up for the sky
You know, You know
They can't hold me down

Countless obstacles in my life
I just can't seem to do right
But I keep trying
It seems they wanna knock me down
Like Mya, still I rise
It won't happen this time, no
I made up my mind

Mountains in my way, I can't lie
At times they seem too high
But I just climb
I told them that I won't stop 'til I reach the other side
They don't get to decide, no
I made up my mind

Cause all my life
You know I was dreaming about
About a way to find a way out
You know, You know
They can't hold me down
They say that man ain't meant to fly
But I'm reaching up for the sky
You know, You know

Nothing stays the same
Everything's meant to change
See, I'm meant to be free
So take your chains off me
I'm gonna turn it around
Nothing can stop me now
Some things are meant to be
This time it's about me
