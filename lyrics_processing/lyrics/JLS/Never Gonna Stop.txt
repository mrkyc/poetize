I'm never gonna stop, missing you, still be loving you
Wishing you were still mine
I'm never gonna stop thinking 'bout
What we were doing now, if you were still in my life

Do you remember our first time
When a world at war couldn't stop that kiss, no
Now we're standing on the front line
Never thought that it would end like this, no
And I won't let it show
But you know if you go, oh

I'm never gonna stop, missing you, still be loving you
Wishing you were still mine
I'm never gonna stop thinking 'bout
What we were doing now, if you were still in my life
I'm never gonna stop, cause I need you by my side
Never gonna stop, baby 'til I drop
Never gonna stop, now I know what I got

Now baby baby tell me
Did you mean it that one time when you said it's over
But you can't go back
Cause if I ever see you with a new guy
I don't know how I'll ever deal with that
No, but I won't let it show, oh no
But you know, if you go, oh, oh, oh, oh
