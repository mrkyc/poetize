But what's important is that you came
You can take my future now and hold it in your hands
There's no going back, tell me why you never want to
How come, how come
I could not see?
My heart, my heart
Shattered into pieces
No one, no one
Could ever reach me
It only made sense when you were standing right in front of me
Hey, do you know that you save my life
'Cause you came and you helped find
All the pieces, all the pieces of my heart
You taught me how I can live again
Didn't know all that I was missing
All the pieces, all the pieces, all the pieces of my heart
I didn't know this, I felt no pain
My heart was frozen, ice in my veins
Waiting at a station for a train that never came
Living in a city where nobody ever asked my name
How come, how come
You could break through?
You saved my life
Girl I owe it all to you
No one, no one
Had ever reached me
You fixed all of the pieces and you're standing right in front of me
Hey, do you know that you save my life
'Cause you came and you helped find
All the pieces, all the pieces of my heart
You taught me how I can live again
Didn't know all that I was missing
All the pieces, all the pieces, all the pieces of my heart
And my life is starting all over again
Like the sun coming up on a brand new day
Starting right here, starting right now
You and me girl, won't let anybody stop us now
'Cause my life is starting all over again
Hey, do you know that you save my life
'Cause you came and you helped find
All the pieces, all the pieces
You've got all the pieces of my heart (x3)
You've got all the pieces
You taught me how I can live again
Didn't know all that I was missing
All the pieces, all the pieces
Hey, do you know that you save my life
'Cause you came and you helped find
