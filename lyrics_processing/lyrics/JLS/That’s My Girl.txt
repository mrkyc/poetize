And she's the baddest thing I've seen in the world
You know that's my girl
They stop and stare but I'm okay with it
And I don't care cause it's a compliment
And on the real though
It's kinda turning me on, me on, hey!
Lady, lady tell me why you wear them heels
Drives 'em crazy you know how it makes me feel
Won't complain cause they all know that
You're coming home with me tonight
Yeah I know she bad, yeah she looking good
All these other guys - I know they wish they could
It's an everyday thing and what can I say
With a girl as bad as mine, I'd probably do the same
Cause that's my girl, that's my girl, that's my girl, that's my girl
And she's the baddest thing I've seen in the world
You know that's my girl
And I won't share but you can look
Cause to be fair my girl is off the hook
From the way she smiles and to the way she loves me
Her hair and lips are curved too she's really got me
Lady lady tell me why you wear them heels
Drives 'em crazy you know how it makes me feel
