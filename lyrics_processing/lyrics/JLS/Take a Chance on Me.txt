You're so scared to fall in love 'cause you end up in the dust
Everytime, everytime
Now you see us all the same like our words are just a game
Spitting lies, dirty lies

I know you know there's something here
But you cannot get past the fear
I can help you make it clear

So when you feel like trying again
Reach out, take my hand
See how great it could be
To fall in love with someone you can trust
Who would never give up
Cause you're all that he needs
Baby take a chance on me
Baby take a chance on me, oh oh
Baby take a chance on me
Baby take a chance on me, oh oh oh

You give 100 percent but you've never seen a cent
They're so blind, they're so blind
Cause I'm looking at your face and the world's a better place
In your eyes, lovely eyes

With the same in love in my heart
