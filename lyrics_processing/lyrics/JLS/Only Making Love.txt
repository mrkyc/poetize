It's funny how things work out
When you think they're locked down
Funny that you were taken for granted, yeah
I guess, I was feeling love
But you didn't care too much
And all of this time has been wasted

It's like you're guilty of the worst lovers crime
You shot me right down on the front line
You took the best things out of me but in time it'll heal
I'll be just fine, I'll be alright

What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna say?
I never thought that you
Were playing a game with me

You don't know how it feels
When you think you've got something
Then it is taken away
All you got left to say
You said it was only making love, oh, oh
You said it was only making love, oh, oh, oh

I ain't gonna scream and shout
Just gonna walk right out
Even though my heart feels like breaking
You've taken so much out of me
Sometimes it was hard to see
Didn't know the truth or whether you were faking

It's like you're guilty of the worst lovers crime
You shot me right down on the front line
You took the best things out of me but in time it'll heal
I'll be just fine, I'll be alright


You said it was only making love, oh, oh
You said it was only making love, oh, oh
You said it, you said it was only making love
That's what you said, this love is dead
I'm not gonna be waiting for you
Only making love
I know that I've gotta leave
You're not making it easy

You said it was only making love, oh, oh
You said it was only making love, oh, oh
You said it was only making love, oh, oh
