I can't believe, finally
She's tryna break out of her shell
She's adament to achieve
Her world's her oyster
You would never tell

She's so authentic, so unsuspected
This girl can go to school
And be respected
Her expression is a smile on her frown
Goes home and it's upside down
Walks through the door this little miss she's creeping
Know the sound will get her beating
Why oh, why, is this girl still weeping
Can't say anything cause she feels she's creeping

She's just a few degrees shy of the cool
Gotta change the rules, yeah
She's just a few degrees shy of the cool
Gotta change the rules, yeah

I'll find away, is what you said
Those words still rotate in my head
I sit there, thinking
How I can turn this around
