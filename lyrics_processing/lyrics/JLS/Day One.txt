A hundred thousand roses
Couldn't say how much I feel for you
And I don't care who knows it
I don't love no one like I love you

And everybody wanna waste their time
Nobody wanna find their true love
But my future is with you, girl
'Cause you're my day one
My ride or die
From day one
You've been by my side

And I think it's time I told you that

I always wanna make you proud of me
Never gonna question loyalty
When no one believed in me, yeah
I didn't have no one that I could turn and talk to
You were the only one who
Showed up, you stayed there from day one

It's like your love gets stronger
Stronger as the days, months, years go by
I wanna hold on longer
Long enough 'til we're dancing in the sky, oh

And everybody wanna waste their time
Nobody wanna find their true love
But my future is with you, girl
'Cause you're my day one
My ride or die
From day one
You've been by my side

And I think it's time I told you that

I always wanna make you proud of me
Never gonna question loyalty
When no one believed in me, yeah
I didn't have no one that I could turn and talk to
You were the only one who

And I think it's time I told you that

I always wanna make you proud of me
