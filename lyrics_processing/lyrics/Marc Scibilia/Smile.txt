It's just one look you can make the world smile
'Round and around and around we fly
It's just one look you can make the world smile
'Round and around and around we fly
It's just one look you can make the world smile
When I see you smile
Your side effect-less medicine
Don't have to die to get to heaven
Out of everywhere I've ever been
I've never found something better than
Good lord, is this mercy
Your love when it's blurry
If I drink from a cup that fills right back up
I'm never gonna be thirsty
When I see you smile
Stars come shining through
When I see you smile
It makes me smile too
It makes me smile too
I feel like the sun shining on my face
Like Santa Monica in roller skates
I wanna lift my hands and give Him praise
Sing Amazing Grace every time I see your face like
You might also likeOh, oh, I need you
Oh, when I see you smile
Stars come shining through
When I see you smile
It makes me smile too
I said, it makes me smile too
