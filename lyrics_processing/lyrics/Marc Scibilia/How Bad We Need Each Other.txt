Life is too far to walk alone
You can't do it on your own
It's like bare hands digging through stone
And if things go down much steeper hills
Even money won't pay these bills
But time will show, show, show

People gonna be okay
Storms never come to stay
How bad we need each other
How bad we need each other
And the trials of today
They are signs along the way
How bad we need each other
How bad we need each other

And I can get so high on myself sometime
I keep on drifting a million miles from this planet
What a shame it would be to look back on our life
And realize that I've taken you and me for granted
Not gonna do it now

People gonna be okay
Storms never come to stay
How bad we need each other
How bad we need each other
And the trials of today, yeah
They are signs along the way
How bad we need each other
How bad we need each other

And I cannot see with tomorrow 'round the bend
I don't know where this world is headed or where it may end
But you gave me this smile and so I threw away my frown
And I ain't gonna pick up something if I just put it down

People gonna be okay
Storms never come to stay
How bad we need each other
How bad we need each other
And the trials of today, you know
They are signs along the way
How bad we need each other
How bad we need each other
People gonna be okay
Storms never come to stay
How bad we need each other
How bad we need each other
And the trials of today, yeah
They are signs along the way
How bad we need each other
