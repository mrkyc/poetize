Standing alone at a party
Where we never know anybody
I know the house, I know the street, I find you every time I fall asleep
And I try to tell you that I'm sorry

I have this dream
Everything's the way it was, 'til the moment I wake up
Then it hits me
Like a bullet in the dark and I wonder where you are
I have this dream (Keeping me up at night, keeping me up at night)
I have this dream (Keeping me up at night, keeping me up at night)

I have this dream where I'm paying you all my attention
And I'm saying what I should have said when
When you and me were more than a dream and I wasn't talking to you in my sleep
Now the morning is breaking the tension
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, how I wish that I could stay
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I have this dream
Everything's the way it was, 'til the moment I wake up
Then it hits me
Like a bullet in the dark and I wonder where you are
I have this dream (Keeping me up at night, keeping me up at night)
I have this dream (Keeping me up at night, keeping me up at night)
You might also like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, how I wish that I could stay here
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, how I wish that I could stay here
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right here
I have this dream
I have this dream

I have this dream
Everything's the way it was, 'til the moment I wake up
Then it hits me
Like a bullet in the dark and I wonder where you are
I have this dream (Keeping me up at night, keeping me up at night)
I have this dream (Keeping me up at night, keeping me up at night)
I have this dream (Keeping me up at night, keeping me up at night)
I have this dream (Keeping me up at night, keeping me up at night)

(Keeping me up at night, keeping me up at night)
And it just keeps on (Keeping me up at night, keeping me up at night)
And it don't stop (Keeping me up at night, keeping me up at night)
Ya just keep on (Keeping me up at night, keeping me up at night)
I have this dream (Keeping me up at night, keeping me up at night)
I have this dream (Keeping me up at night, keeping me up at night)
And it's keeping up all night (Keeping me up at night, keeping me up at night)
It's keeping me up all night (Keeping me up at night, keeping me up at night)
I have this dream, dream
