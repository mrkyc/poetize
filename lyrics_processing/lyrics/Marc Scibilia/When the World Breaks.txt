They say the world is getting smaller
Shrinking by the day
And if it gets any smaller
It'll probably go away
They say the world is getting colder
And no one can explain
We are quickly getting older
The unnecessary pain

That's not the way I see it, no
Every time I look into your eyes
That's not the way I see it, no
Every time

Cause I know, know, know
I know we're gonna make it
No matter what it takes
And I know, know, know
That everything is fading
We'll be the only thing together
When the world breaks
When the world breaks
You might also like
The say nothing lasts forever
And the end is still inside
No body can hang onto through the weather
No body will make it to the night

That's not the way I see it
Every time I look into your eyes
That's not the way I see it, no
Every time

Cause I know, know, know
I know we're gonna make it
No matter what it takes
And I know, know, know
That everything is fading
We'll be the only thing together
When the world breaks, yeah
When the world breaks, hey

I don't care, I don't care
I don't care what they say
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care what they say
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care what they say
I, I don't care
Every time
When the world, when the world
Cause I know, know, know
I know we're gonna make it
No matter what it takes
And I know, know, know
That everything is fading
We'll be the only thing together
When the world breaks
(I don't care, I don't care, I don't care)
When the world breaks
(I don't care, I don't care, I don't care)
We'll be the only thing together
