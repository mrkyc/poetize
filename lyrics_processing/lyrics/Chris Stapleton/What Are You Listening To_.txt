I put that record on
Girl, you know what song
And I let it play again and again
You're in every line
Takes me back in time
Yeah, tonight I'm wondering

What are you listening to?
Is it a cover band?
In some college town bar
Where it's na, na, na's
And air guitars
Or is it?
Something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still falling
Heart's still breaking
'Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song?
About someone new?
What are you listening to?

I like to believe
That you're just like me
Trying to figure out how a good thing goes bad
I don't know
I can't let it go
Yeah, it's about to drive me mad

What are you listening to?

Is it a feel good song
Gets you driving too fast
The one that gets you moving
On past the past
Or the kind that you can't help singing along
Singing woah-oh-oh-ohhh
If it's headphones on
On a downtown train
Or the window seat
On an outbound plane
Is it LA sunny?
Or Memphis blue?
I wish I knew
I wish I knew
