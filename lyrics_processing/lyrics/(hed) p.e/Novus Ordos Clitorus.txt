By the time it's almost over you...
Get up, get up, fight!
Announcing the birth of the new world order as pronounced by the seers of doom
Bow down to the almighty dollar who's at the top and where are you
A Trojan horse is inside the border A secret hidden in plain view
Its funk dude nigga bring me the doctor This black magic world white collar
I gotta get out, out of California
New World Order, New world order
I gotta get out, out of California
New world order, new world order
9-11 now watch your back
Yeah one-hundred-twenty years ago the illuminati stripped us of bohemian growth
Burning 3rd degree free masons of old the American doctor the skull and bones
The matrix sign of the sacred geometric doctrines of hatred
Separation programmed for generations the perfect death of a nation
I gotta get out, out of California
New World Order, New world order
I gotta get out, out of California
New world order, new world order
You might also likeI gotta get out, out of California
New World Order, New world order
I gotta gotta, gotta get out
People of America please stay calm, please stay in your homes
The terrorists are coming to get you, please be very afraid
Please be very afraid, pay no attention to your minds eye
I woke up in a nightmare I want to know is it too late
The future is not yet written and our numbers are too great
They see us like cattle they see us as profane
The sit at the top of the pyramid American royalty what's the big secret
I don't want to go to Guantanamo bay
I don't want to go to Guantanamo bay
I don't want to go to Guantanamo bay
Don't let them come and take me away
Don't let them come and take me away
Don't let them come and take me away
Don't let them come and take me away
Don't let them come and take me away
Get out, get out, get out
New world order, new world order
I gotta get out, out of California
New World Order, New world order
