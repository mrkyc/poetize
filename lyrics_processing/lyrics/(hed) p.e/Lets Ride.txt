I drink, I smoke, I fuck
My kind we fight in the club
I mix up that vodka with that chronic and I feel that love
I dream, I work, I bleed
I say things that I don't really mean
I'm not into jailbait but my girlfriend's only seventeen
Can I hit that, can I rip that, can I lick that, can I get that from behind?
I'm murderin' and stabbin' so much vag I'm wanted for vagacide
I'm livin a life of sin, no I don't have any friends
Now the rain is coming and I'm runnin from myself again

I feel this darkness coming over me
It's takin over me
Now you can rest in pieces by
The time the sun goes down
Now nigga you can rest in pieces

Let's ride! Yeah everybody gonna die
Fuck the world nigga, ain't nobody gettin' out alive
Let's ride motherfucka, we all gonna die
We already dead, ain't nobody gettin' out

I paint a picture that's perfect so you can see what I'm sayin'
I state it perfectly clearly so that you know I ain't playin'
Cause I don't give a fuck about you or that shit that you sayin'
Because you caught up in the matrix, you blind, you sleepin' homie
I dream, I work, I bleed, I, I say things that I don't really mean
But mostly when I drink too much and I'm smoking too much kush and
I'm under too much pressure, I think I think too much
I can't find my piece of mind I feel like I'm losin' touch
You might also like
I feel this darkness comin' over me
I can't take it, I can't escape all this hatin'
It's my turn I'm retaliatin' now
By the time the sun goes down
I know you feel me nigga, you feel me nigga?

Let's ride! Yeah everybody gonna die
Fuck the world nigga, ain't nobody gettin out alive
Let's ride motherfucka, we all gonna die
We already dead ain't nobody gettin out
So throw your guns up playa and raise 'em up high
It's a revolution, you know we can't be denied
This is P E homie, we born to ride
This a motherfuckin' gang and we down for life
Let's ride! All day, all night
Let's ride! Its dead or alive
Lets ride! Everybody gonna die
Fuck the world nigga, ain't nobody gettin out

No, no I won't stop, I just rock, and I battle your whole clique
You a homo, you a trick, silly faggot ass bitch
I expose that dirty bitch for the ho that she is
Make her cry, make her thighs twitch, then cum on her tits
I'mma rock, I'mma a roll, I'mma a shock to your soul
When I flow niggas know I'm like now, come on though
Every note that I wrote will make you jump out your throat
On that high oh so high so I don't know where the time goes
I try to do right, and I can't figure out
Why I get schizo and psycho I go Jeckle to Hyde
It's these voices inside, it's that darkness above me
Makes me turn away from good to bad then to ugly
That's why drugs seem so lovely like a way to escape
All this ugliness above me how much more can we take
'Til we break and we take back the world from these fake motherfuckers
