Something inside tells me to grab this pen and write it down
That very same voice tells me to grab this joint and light it now
There must be something in these trees that keep me sane
Because I got these tendencies to put a bullet in your brain
Suicidal tendencies to grab a razor blade
Chop a line as long as Thailand and inject it in my brain
And it wasn't even Yayo, it was crystal Drain-O
Fuck Nancy Rea-ho, don't just say no
Just say yes and go have sex on ten hits of X
Let ten guys cum on your chest just make sure I'm next
I had my aids test and I think I passed
Now - go in the room bitch and clean up the mess

Give us what we want
I want to violate you
Why won't you wake up?
My friend please let me rape you
I hate you, I'll break you
I want you broken in half
Give us what we want now!!!

Something inside of us keeps telling us to not give up
Something inside of me says all roads lead to tragedy
How can you stay mad at me, I'm just a clown
A nobody I don't even exist to you
So how can I mean shit to you
So stop pretending that you care whether I laugh or cry
You a phony you a fake, it's time for you to die
You and me'll always be enemies
It's like you the Arab and I'm the Israeli
You might also like

Something inside of your vagina's got me homicidal
When you bend over, it's all over, rover's takin over
Fat, skinny, short, tall, I think I've fucked 'em all
I'm not sure, I can't remember from the alcohol
Demoral, Percoset and Xanax
But now I only fuck with the pussy and smoke cess-
Imilia, ria lena eu chi amo maizia
Translation - Dear Mama I can't wait to see ya
