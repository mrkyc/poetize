Never die
Fuck you
You see me, I see through you
You say fuck me, I say fuck you
You don't love me? I don't love you
I rise above and I say fuck you bitch
X2

I don't know how I find the power to face these fuckin' cowards
All I really wanna do is disembowel one every hour
Go home, smoke a joint, and beat off in the shower
Then dispose of all the evidence and pop a couple downers
You know me then you know I really have no friends
Get a high a lot, I drink and drive a lot
The innocent they die a lot
Now don't be fooled when you see me smile a lot
Cause I go punk rock, blow up ya' whole block

Nigga', wake up, wake up motherfucker wake up
I don't give a fuck motherfucker wake up
You not punk rock, bitch, you just a punk
Die motherfucker die motherfucker die
Die motherfucker die motherfucker die
Get high motherfucker high motherfucker high
We ride motherfucker or motherfuckin' die

Semper Fi! Put 'em up I'm ready for a fight, these 1st amendment rights
Are guaranteed to me regardless if I say shit you don't like
So every night I grab that mic and spit shit just for spite
If I could push some buttons why the fuck should I recite?
Poems are meant to shed some light on all these hypocrites and sodomites
Buddy I'll incite a riot in this twilight zone tonight
Cause I don't give a fuck, so shut the fuck up
Or I'll go straight punk, blow ya' whole block up


Jesus fucking Christ
Why is life as cold as hell?
And why can't I control myself?
Why am I so insecure?
I don't even know myself
I'm so fucking immature I tried to grow hydro myself
If I had the power I'd bring back the twin towers myself!
Then I'd gather up all the Al Qaeda cowards
Now y'all burn in hell
Now you get what you deserve
Now you know not to fuck with my brother Nick Berg
Now shut the fuck up
Or I'll go straight punk and blow ya' whole block up
