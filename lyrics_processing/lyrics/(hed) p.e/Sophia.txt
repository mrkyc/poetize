Yeah I just wanna do you right
Show you all this love and mommy treat you right
Take me from the darkness into the light
I read you like a book, Sophia treat me right
I was in the desert I was walking with the dead
I was lost and I found Sophia on the internet
Now it's on cause I'm tired of living with the one-percent
Now it's on cause I'm ready for that ninety-nine percent

I just want to show you love, show you love, show you love
I just want to do you right, do you right, do you right
I just want to show you love, show you love, show you love
I just want to do you right, do you right, do you...Understand

Yeah you were always there for me
Even when they lied about my history
They were met Sophia in the University
High society says that she's too good for me
Listen, you can't keep us apart
Sophia stole my heart
What gives you the right to keep us
All up in the dark Devil
She's not your girl she's mine
Geometric so sublime
She's not your girl she's mine
Geometric so sublime

Come on baby take a walk with me
Down the cold dark center of the mystery
I'll break the code if you turn the key
Come on baby take a walk with me
Come on baby take a walk with me
Come on baby take a walk with me
Come on come on come on
Hahaha yeah! Yeah...

Yeah I just wanna do you right
Show you all this love and mommy treat you right
Take me from the darkness into the light
I read you like a book, Sophia treat me right
Sophia take my hand
Without you I'm half a man
I was blind now I can see
Look Sophia what you done to me
Look Sophia what you've given me
I was in bondage now I'm free
Look Sophia what you did to me
I was in bondage now I'm free

Come on Come on Come on
