Yeah

You thought i would just
Walk away
Run and hide
Crawl under a rock
No i am not
And never will be a quitter
Always have been
And always will be a sinner
She turned 18
I turned her over
Put it in her
Daddy's not even trying
So baby's lying there crying
Like she waited till she turned 18
To break her hymen
Dumb ass hooker
Ain't nothing but a dyke
Suddenly i see
Some crackers that i don't like
Skin head crackers
Swastikas ain't shit

I hit with both fists
Both feet
36 teeth
And a 40 inch reach
The kkk
Can't fuck with me
You can't fuck with me
I'm an untouchable street nigga
It's HB south side
17th nigga
Between the sheets it's me and my girlfriend
All i need in this life of sin
Is me and my boyfriend
All i need in this life of sin
Is me and my bitch
I'm not the type of nigga
Take you out on a date
Get one thing straight
I got pussy in all 50 states
No momma don't make me wait
Like you a virgin
Yeah right
Baby's peeing on the ceiling
Piggy's squealing on the first night
How can you look in the mirror
When you wake up
Acting like this shit never happened
You need to wake up
Somebody call a fucking ambulance
She won't wake up
She need a shot of adrenaline
To do her makeup
Hey dude
This chick won't wake up, man
Shut up
I think something's wrong with her
Shut up
Fuck you, man
I'm fucking serious
All i need in this life of sin
Is me and my boyfriend
All i need in this life of sin
Is me and my bitch
Hey baby
What?
Come over here and grab the mic
And talk some shit
Alright
Talk some dirty shit
Okay

You can suck daddy's dick
And i'mon fuck it till it suffers
Till the seam splits
You better change the sheets
Better change the mattress
Better call the plumber
Call the gynecologist
Come on
All i need in this life of sin
Is me and my bitch
All i need in this life of sin
Is me and my bitch
All i need in this life of sin
Is me and my bitch
All i need in this life of sin
