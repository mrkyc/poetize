Ain't nothing working
Ain't nothing right
There's a hole in me that I can't fill
No matter how hard I try

(Hey, hey) Hey bartender, hit me with a double
And introduce me to that girl with the bubble
Huh, I'm looking for trouble tonight
No, mama, don't trust me tonight
You be the center, baby
I'll be the quarterback
Hike, hit the tailback
Watch it on the playback
Jah smash that, hitting that redbone
Up in the endzone biting on the collarbone

I just want your company
I want you to comfort me, just come with me

Hey bartender, hit me with another
I just about had to kill this brother
Shit, I'm looking for trouble tonight
No mama don't trust me tonight
You be the beauty, baby
I'll be the beast
Who give a fuck?
Take it to the bedroom, take it the streets
Take it like a man, motherfucker
Yo bitch chose me, motherfucker
You might also like
I just want your company
I want you to comfort me, just come with me
I just want your company
I want you to comfort me, just come with me

Take me there, take me with you
I can't be alone tonight
I can't trust myself tonight
I can't trust myself tonight
Babe please don't trust me tonight
Take me there, take me with you
I can't be alone tonight
I can't trust myself tonight
I can't trust myself tonight
No you can't trust me tonight, woah

Ain't nothing working
Ain't nothing right
There's a hole in me that I can't fill
No matter how hard I try
Ain't nothing sweeter
There ain't nothing wrong
All the pain that I receive keeps me strong
It keeps me moving on
I just want your company (Moving on)
I want you to comfort me, just come with me
I just want your company
I want you to comfort me, just come with me
I just want your company
I want you to comfort me, just come with me

Comfort me, just come with me
