It's that fire
It's just another day
Gotta wake up to the pain
Those demons inside
They wanna come outside and play
Those demons are high and
I gotta make em go away
Tonight, we raise hell
We take everything in sight
Why not?
Another night what kind of trouble can we find
Never ever coming down
We high, kissing the sky
I can't feel my face I'm so wasted I wanna die
But I'm young just having fun
So why, not drink and drive?
You dead from all that whiskey
And now the vodka
Drinking cocaine, sniffing marijuana
And now there's Xanax Valium and Vicodin
That's right it never ends
I'm in pain, so here we go again
Let's get it right
Can I get you by my side
Can I get you from behind
It lets me know that I'm alive
But I'm not, feeling sublime
I try, to walk the line
I'm high, all of the time
Fucked up, out of my mind
You might also like
I can't stop, I'm feeling numb
The coke mixed with the rum
The blow is like a gun
My soul is on the run
It's the way straight to hell
I'm with that whiskey, the vodka
Cocaine and marijuana
Ridin' with the devil
My life full of drama
I'm out of control
Now it's a motherfucking shame
I can't face another day

I wanna feel
I wanna feel what's real
Yeah I wanna feel
I wanna feel what's real
WASTED
Wasted in babylon
WASTED
Chasing the dragon
WASTED
I'm lost in bablyon
WASTED
Chasing the dragon
WASTED
Wasted in babylon
WASTED
Chasing the dragon
WASTED
I'm lost in babylon
WASTED
Chasing the dragon

It's that fire!
I'm feeling so fine
I gotta go out and get mine
I gotta wake up and get high
I gotta find my peace of mind
But it's hard, so hard to find
It's hard to stay on the grind
When everyday's a Monday and the sun won't shine
I'm so tired of living a lie
No matter how hard I try
These bills won't pay themselves
And this bank account is dry again
My only friend is this red red wine
My only solace is motherfucking chronic
I'm on it, hand me that JD
Crack open that vodka
Line up that cocaine
Roll up that marijuana
I'm on it, yes I was born with this addictive personality
I've found a way to escape this fucked up reality
I'm insecure, uncomfortable in my skin
I'm a loser, I never win
I keep just trying to fit in
But I'm not, feeling sublime
I try, I walk the line
I'm high all of the time
Fucked up, out of my mind


Oh oh oh
