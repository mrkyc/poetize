Can't stop me
You a pussy
I'm a god
It was all a dream
I was smokin' all the finest weed
I'm like a Kottonmouth King, I never find a seed
I'm like Sid Vicious- in 78'
I wake up, handcuffed, but I'm doin' it my way
Stop, listen, what's that sound?
That's the sound of the revolution, the underground
That's the sound of my heartbeat
War drums pound like "Hey yah yah yah"
You know I'm down
I'm a rebel, I'm a warrior, I'm a sad clown
That's why i drink til the sun goes down
That's why I smoke when I wake up
And stay so high
Nobody wants to see the soldiers die and
Nobody understands the Muslims either but
Everybody understands the word survival
That's why we investin' in the Smith and Wesson
That's why we gotta stay ready for any enemies testin' me
I pity the fool who gets between me and my destiny
I take you to school stupid
I teach you a lesson not to fuck with me
Little bitch, I'm a god
Besides motherfucker, who's side you on?
Come on

Uh, I need some head
Say uh i need some head, haha!

Game over were taking over
I'm on the front-line, I'm a soldier
You're a liar, a vampire, I tell the truth
I wear a blue collar!
I refuse to throw my life away! x4

Checkmate!
Game over
This a take over
We can talk about it
Or we can go to war
I'm a soldier bitch
You a motherfucking pussy
I fuck you so hard
Like I fucked this groupie
I can't be stopped
I'm solar powered
I'm an old school rebel
You a new school coward
A black Aryan, I been here before man
American made new world warrior
I don't give a fuck what you think about me
If you don't know then you should ask about me
Mr. Hip hop - Mr. Punk Rock - yo, Mr. Huntington beach
It's ya boy Jahred, it's not what you expected
The most def, the most hardcore respected
One gun - number one - still most requested
Ha, i teach a girl to cum in one easy lesson
Teach a fan to look around him and question
The media, and the public school system
Rosicrucians and the free-masons
Could some sand niggas pull of 9/11?
Is there really a hell and a heaven?
NO! what do you think Jesus meant
When he said "be born again?"
That nigga was talkin' about reincarnation
Woah! That's enough knowledge for now
Pass me that joint
Bitch it's going out
Take a hit


You can't take my life away! x6
You can't take it!

I'd rather be dead than be a fuckin' prisoner in your matrix of fucking consumer bullshit!
Go ahead spend your money on some stupid fucking trend
Some shit that's gonna be gone by next year
Wear your hair like a girl
Wearin' girls pants like a fucking queer
Keep crying about your little cheating slut of a girlfriend
Like a fucking little baby
Be a man
Checkmate
The signs are all around you
Yo man, you hear something
You don't know what I'm talking about
Wikipedia that shit
Stay informed man
