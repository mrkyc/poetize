It's just a phase
Eh oh
They all love to see you fall
Flat on your face
Eh oh
It seems as hard as I try
They under estimated
Eh oh
I don't belong here anymore
No, it's not me
No, I can't breathe
No, I am not afraid
It's just the end of the day
How can I give in
When I can not let go
Show me the way
How can I get out of this hole?
Just bring it

Through this wall of lies
No one can see
Eh oh
These words are much more
Myself than I
