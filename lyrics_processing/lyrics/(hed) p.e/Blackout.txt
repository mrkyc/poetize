I blackout!

Don't you put words in my mouth
Don't try to shut me up
I'm not about plastic skin
I gotta get out, gotta get out, in

What about those things you said to me?
What about the time we've wasted?
Everyday's just like the one before
Everytime I see your face.....

(I blackout)
You know I gotta get in
(I blackout)
Just let me in
(Blackout)
You know I gotta get in
But, I gotta know now, where do I fit in?
(Blackout)
You know I gotta get in
(I blackout)
Just let me in
(Blackout)
You know I gotta get in
But, I gotta know now, where do I fit in?
You might also like
Don't you tell me what to think
You'll never know how I should feel
I see through plastic skin
I gotta get out gotta get out, in

What about the 5 o'clock news?
What about the Sunday paper?
Every day's just like the one before
Everytime I turn the page.....

(I blackout)
You know I gotta get in
(I blackout)
Just let me in
(Blackout)
You know I gotta get in
But, I gotta know now, where do I fit in?
(Blackout)
You know I gotta get in
(I blackout)
Just let me in
(Blackout)
You know I gotta get in
But, I gotta know now, where do I fit in?
I can't breathe
My heart is freezing
While we pray
My soul is packing its bags and leaving
Blackout!
Blackout!
Blackout!

What about those things you said to me?
What about the time we've wasted?
Everyday's just like the one before
Everytime I see your face.....

(I blackout)
You know I gotta get in
(I blackout)
Just let me in
(Blackout)
You know I gotta get in
But, I gotta know now, where do I fit in?
(Blackout)
You know I gotta get in
(I blackout)
Just let me in
(Blackout)
You know I gotta get in
But, I gotta know now, where do I fit in?
I, I, I
I wanna know now, where do I fit in?
I, I, I (Blackout, I blackout, blackout)
