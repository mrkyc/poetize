Ain't seen your punk-ass around lately
Ain't seen your punk-ass around lately
Pitching from my bag?
Ain't seen your punk-ass around lately
I know I'm really coming to remind you
I've been looking behind you
Cause I know where to find you
What?

Count the days
Don't hold your breath
Chikitee chek 2012
The perpetrator never knew
Never properly represent the struggle
The boy in the bubble is you not Barbarino
My flows unclog your souls like Drano
My logic-tight like Plato
Whoop ass like Kato
With more troops than NATO
Wreckin' your house
Like a tornado in the Barbados
Drop down give props to the third rock
First come first serve shake the spot
See you not so big like you thought you was
Not my blood not my 'cause
Not mi familia
I play like amnesia when I sees ya
Who needs ya
Riding my dick like a skeezah
So, get off me
You might also like
Take a look around
You forgot what you came here for
What's your theory
Why ya try to play that game
You can forget my name
Take a look around
Take a deep breath
Recollect yourself
You a zero
You don't respect yourself
Still running that weak ass game
You can forget my name

Time to bury the bloody hatchet in your
Motherfucking back
I laugh when I hear yo rib cage crack
Breakin you down
Fucking you up like sprack
You always mixin up yo fiction with yo facts
Now I'mma let you know
What the soul for real is
Come correct, let me know what the deal is
Bro, pack your bowl, with my flow
Shit just ain't workin out
No, I'mma have to let you go
Ain't no love no more
Ain't no love no more
Ain't no love no more

Take a look around
You forgot what you came here for
What's your theory
Why ya try to play that game
You can forget my name
Take a look around
Take a deep breath
Recollect yourself
You a zero
You don't respect yourself
Still running that weak ass game
You can forget my name (forget my name)

So, wassup?
Ain't seen your punk ass around lately
Still beating up bitches?
I know I'm really coming to remind you
I've been looking behind
Cause I know where to find you
Ain't no love no more
Ain't no love no more
Ain't no love no more
Yeah
C'mon
C'mon
C'mon, C'mon, C'mon
Take a look around
You forgot what you came here for
What's your theory
Why ya try to play that game
You can forget my name
Take a look around
Take a deep breath
Recollect yourself
You a zero
You don't respect yourself
Still running that weak ass game
You can forget my name

What?
What?
Humpy-dumpty-dy-dump
Hold up
Take a look around

Wha-wha-White boy
You should've known that your ass was banished
Bitch when (bitch when, bitch when, bitch when)
(Bitch when, bitch when, bitch when)
