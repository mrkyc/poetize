Yep
No bother me
Yep
Na, no one can test
And not even one
I'm indestructible

Yeah, I got a vendetta
No, I won't stop
I take 'em down a level
One by one
Imma come down
I never
Let 'em up
To play this song
I live this song
So put 'em up
I'm a dog, I'm a playa
Yeah know what I mean
I'm no chump, I'm a hustla
I got mouths to feed
Imma born American
A natural born killer
Now Imma rude boy
Son I'm a predator
You might also like
Harder they come
Harder they fall
One and all
I wanna see you suffa
Never lay down
Never say die
Never tap out
I wanna see you suffa
You might win some
But you just lost one
I'm the champion
I wanna see you suffa
Harder they come
Harder they fall
One and all
I talk back then let 'em have it

The sun is getting higher
Your on your own
I'm moving back to Zion
I'm going home
And when my job is done
I'll find my place in the sun
And never look back
Inside my Babylon
They keep playing with me
Like every single day
Oh yeah but I got something
To put these haters in their place
Imma born American
A natural born killer
Yeah imma rude boy
Son I'm a predator
Harder they come
Harder they fall
One and all
I wanna see you suffa
Never lay down
Never say die
Never tap out
I wanna see you suffa
You might win some
But you just lost one
I'm the champion
I wanna see you suffa
Harder they come
Harder they fall
One and all
I talk back then let 'em have it

I wanna see you suffa
I'm indestructible
I wanna see you suffa

Harder they come
Harder they fall
One and all
I wanna see you suffa
Never lay down
Never say die
Never tap out
I wanna see you suffa
You might win some
But you just lost one
I'm the champion
I wanna see you suffa
Harder they come
Harder they fall
One and all
I talk back then let 'em have it
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Talk back then let 'em have it
I talk back then let 'em have it
