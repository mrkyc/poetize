Stick then i move
Tryin' to make sense out of nonsense
Fool
Trippin' on life and my situation
Brothers of earth
One love and one nation
I hear the voices callin' me
What? The choices i made were mine
And i don't mind
I rise to the top like cream
Like the phoenix from the blunt ash
Realizin' my dreams
Kissin' the pacific sky
The purple haze brain remains open
To changin' tides
I desire knowledge by nature
Word to aristotle
My nature's not to hate ya
So i try to put myself in the Chucks of the other man
Peace to my brother man
To search out my place in this
World i discovered man
Damn, check out the colors man
My eyes are open
My eyes are open wide
My eyes are open
Yeah, I see it everyday
But some things never change-no
Some people livin' in fear
Not knowin' about the ten dimensions
The (hed) nigga reach the point of awakening
I annihilate niggas who be thinkin' that they can break me
The next brother can do what he want to
This brother's sites are wide and true
If a stupid punk motherfucker sweat me
The trick ass bitch'll wish
He never met me
So be warned my scorn is what you saw here
Be down or be gone
Let's get it on here
Turn of the century
Age of the microwave
One foot on the moon
One foot in the cave
But, you can see it gettin' better
Believe it
Young people sayin' shit "they ain't havin' it"
So now they takin' shit
They breakin' shit
They tired of the status quo
Fittin' to rape yo' shit
Their eyes are open
Their eyes are open wide
Their eyes are open
I see it everyday
So what the fuck
Where you goin'
Where you been
Where you at
If i drop the bomb
Pick it up...
That sexy little girl
She had no father figure
The catholic skirt
Put a hurtin' on her father's ugh
Dress is up all on the daughter's ugh
Table dances-they don't come cheap
D-I-C-K spells "relief"
Bring all your daughters to me
I was a just kid
I was just living
It never ocurred to me that
Skin could determine identity
I was naive you see
I don't give a fuck
Never did never will
Pack skills then move in for the kill
You can't take shit from me
Cause I'm a nigga
Yes I'm a fucking nigga
Yes I'm a nigga
You can't take shit from me
My eyes are open
See my eyes are opening wide
