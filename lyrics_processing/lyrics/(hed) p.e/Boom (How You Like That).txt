Somebody don't know, so that body got burnt
You in the jungle baby, you gon' die
Might as well get fucked, might as well get high
On the real son, I'mma take everything I need, the drugs, the sex, the power
The American dream
I'm a rude, rude boy raised by TV
I laugh at violence, pain and death don't mean shit to me
It's got to be like that
Call me a loser
Yo, I can deal with that
You think you all that, till I lay you on your back, with your legs spread
Ha - Boom! How you like that?
How you like that?
How you like that?
How you like that?
Can you feel me?
How many motherfuckers, just like me
Grew up just like me, fucked up just like me
Wake up, light up, watching BET
Fucking babies mommas from Jersey to Cali
Don't get mad, get high, go get even, go get your shit back
Then tell that lyin' ho you leaving
I smoke weed, I drink wine
Take your daughter to my tour bus and fuck her from behind
You might also likeIt's got to be like that
Call me a loser
Yo, I can deal with that
You think you all that, till I lay you on your back, with your legs spread
Ha - Boom! How you like that?
How you like that?
How you like that?
How you like that?
Can you feel me?
You were never there, when I was down
Like when I needed someone, you were nowhere to be found
I remember the sound of your heartbeat
I remember how you found something good in me
Now I remember how you started fucking with me
You kept fronting on me, always trying to pull something with me
Shit - this ain't no game to me
This shit is life to me, and you ain't living right, baby
It's got to be like that
Call me yo' nigga
I can deal with that
You think you all that, till I lay you on your back, with your legs spread
Ha - Boom! How you like that?
How you like that?
How you like that?
How you like that?
Can you feel me?
