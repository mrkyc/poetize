We used to drive all night
We'd get high all the time
She used to call me all the time
Now she don't
(Please hang up and try again)
She used to call me all the time
We'd go out all the time

You little angel, you look so fine

Why the fuck you fucking with me
Why the fuck you playing with me
Why the fuck you wasting my time
Why the fuck you hiding my sunshine
With friends like you who really needs it
Your smiling face is misplaced, you're so deceiving
I can feel my spirit leaving
I cut my wrists you see them bleeding
Just like a parasite you creeping
See me psychotic, see me jumping off the deep end

She used to call me all the time
Now she don't
She used to call me all the time
We'd go out all the time
But that's over and it's done, but it's all right, oh yeah
Why won't you just leave me alone
Why won't you take your funky ass on home
You got nothing to say that I want to hear
I see through you, baby, you're perfectly clear
Come on, what?
Naw, naw, naw
Naw, baby, naw I ain't mad
What's up? There was a time when we was tight
There was a time when we'd make love and you'd suck my dick like every night
There was a time when I would treat you like you was my queen
But now your pussy dirty like you need Mr. Clean
With friends like you who really needs it
Your smiling face is misplaced, you're so deceiving
I can feel my spirit leaving
I cut my wrists you feel them bleeding
Just like a parasite you creeping
Suffer like the fucking crucifixion
Cover me with dirt, there will be no resurrection
See me psychotic, see me jumping off the deep end
We used to drive all night
We'd get high all the time
She used to call me all the time
Now she don't
She used to call me all the time
We'd go out all the time
You little angel, you look so fine
If I told you how I felt, you would throw it back at me
Your wicked mouth would laugh at me
I hear you laughing at me
Your eyes could never lie to me
Words are all lies to me, it's all lies to me
With friends like you who really needs it
Your smiling face is misplaced, you're so deceiving
I can feel my spirit leaving
You cut my wrists, you feel them bleeding
Just like a parasite you creeping
Baby got me psychotic, got me jumping off the deep end
