You're looking for bounty on another young heart
So young and pretty--does she do it for you
You've got the whole damn world and now you want her too!
You tell her lies and you use her up
Another trophy, welcome to the club
You're always playing with your loaded dice
I'll only tell you once--take my advice--
CHORUS I:
Too much too soon, you got it all so easily
Too much too soon, now somebody put the hurt on me
You're trespassing on my property
If you're looking for her, you've got to go through me
I can tell there's something up your sleeve
Who knows what a young girl believes
You give her money, you promise her the world
A tall story for a small-town girl--
You're so smart, you're always getting your way
Cross that line and you'll have hell to pay
Too much too soon, you got it all so easily
Too much too soon, now somebody put the hurt on me
You're trespassing on my property
If you're looking for her, you've got to go through me
I can tell there's something up your sleeve
Who knows what a young girl believes
You give her money, you promise her the world
A tall story for a small-town girl--
You're so smart, you're always getting your way
Cross that line and you'll have hell to pay
You might also likeYou got me in a squeeze play
You got me in a squeeze play
Too much too soon, you got it all so easily
Too much too soon, now somebody put the hurt on me
You're trespassing on my property
If you're looking for her, you've got to go through me
I can tell there's something up your sleeve
Who knows what a young girl believes
You give her money, you promise her the world
A tall story for a small-town girl--
You're so smart, you're always getting your way
Cross that line and you'll have hell to pay
Too much, too soon, you got it all so easily
Too much too soon, now somebody got the squeeze on me
Too much too soon, you got it all so easily
Too much too soon, now somebody put the hurt on me
You're trespassing on my property
If you're looking for her, you've got to go through me
I can tell there's something up your sleeve
Who knows what a young girl believes
You give her money, you promise her the world
A tall story for a small-town girl--
You're so smart, you're always getting your way
Cross that line and you'll have hell to pay
Too much, too soon, you got it all so easily
Too much too soon, now somebody got the squeeze on me
Too much, too soon, you got it all so easily
