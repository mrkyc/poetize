Well there's a world out there for the takin'
And everything you'll ever need
Now here's the facts, stripped down and naked
If you want it you can get it all for free, yeah
Locked up tight here in the city
With a million other people just like me
Gonna find me some action, I need it now
'Cause right here is the place I wanna be, oh
Don't you tease me baby
Don't you keep me hangin' on
Now as a matter of fact, ain't no mistakin'
I just ain't lookin' for love (I just ain't lookin' for love)
Tell me what's wrong with that, my body's achin'
I just ain't lookin', I just ain't lookin' for love
Love, love, love
Ooh I been burnin' up my time alone
But tonight I'm gonna rock you all night long
And all I need is a little bit of love now baby
Fuck me if you can I can never get enough
