If this could happen to you
Wake up in a dream and everything is coming true
Keeping near the green light
Lady luck's been on my side
Every station in the nation
Plays my song tonight
One more time
'Cause I'm not satisfied
It'll never get much better
Just enjoy the ride!
It's like the boss gave me a raise
No more working holidays
Woke up late and I got laid
Tell me now what wouldn't that be great?
All my bills are paid
The ex found out her boyfriend's gay
You'd think I'd wanna celebrate but I gotta say
It just ain't one of them days
And now the stormy Monday
And I still got the blues
Going nowhere you know I've been there
I'm trying to pay my dues
You might also likeA double shoot of courage
Won't make it go away
But one day baby
One day maybe it could happen to me
It would fell so good
I could be what I want to be
Will it ever get much better
If only I could say
That the boss gave me a raise
No more working holidays
Woke up late and I got laid
Tell me now wouldn't that be great?
All my bills are paid
The ex found out her boyfriend's gay
You'd think I'd wanna celebrate but I got to say
It just ain't one of them days
Do you ever wonder
If this could happen to you
Wake up in a dream and everything is coming true
What if the boss gave me a raise
No more working holidays
Woke up late and I got laid
Tell me now wouldn't that be great?
All my bills are paid
The ex found out her boyfriend's gay
You'd think I'd wanna celebrate
But I gotta say oh yaaa!
No more working holidays
Woke up late and I got laid
But it just ain't one of them days
The boss gave me a raise
No more working holidays
Woke up late and I got laid
