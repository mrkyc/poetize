You wear it well you never let it show
Break into what you can bend
You push your luck to the bitter end
Try to run before you walk
You critize but you can talk
Make believe I don't feel the pain
But here I am going through it again
Well I heard enough, I can't take no more
You knock me down, down to the floor
Now make a choice is do or die
Commit to me and don't ask why
For you, do anything you want me to
For you, do it all over again
For you....doing it all for you baby (tired of waiting)
What's so hard about doing it right
Can it all come down without a fight
Wait for you to pull your share
But it looks to me like you just don't care
For you, do anything you want me to
For you, do it all over again
For you....doing it all for you (tired of waiting) oh you know
You might also likeFor you, I'll be anyone you want me to be
For you, I'll do anything you ask from me
For you....doing it all, doing it all, doing it all baby

Uhh, try to run before you walk
And you critize but baby, you can't talk
Make believe I don't feel the pain
But here we are going through it again
