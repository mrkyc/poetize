It comes to you as no surprise
It's always the same
Every time he's out with you
He tries to tell you what to do
You don't need it that way
Sometimes you think you're playing the fool
He's running around breaking all the rules
Somehow that don't seem fair
There's got to be a better way
You know what I'm trying to say
'Cause deep, deep down inside
You're living in a life in total lies
What did he ever do for you
What's he trying to put you through
I just don't understand
You showed him love and tenderness
Touched him with your sweet caress
Now he's leaving you
So what's the point in working it out
Tell me what it's all about
That's why I'm saying
You might also likeI hope you're with me
I hope you're with me when it's over
I hope you're with me
I hope you're with me when it's over
You won't be lonely
You won't be lonely when it's over
You won't be lonely (you)
When it's over
It's over, it's over, it's over
It's over, it's over, it's over
And in the morning when he's gone
Please don't sing that sad, sad song
I don't want to hear it
Forget about him
Let him go
It won't hurt what he don't know
What's he trying to say to you
What's he trying to tell you
He don't really care
Face the truth and realize
You don't need his alibis
No more
I hope you're with me
I hope you're with me when it's over
I hope you're with me
I hope you're with me when it's over
You won't be lonely
You won't be lonely when it's over
You won't be lonely
You won't be lonely when it's over
It's over, it's over, it's over
