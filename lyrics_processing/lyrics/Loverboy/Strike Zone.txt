You won't get hurt when the damage is done
You tell your self it won't happen to you
It's the same old story there's nothing new
Can't be the one, the one to lose
You won't be wearing someone else's shoes
Can't you read it, it's up on the wall
How can some one so big be so small
(Bridge)
You're nothin' with out your friends
They'll be with you till the bitter end
Your nothin' and you'll find out
What this world is all about
(Chorus)
Standing in the Strike Zone
Runnin' with the pack
Standing in the Strike Zone
Ain't no use in turnin' back
You walk on water, it's the chance you take
Against the odds that the ice won't break
When the sun comes up in the dead of the night
You won't escape from the blinding light
You might also likeFeel the blood running through your veins
See the madness burnin' in their brains
Nowhere to run, no place to hide
We're all alone for that one-way ride
(Bridge)
You're nothin with out your friends
They'll be with you till the bitter end
Your nothin'and you'll find out
What this world is all about
(Chorus)
Standing in the Strike Zone
Runnin' with the pack
Standing in the Strike Zone
Ain't no use in turnin' back
(Chorus)
Standing in the Strike Zone
There's a panic in the streets
Standing in the Strike Zone
Ain't no Bonaparte's Retreat, no
Solo -
BREAKDOWN -
You tell your self you're not the one
You won't get hurt when the damage is done
You tell your self it won't happen to you
It's the same old story there's nothing new
Can't be the one, the one to lose
You won't be wearing someone else's shoes
Can't you read it, it's up on the wall
How can some one so big be so small
(Chorus)
Standing in the Strike Zone
Runnin' with the pack
Standing in the Strike Zone
Ain't no use in turnin' back
(Chorus)
Standing in the Strike Zone
There's a panic in the streets
Standing in the Strike Zone
Ain't no Bonaparte's Retreat
Solo -
(Chorus)
Standing in the Strike Zone
Runnin' with the pack
Standing in the Strike Zone
Ain't no use in turnin' back
(Chorus)
Standing in the Strike Zone
There's a panic in the streets
Standing in the Strike Zone
You got a ticket for a front-row seat
