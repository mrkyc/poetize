Then you can tell me what my next move will be
It's just a matter of time before the whole wide world will see
And when you tell me that I'm wrong
In the morning, I'll be gone
And if you've heard it all before
Then it just don't matter no more
Why don't you tell me what you're after?
Why don't you say what's on your mind?
How will you feel the morning after
When all there is is what I've left behind?
And when you tell me that I'm wrong
In the morning, I'll be gone
And if you've heard it all before
Then it just don't matter no more
It don't matter no more
It don't matter, matter to me
It don't matter no more

And when you tell me that I'm wrong
In the morning, I'll be gone
And if you've heard it all before
Well, it just don't matter no more
