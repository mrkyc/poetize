How can I make you mine?
How can I make you at all if you don't know what goes on inside your mind?
What goes on inside
Don't wanna make you lonely
You need it every day
I wanna make you the only
But you don't know what goes on inside
You're too little, little girl
You're too little, little girl
You're too little, little girl
To fall in love
How can I make you feel it?
And make you lose control?
How can I make you need it when you don't know what goes on inside your mind?
What goes on inside
How can I prove it to you, baby?
You make me wait all day
I'm gonna save it til tomorrow
'Cause you don't know what goes on inside
You're too little, little girl
You're too little, little girl
You're too little, little girl
To fall in love
Little, little girl
You're too little, little girl
You're too little, little girl
To fall in love
