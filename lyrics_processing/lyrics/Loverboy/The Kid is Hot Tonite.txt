And we hope it's here to stay
We'll have to wait and see
If it's half of what they say
We heard he opened up a brand new door
Well, you know that's what I'm looking for
We'll have to wait and see
If it makes you shout for more
How do you like him so far?
How do you like his show?
How do you like the way he rocks and the way he rolls?
How do you like his image?
How do you like his style?
How do you like the way he looks and the way he smiles?
The kid is hot tonite
Whoa, so hot tonite
But where will he be tomorrow?
The kid is hot tonite
Whoa, so hot tonite
But where will he be tomorrow?
And we just heard of a brand new fad
And they say it's gonna drive you mad
We'll have to wait and see
If it's the best you ever had
You might also likeAnd we just heard of a brand new wave
We heard it's heading for an early grave
We'll have to wait and see
If there's anything we can say
How do you like him so far?
How do you like his show?
How do you like the way he rocks and the way he rolls?
How do you like his image?
How do you like his style?
How do you like the way he looks and the way he smiles?
The kid is hot tonite
Whoa, so hot tonite
But tell me, where will he be tomorrow?
The kid is hot tonite
Whoa, so hot tonite
But where will he be tomorrow?
The kid is hot tonite
Whoa, so hot tonite
But where will he be? Where will he be?
The kid is hot tonite
Whoa, so hot tonite
