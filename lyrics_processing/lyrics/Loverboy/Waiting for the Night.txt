Workin' my fingers down to the bone
Tellin' my boss where to get off
S'like tryna squeeze blood from a stone
So cut me a piece of the American Pie
Everyday around noon
When the clock strikes one
My backs to the sun
Someone pours salt in the wound
Waiting for the night
Yeah we're waiting for the night to fall
'Cause the night time is the right time
And we're waiting for the night to fall
Well it's all in a day's work
Everybody says
Don't bite the hand that feeds ya
Take the bitter with the sweet
The bull by the horn
Don't lead me out to pasture
Well someone's gotta say it
And I'm proud to be the one
We're just looking for a good time
And you know what they say
Overworked and underpaid
There's got to be a better way

Yeah we're waiting for the night to fall
'Cause the night time is the right time
And we're waiting for the night to fall
There's a better way
Than workin' everyday
When the tax man comes
And takes it all away
We can make it work
And we can make it pay
We're waiting for the night to fall
Workin' our lives away
So cut me a slice of the American Pie
Everyday around noon
When the clock strikes one
My backs to the sun
Someone pours salt in the wound
Waiting for the night
Yeah we're waiting for the night to fall
'Cause the night time is the right time
And we're waiting for the night to fall
Now work it!
Now we can make it work
And we can make it pay
We're waiting for the night to fall
Workin' our lives away
We can make it work
And we can make it pay
We're waiting for the night to fall
Workin' our lives away
Woah!
