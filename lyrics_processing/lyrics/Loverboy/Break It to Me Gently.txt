But are you looking at me, 'cause you know things aren't what they seem to be
Does it matter to you, or have you played that game before
I can feel you across the room, I wanna know just what it takes
'Cause you know that I've made some mistakes, I've been down that road before
Don't want to feel like a wolf when I'm banging on your door
So, break it to me gently all night long
Break it to me gently or prove me wrong
Take me to the point of no return, oh yeah
Break it to me gently all night long
All night long
So tell me if I'm wrong
But wasn't it you that gave up without a fight, last night
So tell me if I'm reading you right
That's when I felt that there was something going on
And now I know what I wanna see
When you walk that way, do you talk that way for me
Gotta know, or are you just putting on a show
Cause you're everything I want and a little bit more
So, break it to me gently all night long
Break it to me gently or prove me wrong
Take me to the point of no return, oh yeah
Break it to me gently all night long
All night long

So, break it to me gently all night long
Break it to me gently or prove me wrong
Take me to the point of no return, oh yeah
Break it to me gently all night long
All night long
So, break it to me gently all night long
Break it to me gently or prove me wrong
Take me to the point of no return, oh yeah
Break it to me gently all night long
