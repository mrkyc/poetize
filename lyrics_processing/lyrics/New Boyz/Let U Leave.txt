I know you mad 'cause you caught me with a jump-off, jump-off walking out my room
Would've said it ain't what it seem, but if we switched places, I'd feel the same way too (Ain't gon' let you leave)
Baby girl I promise (Ain't gon' let you leave)
That it ain't what it look like (Ain't gon' let you leave)
I'm just tryna be honest (Ain't gon' let you leave)
Baby it was just one night

Hey, I had a girlfriend
I finally settled down
She gave her all to me, seven pounds
She had a boyfriend
Who' career was rappin'
He gave his all to her
Unless a girl distract him
I ain't even wanna go sex her
But, I mean the girl kept on blowin' my texts up
Like "Legacy, come over, you're girlfriend cockblocking"
And she had food can't turn down a Hot Pocket
I guess my actions led to your packin'
I know you walked in, but I swear it didn't happen
How yo' brain processed it to be
I tried to run from her, but she wasn't lettin' me be
See, what happened was she put pills in my cup
Threw my clothes in the tub and went down as I slept
Wait, where you goin'? Baby calm down
Okay, I lied to you, but before you walk out
You might also like
I know you mad 'cause you caught me with a jump-off, jump-off walking out my room
Would've said it ain't what it seem, but if we switched places, I'd feel the same way too (Ain't gon' let you leave)
Baby girl I promise (Ain't gon' let you leave)
That it ain't what it look like (Ain't gon' let you leave)
I'm just tryna be honest (Ain't gon' let you leave)
Baby it was just one night

Look, I know I'm wrong for the things I've done
I passed up a couple chances because I'm sprung
We've been together for four months, you pushed my buttons
Can't forgive it, lil daddy, girl I messed up once
I don't like her, she was a one-nighter
If ending love was a girl we can both fight her
Of course bro I like her, I was 'bout to wife her
If she don't let me go then yeah I'm gon' wife her
L-O-L, I'ma send her as a text
Talkin' 'bout I miss you, baby what's up next?
And if you don't get back, I'ma call her up next
Let her know I love her; have to say what's on my chest
I didn't do it yet, but I'ma still count seconds
And if I get my girl back, then I got all my blessings
Grab the iPhone and the server started ringing
And she picked up the phone, look baby I was thinking
I know you mad 'cause you caught me with a jump-off, jump-off walking out my room
Would've said it ain't what it seem, but if we switched places, I'd feel the same way too (Ain't gon' let you leave)
Baby girl I promise (Ain't gon' let you leave)
