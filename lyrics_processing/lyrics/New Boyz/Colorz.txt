Damn I got colors that ain't even on the rainbow
Damn I got colors that ain't even on the rainbow
Damn I got colors that ain't even on the rainbow
Dudes think their fresh but we ain't even on the same boat

My style is so retro
S o fresh yo
I got the best cloth
You still rocking Echo
Like yodels I am lethal
Lethal weapon
Speak so f'in great
I am flyer then the eagles
People listen New Boyz is skytop
Chilling with a boom box and tube socks on my block
Which is the international fly curve
I feed so many fly things
I can even bite birds
My word
And the haters get mean
I keep my shit toke
But the lace is still skinny
I got plenty
Girls maybe 10 at a few
And I'm never blushing
Let my gear shatter proof
I am fly
Like legend was an insect
Only messin friends and family
No incest
Colors ain't a rainbow no homo
We flawless
Them leprechauns where the pot of gold is in my closet

Too fresh
You know I rock the proper stuff
Its Ben J and I'm cleaner then a doctors glove
A lot of love I get from the block and stuff
And you can say I pack haters
Cause I box them up
I'm hot and stuff
The sun gives me lots of love
And I ain't stepping on snails
But I'm Poppin slug
Naww I'm playin
I'm just saying its a lot of bloods
Who ain't afraid to kill a soul
Like the locked up thug
But back to the point
Me I got them chopper colors
Like the kitchen of a fanta lover
The hood love me
Even got the suburbs yo
On my team so you need a lot others yo
Damn I got colors that ain't even on the rainbow
You ain't changing nothing like you sleeping with the same ho
Everybody wanna watch the New Boyz style
Even the Cool Kidz wanna be the New Boyz now
Damn I got colors that ain't even on the rainbow
Damn I got colors that ain't even on the rainbow
Damn I got colors that ain't even on the rainbow
Dudes think their fresh but we ain't even on the same boat
Damn I got colors that ain't even on the rainbow
