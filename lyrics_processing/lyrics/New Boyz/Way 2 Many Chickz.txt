I have way too many choices
I got way too many chicks
Ay bro (whattup?) I got way too many chicks
(Damn! I got that too)
Oh f'real? (Yup) - Way too many chicks
Aight, ay let me tell you this story real quick aight bruh?
(Fo' sho') Check it out ay

I met this girl named Chanelle, from A-T-L
An actress and a singer, she was paid in mills
We first spoke, thought I found a bad chick on the spot
'til I noticed that her breath smelled like fat kids in a box
I knew this girl named Jill, who wanted my baby
I always told her no but I ain't know she was crazy
I was in there had to bust, I was like "Wait Jill!"
She put a gun to my head and was like {STAY STILL}
Met this girl named Laniece, a freak but ugly
Stripped for me once and her butt cheeks was musty
Every time it got loud she would sneak a small fart
Chick passed so much gas she could make a car start
Knew this chick named Shirley, she acted so perky
But little did I know that the chick had herpes
Tried to kiss me in my sleep I got up and screamed
Chick had a cold sore that looked like John McCain
Now I'm sittin on my couch and I'm thinkin how to get
To the point where I can't even get a decent soundin chick
One more try to holla I'mma mace 'em in their lip
I never thought it'd be bad that I got way too many chicks

But if I had a dollar for the good ones I wouldn't make shit

I met this one chick, named Miley Jets
I was so fascinated by Miley's breasts
She said she had a gift, it was probably sex
But when she took her wig off she looked like Kanye West
I met this girl named Tiqa she was not no groupie
She was a black belt, starred in kung-fu moviess
I liked her but I had to dump her on the second date
Cause every time she moved her mouth her words would come a second late
I met this chick name Yvette who was into sex
Got her naked in an hour then we hit the bed
She was twitchin so much like she had the best
I found out the real reason cuz she had Tourette's (God damn!)
I met this one teacher named, Mrs. Chandelier
She was so bomb that I was skippin lunch to see her
'til she snuck up from behind me and I kicked her out of fear
Sounded like Ja Rule was tryin to whisper in my ear
Now I'm sittin on my couch and I'm thinkin how to get
To the point where I can't even get a decent soundin chick
One more try to holla I'mma mace 'em in their lip
I never thought it'd be bad that I got way too many chicks
