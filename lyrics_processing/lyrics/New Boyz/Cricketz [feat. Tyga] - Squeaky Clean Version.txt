I remember when Pharell
Used to rock the tight jeans
With ice creams
While ridin' his skateboard
It was like sight seein'
Too lame he was afraid to change
If my middle finger could speak
Then I'd say the same
Nigga I'd state my name
Call me legacy bitch
Mrs. Sweetheart
A.K.A. let me see tits
Doin' too much like a marvel back flip
Jeans stay skinny like I starve my fabric
Where the haters at? Heller I found you
No, I don't give a F word about you
ITune me, leave us alone
Why don't you do you & go help a clone
Get it? Hey, another damn thing
You'll never see me care about another man's jeans
I don't even know, like all through the years
Seem like everywhere I go
The only thing that I hear is...
Na, Na, Na, Na, New Boyz
Na, Na, Na, Na, Tight Jeans
Na, Na, Na, Na, New Boyz
Na, Na, Na, Na, Tight Jeans
Oh my God, why they jeans so tight?
Oh my, oh my, Oh my God, why they jeans so tight?

Why y'all niggas hatin' on my skinny jeans
Fresh kicks like I copped a magician
You must be missin'
The simple fact that I'm a get it
You ain't with it, baggy clothin' outfits
Brothers actin' stiff like cactus
Comin' off hard but they soft like fabric
They lying, saying they the best like Calvin
They chose me, it's obvious I'm meant for the best
Skinny jeans sag low &

Tight jeans, naw nigga, I don't get hyphy
So you think you can dance in those fake nikes?
Lock yo' old ass down, lil' Ryan icey

Don't do signs do check signings
Tyga Towmry, I'm what the power what the diamonds
The fame will blind ya

See no evil, be low than 0's
More funds to free throw
House got the strip pole
Skinny jeans at the door, girls got the speedos

New boys with new dough
Other nigga's brunos
Homey's with homos
