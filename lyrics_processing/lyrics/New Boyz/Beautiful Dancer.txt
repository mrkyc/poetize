You see you're more than beautiful
There is no metaphor
That can describe what my eyes see
So don't you take this personal
But had to let you know that
There's just one thing I came to see
So won't you bounce it up and down
B-bounce it up and down
Bounce it up and down for me
So won't you bounce it up and down
B-bounce it up and down
Bounce it up and down for me
I don't mean to seem disrespectful
But I've been looking at your hips and felt so
Curious about what they can do
It's stuck in my head and I can't seem to let go
Gimme wrong I can more than respect plan
You work hard and look better than the rest of 'em
Love how you carry yourself in the birthday suit
Make me wanna drop a bill and write a check for you
I make you my personal assistant
Take you on the road hit spot straight business
Take you to a private spot
Check in at the hotel resort and spa
Don't worry about a budget
I afford a lot fly
You need a passport to shop
But before I make you hotter then ???
What's good
You might also like
You can bounce it up and down
Stun it girl dance it around
She haven't made a sound
She tired, lay her body down
Swagging it out while
I play music at her house
We chilling out
She giving lap dances on the couch
Dancing and she feeling it
She vibes like she into it
She wanna make a movie
Well I guess I will be filming it
Like she the type to get it shaking
Early morning, waken bacon
She pop it when she naked
She offer then I take it

I know you were never used to love
But I swear
I swear your love was meant for me
Girl you're so beautiful
You were made for me
And it won't be long
Girl I'm gonna take you home with me
Oh
You see you're more than beautiful
There is no metaphor
That can describe what my eyes see
So don't you take this personal
But had to let you know that
There's just one thing I came to see
So won't you bounce it up and down (Bounce it up and down)
B-bounce it up and down (Bounce it up and down)
Bounce it up and down for me
So won't you bounce it up and down (Do we)
B-bounce it up and down (Do we)
