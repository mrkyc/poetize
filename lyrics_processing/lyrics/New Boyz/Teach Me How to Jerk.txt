Now when it come to the jerk
We got the potion
They see the push
And leave they circles open
I'm rejectin' it might leave my back broken
Now tell me if you can jerk in slow motion
Like this, you know that my team's sick
I'm sure you see my whole squad with them clean whips
Now watch me clean dip
You see the clean kicks
Try to jerk like me
I guarantee it'll leave your jeans ripped
Pause, drop, go, stop
I let my chain bang, gang swang, go watch
Girls tell me when I jerk I look so hot
Cause' I be jerkin' like I'm tryna
Make the boat rock
We killin' the game but we hurt in the street
They say that push on fire
We work in the heat
So if ya tryna do the dance
Work with your feet
Rock slow, drop low, and jerk to the beat like
You might also like

I just need ya to
Ok, hi I'm him
Hair hang low right up under my brim
We are them guys not concerned bout wind
It's your time to jerk with them lights on dim
And all u other dudes keep it on u
I pose for the camera
I'm a let em' getta view
The ladies always love it when I'm doin' what I do
They be sayin' Oktane you just jerk so cute
Ok, I just say thanks and my chain
They try to grab it
Wanna copy the jerk, go ahead, you can have it
Dolla rockin be nice
And we ain't really braggin
But stuntin is just natural
Jerkin' is the habit
Yeah I'm the reason that ya chick make you wanna curse
She all up on ya boy
Cause she hear me on this verse
The ladies give me room
Cause they see me when I work
And when I'm done
They be askin can you teach me how to jerk?

Jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk, jerk
