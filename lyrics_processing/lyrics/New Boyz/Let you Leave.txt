I know you mad cause you caught me with a jump-off, jump-off walking out my room
Would've said it ain't what it seem, but if we switched places, I'd feel the same way too (Ain't going let you leave)
Baby girl I promise (Ain't going let you leave)
That it ain't what it look like (Ain't going let you leave)
I'm just tryna be honest (Ain't going let you leave)
Baby it was just one night

I had a girlfriend, I finally settled down
She gave her heart to me, seven pounds
She had a boyfriend, who career was rappin
He gave his heart to her, unless a girl distracts him
I-I ain't even wanna go sexing her but
I mean the girl kept on blowin my text up
Like "Legacy, come over, your girlfriend cockblockin"
And she had food can't turn down a Hot Pocket
I guess my actions led to your packin
I know you walked in but I swear it didn't happen
How your brain processed it to be
I tried to run from her but she wasn't lettin me be
See, what happened was she put pills in my cup
Threw my clothes in the tub and went down as I slept
Wait, where you going? Baby calm down
Okay, I lied to you, but before you walk out

Look, I know I'm wrong for the things I done
I passed up a couple of chances because I'm sprung
We've been together for four months, she pushed my buttons
Can't forgive it little daddy girl I messed up once, haha
I don't like her, she was a one nighter
If endin love was a girl, we can both fight her
Of course bro I like her, I was about to wife her
If she don't let me go then yeah, I'm going wife her
LOL, I'mma send her ass a text
Talking about "I miss you baby what's up next?"
And if you don't get back I'mma call her up next
Let her know I love her have to say what's on my chest
I didn't do it yet, but I'mma still count seconds
And if I get my girl back then I got all my blessings
Grabbed the iPhone and the service started ringing
And she picked up the phone "Look baby I was thinkin"
