She said it's funny how these young boys killing her
And they ain't got that long stroke, so I Reggie Miller'd her
She put it in my face I'ma eat that hungry
Made her come so many times she needed gas money
Girl, I fetus that tummy, all up in it
Got a tight grip so I never fall up in it
Michael Myers killing the kitty, I think I kinda like her
And her body blazing, I got her wetter than a fire fighter
Ain't no off switch for me, it's like a tattoo
Girl, I'm a beast on the half moon
I am iller than it may seem, they all say that I'm amazing
When I'm in there she be shaking, it's like making love to Haiti
And she all up in my head like an mp3
Then I hit it hit it hit it like an MPC
Based on that plot she give me 2 thumbs down before she test it
But the climax was epic

I felt that 100 lil' mama like to get it
She like it when I hit that g spot, come and kick it
I put it down and spin her body like the ones and twos
We going hard knocking boots like it's 92
Looking in her eyes, hands strolling up against her thighs
Thinking bout 'Becky' cause the radio just played Plies
Now my song is on and she getting her orgasm on
Taking over the stage and speak into my microphone
Baby get it wet like I just fell in a river
This skinny nigga hungry your body is for dinner
And then I go dddd... to sleep
And you don't hear nothing but that private water leak
Sounds good don't, it yea you messing with some freaks
That you down and you see that your a legend from the beasts
Got a jungle in my room, take a journey through my sheets
Got you feeling so good, climaxing to the beats

And all my ATL girls put your hands up
And if you like it like that I can do it like that

And all my New York girls put your hands up
