She had a apple bottom, skinny waist
Shake them buns all in my face
Five-six, super freak
Tell all the homies that she got
Buns, buns buns (said she got)
Buns, buns buns (sh-she got)
Buns, buns buns (said she got)

I like big buns and I can not lie
So if you got some and I see you walk by
I'm a get up, tap you, say hi
Take you to my room, tap you, then bye
Nah I'm just playin (You still got buns)
But your friend need to stop cause she ain't got none
I like my buns fat and juicy
I don't want no saggy booty
Tryin to do me not, you can stop
I ain't touchin nuttin less the booty pop
Got a milli' like bank cause I handle cake
If you ain't got money better fly that away
Tell Wolf Pack that a chick need a change
Booty bounce proper, my chick bounce lame
It keeps goin got too much fuel
She don't got a donk, this girl got a mule

Shake it super hard boy you better not run
Poppin those buns like her booty is a gun
Probably had buns since the day she was one
Buns so big that'll block out the sun
Can't take two, Wolf pass me one
This the New Boys and we all have fun
Kydd leave the club but befo' we was done
She bought me a drink and we both got drunk
Now we at the crib, we both throwin up
But it's all good cause she still wanna hump
Then I bang bang bang 'til the sun came up
Hit the New Boys, said "Come pick me up!"
They pulled up to the front then I hopped in the trunk
Then I told a story 'bout the girl with the buns
She had a apple bottom, skinny waist
Shake them buns all in my face
