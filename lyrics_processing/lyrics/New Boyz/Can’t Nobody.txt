Yeah, can't nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody baby, can't nobody
Nobody, nobody, oohh nobody baby

She the reason why my clothes stay pressed
While I pack and go
And she the only one at the airport
When I'm back from the road
Took me home
Two ribs on the stove
My favorite how you know?
Hit the couch and she already had the game on
Tivo cause it ended hours ago
She screamed when kobe hit the game winning jumper
Ran through the house like a playground in summer
She wrapped her legs around me and I spunned
Kissed her forehead and said that I love her
She ran the water for me got down in the lingerie
And said that she gon model for me
Perfect way to start the day

I don't think anybody made
You the only who got it made
Like everytime I see you
Our love gets stronger by the days
Take you to different states
Every day a different place
You never heard or seen that race
I'm different people different faces
You wanna be kind
Mommy you mine
I get to work like overtime
I'm past that up high
I know you wanna meet someone who you can fit
And so I step up to the plate
Home runnin' shit

Yeah, can't nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody baby, can't nobody

You can try something new if you want to
If you want to oooh
And baby you can go
If you think this is ain't where you
Baby where you should be
But don't nobody know you like me
If it takes that for you to see
Than baby you can go
But like I said before, can't nobody

Who gon', who gon', who gon' love you better than me?
