Zonin'
New Boyz
Zonin', zonin'

Like damn, I don't really like to argue
Think it's pointless, but you like to start too
Like I heard this, she said that
And my friends told me they must be facts
Here we go with this stuff again
Like you just met these girls and you trustin' them?
She put it on me, screamin' so loud
That I'm left with no choice but to tune her out
(Stupid mothefucker) I love you too, you workin' out, girl? I love them shoes!
Yeah I love you too, if that's what I do
Plus I like when your mad, I think its so cute
I shut her up by the compliments
That's really the only way I can stop the fits
So every time she start yellin' In here
I close my eyes and put my hands in my ears like...

Na na na na (say what?)
Na na na na na na (I can't hear you!)
Na na na na (what's that?)
Na na na na na na (I-I can't hear you!)
I swear it's like you talkin to a wall
Cause I ain't listen to you at all
But you keep tryna talk talk talk
But wah wah wah
But talk all the shit you want
I be zonin' you out
You might also like
Same ol' pointless name shit about how you disappear
I be zonin' you out
You talkin' like it's the end of the world
When you ain't got shit to say
Z-zonin'
Get out my ear, out my ear, out my ear
I be zonin' you out
You in my ear, in my ear, in my ear (zonin')
I be zonin' you out

Damn get out my ear though
Got these old folks lookin at us like weirdo's
Can we jus sit & talk about it?
Instead of you tryna tell ya pops about It
You don't needa go that far, it's just me & you
Your daddy to old what that nigga gon' do?
Oops my bad, you know I ain't mean It
What I'm tryna say is we needa quit beefin'
She smiled at me and said "Your right, but who was that girl you was with last night?"
She started going off like burnt lights
At this rate we never gon work right
That's when I planned somethin' different
The only way to deal with her is to not listen
So I put my hands on my ear till she stopped trippin like..
Na na na na (say what?)
Na na na na na na (I can't hear you!)
Na na na na (what's that?)
Na na na na na na (I-I can't hear you!)
I swear it's like you talkin to a wall
Cause I ain't listen to you at all
But you keep tryna talk talk talk
But wah wah wah
But talk all the shit you want
I be zonin' you out

Same ol' pointless name shit about how you disappear
I be zonin' you out
You talkin' like it's the end of the world
When you ain't got shit to say
Z-zonin'
Get out my ear, out my ear, out my ear
I be zonin' you out
You in my ear, in my ear, in my ear (zonin')
I be zonin' you out (zonin' you out)

Seem like all you want is for me to hear your voice (hear your voice)
Even if all the things you say is true, there's still no point (still no point)
For you to be trippin' like you are, it ain't that bad
I even left my ex girl for you and she ain't that mad
Here we go again, here we go again with the same damn argument
I don't know the chick, I don't know the chick, will you please get off my head?
Think about all the times that you find out a lie just to bring you down
Your way too loud, if you gon' try and shout
Then ill be zonin' you out like..
Na na na na (say what?)
Na na na na na na (I can't hear you!)
Na na na na (what's that?)
Na na na na na na (I-I can't hear you!)
I swear it's like you talkin to a wall
Cause I ain't listen to you at all
But you keep tryna talk talk talk
But wah wah wah
But talk all the shit you want
I be zonin' you out

Same ol' pointless name shit about how you disappear
I be zonin' you out
You talkin' like it's the end of the world
When you ain't got shit to say
Z-zonin'
Get out my ear, out my ear, out my ear
I be zonin' you out
You in my ear, in my ear, in my ear (zonin')
