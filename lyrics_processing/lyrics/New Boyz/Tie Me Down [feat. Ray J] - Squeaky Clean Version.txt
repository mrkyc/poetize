She ain't gon' Tie Me Down
She ain't gon' Tie Me Down

'Cause She ain't gon' Tie Me Down
Why you on the road?
Buyin' all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes
What you want right now
What up right now
I think you need to close yo' mouth
'Cause you ain't gon' Tie Me Down, Tie Me Down, Tie Me Down
You ain't gon' Tie Me Down

You know we been together for a minute
But a, it's kinda been forever since we been in
The kinda situation not involvin' other women
& it's pretty obvious that your kinda trippin' like
"Who the hell is this bitch lookin' a hot mess
What you fell for this chick"
You know we got problems & you failed to fix it
I'm like "You need to go somewhere else with this shit
'Cause I ain't gon' put up with you
Talkin' 'about how she make you uncomfortable
I mean, shit I'm only 17
& um, a perfect couples only in a dream
& right now I'm pretty much away for this relationship
I think we should wait for it
I mean later we can try things out
But not right now

Ha, Ha
Aye girl waddup?
No I'm not gon' make a scene
Buh you can't tie me down like a pair of shoe strings
Yeah you cute, so what
But let's get it through your head
Yeah we make love, sex weed all in the bed
It's the best & I love her but things don't change
When I'm not faithful you be feelin' my pain
Now you stuck like a stain & I can't believe that
Baby girl 100, I ain't tryin' to do that
Got too many girls & I ain't lettin' go
'Cause my life is great & you ain't nothin' but a hoe
Yeah you come to my shows & you very supportive
Just showed me a camera & my show recorded
It was nice, I'm surprised that you still standin' here
As you know I'm a man & I have no feelings
I'm a start from the top, girl this ain't no lovin'
I'm a New Boy, girl so

No you just can't Tie Me Down
Today is not the day
It ain't not okay
Never gonna tie me, tie me
Never ever Tie Me Down

'Cause She ain't gon' Tie Me Down
Why you by the road?
You can buy all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes
That's you want right now
But I'm like naw
