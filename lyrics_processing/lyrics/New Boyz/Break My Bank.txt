She make me wanna break my bank (my bank)

Shawty wanna break my, shawty wanna break my bank

Damn - girl! You look better than the videos
Think I wanna break my bank, hammer to the piggy though
All-all the groupie girls gettin jealous of what I spend
They tryin to chop it up, but I ain't The Karate Kid
Jaden! Everyday I'm spendin' more on her
I don't buy shit, like I barely hold the door open
Every time I say this shit I always get her one more
When it's time for taxes, a nigga gon' be done for

Okay, the start of my day, I took her on a date
Had to scrape for some change, so I went to the bank
But when I seen her she was so damn fine like that
So I headed right back to pull a lot more stacks
Overdrawn, low funds, it's-it's like I'm dumb
But I'll put it right back cause your boy is sprung
Man she is so damn fine got me spendin all this cash
Man it's goin too fast, I need to watch my ass

Make me wanna break my
Make me wanna break my bank

If you a bad girl, and you need a little change
Tell your man go break his bank (go break yo' bank!)
If you a bad girl, and you tryin to get paid
Tell your man go break his bank (go-go break yo' bank!)
If you a bad girl, and you need a little change
Tell your man go break his bank (go break yo' bank!)
If you a bad girl, and you tryin to get paid
Tell your man go break his bank (go-go break yo' bank!)
