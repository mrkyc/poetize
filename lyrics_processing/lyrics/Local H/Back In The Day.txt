Well, punk is dead
And, yeah, you're next
But it seems no one has told you yet
So hardcore
You must be sore
You come on like a major threat

Face, I know you like it hard 'n' straight
Face, think I'll hang around and wait, wait, wait, wait

Hey old school
Yeah you were cool
But that was back in the day
Yeah that was back in the day
Hey old school
Yeah you were cool
But that was back in the day
Yeah that was back in the day

Well take a bow
Harder than thou
You scream, "Guilty" like a judge on high
Well beat them back
The new jacks
More than music it's a way of life
You might also like
Face, I know you like it hard 'n' straight
Face, think I'll hang around and wait, wait, wait, wait

Hey old school
Yeah you were cool
But that was back in the day
Yeah that was back in the day
Hey old school
Yeah you were cool
But that was back in the day
Yeah that was back in the day
Hey old school
Yeah you were cool
But that was back in the day
Yeah that was back in the day
Hey old school
Yeah you were cool
But that was back in the day
Yeah that was back in the day


Hey old school
Yeah you were cool
But that was back in the day
Yeah that was back in the day
Hey old school
Yeah you were cool
But that was back in the day
Yeah that was back in the day
Hey old school
Yeah you were cool
But that was back in the day
Yeah that was back in the day
Hey old school
Yeah you were cool
But that was back in the day
Yeah that was back in the day
Yeah!
