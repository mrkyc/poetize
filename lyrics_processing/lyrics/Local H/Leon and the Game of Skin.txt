To bend the world your way
It's over, it's over
Leon, it's over
Another doctored take
Another narrative shaped
It's over, it's over
Leon, it's over
It's over, it's over
Leon, it's over
When the buyers beware
The sellars don't care
The sun burns in the tower
The unquenchable thirst
Of who was here first
The richest doubt will cower
So where's your skin in the game
Leon leaves the light on
And Leon takes the bait
And what we all decide on
Is one more baby betrayed
And Leon leads to follow
So where's your skin in the game
In the game
In the game
You might also likeAnd now you're back to one
No worth in what you've done
It's over, it's over
Leon, it's over
Another altered state
Another fault degrades
It's over, it's over
Leon, it's over
It's over, it's over
It's over, it's over
While they're faking a rage
While they disengage
There's pipers in the powers
The low hanging fruit
We all follow suit
Devoured by the power
And where's your skin in the game
And Leon leaves the light on
And Leon makes the trade
What we all decide on
Is one more baby betrayed
And Leon leaves tomorrow
So where's your skin in the game
In the game
In the game
Leon leaves the light on
And Leon takes the bait
What we all decide on
Is one more baby betrayed
And Leon leads to follow
So where's your skin in the game
And Leon leaves tomorrow
So where's your skin in the game
And we all leave the light on
And we all make the trade
What we can't decide on
Is one more baby betrayed
And we all lead to follow
So where's your skin in the game
In the game
