Born to be down
I've learned all my lessons before now
Born to be down
I think you'll get used to it

And you just don't get it, you keep it copacetic
And you learn to accept it, you know it's so pathetic
And you just don't get it, you keep it copacetic
And you learn to accept it, you know it's so pathetic

And you don't
And you don't
And you don't
And you don't

Born to be down
I think that I've said this before now
Born to be down
What good is confidence?

And you just don't get it, you keep it copacetic
And you learn to accept it, you know it's so pathetic
And you just don't get it, you keep it copacetic
And you learn to accept it, you know it's so pathetic
