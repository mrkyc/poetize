Won't you lay your hands on me?
Mirror my melody
Transfer my tragedy
Got a curse I cannot lift
Shines when the sunset shifts
When the moon is round and full
Gotta bust that box, gotta gut that fish
My mind's a flame
We could jet in a stolen car
But I bet we wouldn't get too far
'Fore the transformation takes
And bloodlust tanks and crave gets slaked
My mind has changed
My body's frail but God, I like it
My heart's a flame
My body's strained but God, I like it
My mind has changed
My body's frail but God, I like it
My heart's a flame
My body's strained but God, I like it
You might also likeCharge me your day rate
I'll turn you out in kind
When the moon is round and full
Gonna teach you tricks that'll blow your mongrel mind
Baby doll, I'll recognize
You're a hideous thing inside
If ever there were a lucky kind
It's you, you, you, you
I know it's strange another way to get to know you
You'll never know unless we go, so let me show you
I know it's strange another way to get to know you
We've got till noon, here comes the moon
So let it show you, show you now
Dream me, oh dreamer, down to the floor
Open your arms and let them weave on yours
Feel me, completer, down to my core
Open your heart and let it bleed on yours
Feeding on fever, down on all fours
Show you what all that howl is for
Hey, hey, my playmate
Let me lay waste to thee
Burned down their hanging trees
It's hot here, hot here, hot here, hot here
(We're howling forever, oh, oh)
Got a curse we cannot lift
Shines when the sunshine shifts
(We're howling forever, oh, oh)
There's a cure that comes with a kiss
The bite that binds, the gift that gives
(We're howling forever, oh, oh)
Now that we got gone for good
Writhing under your riding hood
(We're howling forever, oh, oh)
Tell your grandma and your mama too
It's true, true, true
We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever (x5)
We're howling (x8)
We're howling forever (x2)
We're howling
We're howling forever
We're howling forever
