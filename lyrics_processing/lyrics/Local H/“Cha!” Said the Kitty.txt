Sucking like a crack hack
Feeling like an 8-track
Out of whack
All the times a clucking no
A suck it and a suck it

I don't want to live with that
And you don't want to take it back
And I don't want to be a rat
And you don't want a kitty cat

Reaching for the phone ring
Settle for the chump change
Settle down
Make it like a godsend
Feeling like a has-been
Remember when
All the times a clucking no
A suck it and a suck it
All the times a clucking no
A suck it and a suck it

I don't want to live with that
And you don't want to take it back
And I don't want to be a rat
And you don't want a kitty cat

I don't want to live with that
And you don't want to take it back
And I don't want to be a rat
And you don't want, don't want, don't want...


I don't want to live with that
And you don't want to take it back
And I don't want to be a rat
And you don't want a kitty cat
I don't want to live with that
And you don't want to take it back
And I don't want to be a rat
And you don't want a kitty cat
I don't want to live with that
And you don't want to take it back
And I don't want to be a rat
And you don't want a kitty cat

I don't want to live with that
I don't want to live with that
I don't want to live with that
And you don't want a kitty cat
You don't want a kitty cat
You don't want a kitty cat
I don't want a kitty cat
