Well, I got your late night call
You're in the center of it all
You're havin' a ball
And you're really doin' fine
A west coast time
And I believe you

But here's one for the coast
The people with the most
The pretty, pretty folks
The west coast folks
Yeah, here's one for the coast
The people with the most
The pretty, pretty folks
The west coast folks

Well here we go again
It's never gonna end
We're all so sick of California songs!
Yeah we know you love LA
There's nothing left to say
Please, no more California songs!

Just more shit that I don't buy

They're movin' out in droves
They're sending back reports on the radio
Yeah nothing here's the same
It's getting pretty lame
"California Dreamin's" on the radio

And here we go again
It's never gonna end
We're all so sick of California songs!
Yeah we know you love LA
There's nothing left to say
Please, no more California songs!
