Take your pride and eat it
Crawl back beaten
Sources are depleated
Can you take the final hit and admit that you were wrong?
Dont even call it even
Bleedin' is beliving
Former well-being
We're closing for the season
Can you take the final hit and admit that you don't belong?
Beaten 6 ways to Sunday
Beaten 6 ways to Sunday now
You're gonna have to leave it
You know you'll never need it
Wait til you see what we've planned for you
And its heinous
So come on, come on comeupins
You really are the star of the show right now
It's an estrangement
Kinda strange when cliche's are true
Beaten 6 ways to Sunday
Beaten 6 ways to Sunday now
And I am sorry to enjoy this
But, what would you have me do?
What would you have me do?
You might also likeCan you just go home hated
Half intoxicated
Hopelessly outdated
And not appreciated
Can you take the final blow and know that you fucked up?
Go state the overstated
Keep it complicated
The over educated
That hope you'll never make it
Can you take the final blow and know they won't be shutting up?

Baby's outta town but I see the light on
What are you up to now?
Headin' for the gun, I can see rock bottom
No one will help you now
Beaten 6 ways to Sunday
Beaten 6 ways to Sunday now
Gonna have to leave it
You know you'll never need it
Everything has been cut and dried for you
And its heinous
So come on, come on comeupins

===================
Hold tight
It's New years Eve
It will be cold tonight
Kill the heat
And shut out all the lights
And cut the phone line too
Alright
We don't need nothing but cyanide
Pulled out teeth won't be identified
What would you have me do?
You got it
Hold tight
It's New years Eve
It will be cold tonight
Kill the heat
And shut out all the lights
And cut the phone line too
