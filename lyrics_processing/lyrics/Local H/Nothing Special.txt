A one-trick pony in a one-horse town
You're feeling lonely and the cable's down
You feel like the only freak in this town
What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you?

What's wrong with me?

We've got a life of scratching tickets
At the local gas and stop
So suck another whip-it
And hear the brain cells pop

I know I'm nothing special
And I know I'm nothing great
I know I'm nothing different
But I just don't feel the same

What's wrong with me? (What's wrong with me?)
What's wrong with me? (What's wrong with me?)
What's wrong with me? (What's wrong with me?)
What's wrong with me? (What's wrong with me?)
You might also like
Can you feel the radiation?
Dragging your sister down
You won't feel the alienation
And you'll never leave this town

I know I'm nothing special
And I know I'm nothing great
I know I'm nothing different
But I just don't feel the same

What's wrong with me? (What's wrong with me?)
What's wrong with me? (What's wrong with me?)
What's wrong with me? (What's wrong with me?)
What's wrong with me? (What's wrong with me?)
What's wrong with me?


Well I could be happy with less I guess
If they tell me that less is more
Set a place for me at the table
I won't be hungry anymore
I know I'm nothing special
And I know I'm nothing great
I know I'm nothing different
But I just don't feel the same

What's wrong with me? (What's wrong with me?)
What's wrong with me? (What's wrong with me?)
What's wrong with me? (What's wrong with me?)
What's wrong with me? (What's wrong with me?)

What's wrong with me? (What's wrong with me?)
What's wrong with me? (What's wrong with me?)
What's wrong with me? (What's wrong with me?)
What's wrong? What's wrong?
What's wrong? What's wrong with me?
With me
With me
