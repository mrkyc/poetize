So
Hi, how are you?
I'm sympathizing with you by keeping my coat on okay? So don't feel bad
No, I'm taking this shit off today
Come on hold it against me ten years from now
Uh, I have one more song to do, let's see
Nile, we have some people where they're gonna sing along with us
Thompson Twins and Nile Rodgers, the man who made my record
Give a hand for him
And uhm, this song is called "Love Makes The World Go Round"
And at the end you might have heard it enough
So if you don't feel shy singing along with us, okay?
I know you guys are all major hands, okay? So this is your chance

"Make love, not war," we say
It's easy to recite
But it don't mean a damn
Unless we're gonna fight
But not with guns and knives
We've got to save the lives
Of every boy and girl
That grows up in this world

There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go 'round
That's easy to forget
If you don't hear the sound
Of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go round
You might also like
They think that love's a lie
But we can teach them how to try
Love means to understand
Reach out for someone's hand
Because everything you do
Comes back in time to you
We have to change our fate
Before it gets too late

There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go round
It's easy to forget
If you don't hear the sound
Of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go 'round
Love makes the world go 'round
Love makes the world go 'round
Love makes the world go 'round

Don't judge a man until you've been standing in his shoes
You know that we're all so quick to look away
'Cause it's the easy thing to do
You know that what I say is true
Love makes the world go 'round
Love makes the world go 'round
Love makes the world go 'round
Love makes the world go 'round

"Make love not war," we say
It's easy to recite
But it don't mean a damn
Unless we're gonna fight

There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go 'round
It's easy to forget
If you don't hear the sound
Of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go 'round
Love makes the world go 'round
Love makes the world go 'round
Love makes the world go 'round

Everybody put their hands together!
I wanna hear you!
Now I want you to dance!
Dance!
Love!
Love!
Love!
Love makes the world go 'round!
Love!
Love!
Love makes the world go, I can't hear you!
What? What? Yes!
What?
Love makes the world go 'round
Love makes the world go 'round
Love makes the world go 'round
