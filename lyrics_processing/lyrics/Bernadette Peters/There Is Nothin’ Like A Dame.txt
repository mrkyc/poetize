You got moonlight on the sea
You got mangoes and bananas you can pick right off a tree
You got volleyball and ping-pong and a lot of dandy games
What ain't you got?
You ain't got dames!
You get packages from home
You get movies, you get shows
You get speeches from your skipper
And advice from Tokyo Rose
You get letters doused with perfume
You get dizzy from a smell
What don't you get?
You know damn well
You have nothing to put on a clean white suit for
What you need is what there ain't no substitute for
There is nothin' like a dame
Nothing in the world
There is nothing you can name
That is anything like a dame
You feel restless, you feel blue
You feel lonely and in brief
You feel every kind of feeling
But the feeling of relief
You feel hungry as the wolf felt when he met Red Riding Hood
What don't you feel?
You don't feel good

There is one particular thing that is nothing whatsoever
In any way, shape, or form like any other
There is nothin' like a dame
Nothing in the world
There is nothing you can name
That is anything like a dame
Nothing else is built the same
Nothing in the world
Has a soft and wavy frame
Like the silhouette of a dame
There is absolutely nothing like the frame
Of a dame
There are no books like a dame
And nothing looks like a dame
There are no drinks like a dame
And nothing thinks like a dame
Nothing acts like a dame
Or attracts like a dame
There ain't a thing that's wrong with any man here
That can't be cured by putting him near
