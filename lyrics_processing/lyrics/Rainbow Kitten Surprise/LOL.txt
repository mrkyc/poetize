I want you, but hon
We've been through enough
There's so much of us
Is there no love?

Like my heart hurts
Like my jaw hurts
Like my job hurts
And I'm talking to a wall

Hello operator, can I call you later?
You know shit's been crazy 'round here
Fingertips are shaking, playing Operation
Tag you in the basement, I'm it

I can keep on running
'Til I'm running out of road
Just wait, you keep on asking me
"When are we going home?"
I'm tryna find my soul
I can't tell you if I'm close
Move a little closer
When I needed you the most

'Cause it's bad times, honey
And there's good time money
And it's laugh out loud
When this shit's not funny
I just feel so clueless
Calling you to prove me wrong
Just be honest, oh

Smoke 'em if we got 'em
Let me know if it's a problem
I can tell you what pill
Will be the hardest one to swallow
We can hang around smiles
Off of 7th Avenue
Yeah, we're making bad calls
'Cause we ain't got shit to do

I want you, but damn
I can't hold your hand
I can't be your sandman
I don't need a fan
I am who I am
I'm cool as the goddamn sea
