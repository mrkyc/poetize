We don't give a damn we do as we please
My baby's a sailboat captain at sea
My gal is a good one, tells me she's mine
Wish I's better lookin'
Baby, don't mind
My gal is a good one, tells me she's mine

All I ever wanted was to make you happy
Give you the truth
Anything to make you love me
Any more than you do

My baby's a saint just like an Old George
Good with a dagger and skilled with a sword
All bullshit aside, she's all that and more
