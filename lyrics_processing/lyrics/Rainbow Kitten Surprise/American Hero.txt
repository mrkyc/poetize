My God, do you even know my name?
Are you changing up your mind over changes I never made for you?
We are no more than we'll ever be
With heaven on my mind, and hell, well I believe

I would do anything for you to love me
Like I'm an American hero, baby
Star-spangled in my manner shaking
Every man's hand in the presidential manor, you see
I would do anything to hear you say
There goes an American hero, darling
Call the press and tell 'em all
"He's got a front page picture face with all of the amenities. "

If you really don't mind, take me as I am
Take me as I am, when you get a chance
Take your time, I understand
Believe me when I say I carry all my sins
And I would do anything for you to love me
Call me an American hero, oh
Call me an American hero, oh
Call me an American

Just a dream, pretty thing
Nothing's ever what it seems
Just a dream, I still scream in my sleep
In my sleep I still scream that

I would do anything for you to love me
Like I'm an American hero baby
Star-spangled in my manner
Shaking every man's hand in the presidential manor, you see
I would do anything to hear you say
There goes an American hero darling
Call the press and tell 'em all
"He's got a front page picture face with all of the amenities. "

If you really don't mind, take me as I am
Take me as I am, when you get a chance
Take your time, I understand, believe me
When I say I carry all my sins
And I would do anything for you to love me
Call me an American hero, oh
Call me an American hero, oh
Call me an American hero, oh
