You're a master of passive-aggressive magic tricks
Like, that's not a card that I would've picked but it's your life to live like how you'd like to live
You're type of cool that likes to talk a lot
I'm the type of fool to listen
They say a wise man lends his ears but not his thoughts often
The same is true of undercover cops
And the undercover bubbler got me doubly high as heaven
We're still under the radar, seven billion on the planet
Wading straight to the moon
Salutations to Apollo
While the Mission To Mars is surely soon to follow
And you bit my lip when I kissed you
I bit my tongue not to tell you that I miss you
We shared my blood for an instant and I would trade some more to have it back
Yeah I would trade all of this for that
I'm in the back of a fifteen passenger van doing an expose on feelings I don't fully understand
Started a Matchbox guitar slow jam
With hope just as large as the room in my car

I know I should've been more vocal
Sure, I could've been more social

I've been coasting
I've been coping okay for the most part

Just above the atmosphere flying high
Just above the average fear to try
Keeping me grounded, holding me down for miles
Everybody I know wants the gleam
In designer tops and ten dollar magazines
Infatuated with the beams, you go crazy when I speak
Aggravated when I say what I mean
I mean, I mean
You see, is that
I'm a master of Matchbox guitar sessions
You're a master of passive aggressive magic tricks
Like: that's not the card that I would've picked but it's your life to live like you'd like to live
You're the master of Matlock lock picking lessons
I'm the asshole who keeps laughing at our predicaments
Like this ain't the life that I should've picked
But it's the cards we're dealt we play with
