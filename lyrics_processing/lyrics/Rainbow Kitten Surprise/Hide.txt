You're the only thing that's coming in
I'm getting static from my better sense
Nothing on the FM
See, I've been praying for a signal
A sign that you haven't sent
You might be an angel falling from the Heavens
Or a stranger from a garden party drunk and roaming ever since
I've got a Radio Heart and you're the only thing that's coming in
Static from my better sense
Stagnant on my betterment
I'm praying for signal or a sign that you haven't sent
Running from a place where they don't make people like me
I keep the car running
I keep my bags packed
I don't wanna leave, just don't wanna leave last
I've been praying for your touch, your glance, your hand
And he's a better kisser than you'd think, Mom
He's a better listener than most
We took pretty pictures by the sea,  Mom
Fell in love and sailed off
And when the Son of Man had me in his clutches
The Son of Man had me in his clutches
The Son of Man had me in his clutches
The sons of men pulled me to the touch and I loved it

That's not true, I'd hate to miss you
Anywhere I go anywhere you've been before
I get the chance to say goodbye
Or hello I mean
You don't call
You don't write
You know I've been up for forty days and forty nights and all my fears have multiplied
By the silence in your eyes
Does he stay for the way for the air you're movin
You're movin
Does he stay for the way for the air you're movin
You're losing it
Better Hide your love, Hide your love
Don't let it slip away, don't let it slip away
You better Hide your love
Hide your love
Don't let it slip away
Don't let it slip away
You better Hide your love
Say Hide your love
Now now Hide your love
