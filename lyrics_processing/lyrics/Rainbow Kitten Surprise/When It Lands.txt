Wizard on a weekend
Willing on a weekday
Are you kidding come on
Fed up with the prepay
Looking for a keepsake
I'm no emerald liar
Dying for a card up my sleeve
I'm the gambling kind
For higher stakes and brighter takes I'll play
I'll make a deal with you, if all you want
Is not to leave love, to run 'em up
Call me When It Lands
Hit me up when you're close
Call me when you can
Call me when you're close
Sugar city
Pretty magic
Got me good vibes
Thank God I ain't driving
Traffic vision
Blurred blue bleedin'
That's a black out ladder
It don't matter anyhow
I'm climbing
Keep my good vibes
And check coats for cool climates
In common we got
Good friends rolled light on split ends
Pretty magic
Traffic addicts

Never mind my phone dead forget it
I don't really know where to bake that, less you tryna get in
In which case... my phone dead, forget it
And I never answer calls when I'm in the kitchen
Cooking
It's just a thing
It's out
And I never call back when my friends all looking at me in the car
Cause it'd be all they wanna talk about
Oh you tryna to get a deal? A deal? A deal
Sorry on the real
But my eyes and my ears don't work well
And the floor keeps sliding out my heels
I can't feel 'em am I still dreaming?
Skull on the table a still life
Is this still life?
What's the meaning are we still dealing?
Feel like I can't act right
Oh right

Call me When It Lands
Hit me up when you're close
Call me when you can
Call me when you're close
When were you planning on coming my way?
I've been here waiting all damn day to turn the the lights down low
And turn the table on you
Will you keep all that you came with and more?
I'd play your game but I don't know what for
Cut the cable on
Every table I lose
Call me When It Lands
Hit me up when you're close
