And it ain't going well
You've been running up bills
You had to cancel your cards for shooting out street lamps while shooting at stars
Now your credit is falling
					
Heard it booming at parties, whispered in homes
The pundits on the radio won't leave it alone
I heard it once, heard it twice
Heard it well enough to tell
They say the Mission To Mars, is destined to fail now
	
Climb down to the edge of  your rope
Got a letter 'bout a month ago from control
They say we're coming down hard
We locked our keys in our cars
Or got booted at bars and now the movement is lost
So we blowing up God's phone
Pray he get us off hold soon
Bought our own space but our asses are frozen
Blow enough smoke to punch a hole in the ozone
And all you say is 'we should've stayed home'
Fading, faded, we never made it, faded
Traded for your replacement
Faded we never made it
Watchu tryna be lately?

They say that viewership for launch is up by 50 this week
We changed the format completely, cut the filler for meat
It's just blood on your TV making killings for free
The ticket lines are past the sign down at the end of the street
Meet and greet, VIPs go a million a piece
We delayed the show for entry and so expired on the lease
Now we're gonna re-release it, t.b.d
Change the title to: Fuck You
It's what you want it to be
When you know it only pay to make nice
Pack your shit and standby, please
Your friends are trying to leave and get high
Countdown 'til you come off your rails
They said the Mission To Mars is doing pretty well
I heard it once, heard it twice, I heard everybody tell
