Got on the U down to King's Cross Station
Where the cross kids were smoking in the street
Mr. Redundant's got a boy in London
Asking questions no one had a right to be

Say hey mister are they hey hey!
Are dey are dey hey hey!
Ah dey are dey are!
Say hey mister are they hey hey!
Are dey are dey hey hey!
Ah dey are dey are!

I saw the crosses of empty cathedrals
Whose prospects were hanging out in bars
Mrs. Facetious' got a man who preaches
What the Beatles believed
"Love is all you need!"

Say hey mister are they hey hey!
Are dey are dey hey hey!
Ah dey are dey are!
Say hey mister are they hey hey!
Are dey are dey hey hey!
Ah dey are dey are!

Life called to say
Hello to curlin' up with a bottle
Feelin' better than you do, better than you do
What you say? Here it comes
Well right now I'm a little drunk
But I'll let you know, said I'll let you know

Say Mister are they hey hey!
Are dey are dey hey hey!
Ah dey are dey are!

Well the pregame was bad
But the post-man was worse
And the president kept saying shit that we'd already heard
So we kept the TV off
And I kept on writing songs
That I knew you'd come to hate
If you ever knew what they were about
Don't shout at me like I'm across the room
When I'm right here, when you're right this time
We'll do better in another life, in another time, with another
Say Hey Mister are they hey hey!
Are dey are dey hey hey!
Ah dey are dey are!

Say
Hello to curlin up with a bottle
Feelin better than you do, better than you do
What you say? here it comes
Well right now I'm a little drunk
But I'll let you know, said I'll let you know
Will you say in time
Right now we're doing fine
But we'll let you know, said we'll let you know
