Twenty years to see New York reflected on subway trains
'Bout twenty more I'll be forty-four, head back to Tampa Bay
I killed a man there, in spite, and when he died, I took his place
Eighteen made you callous to the kisses that you gave
A coarse exchange, a cause for blame, and I stood out in the rain
You killed a man there, and I cried, but the rain masked the hurt behind your face
By the way dear we're alive, and it hurts 'cause we survived it

Goodbye love, and good luck in life
And goodnight Chicago, die with a smile
You'd have loved her, loved her
But you won't, you don't know, no no no no no no

Don't shut down on me now, don't shut down on me
Don't shut down on me now, don't shut down on me
Don't wait until I drown to save me from it
Goodnight Chicago, I killed a man to make you love me

If the water's warm, filling up my head, I take
Another one, Lord knows it's hard to stay
Sober! When heaven's in your past and you have hell to pay
Slower, I'm hung over, but I'm sorry that I'm late
Eighteen made you callous to the kisses that you gave
In one more I stood out in the rain

Don't shut down on me now, don't shut down on me
Don't shut down on me now, don't shut down on me
