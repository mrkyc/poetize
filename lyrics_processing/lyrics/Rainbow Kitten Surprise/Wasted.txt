I know your type, black lights and leather tights
You're black ice on the road on a drunken summer night, but
I got your number, your name, and your will to fight
Will you be coming over? Will you be coming? Reckon you might

How can I care, how can I care for you?
How can I bear to love you any less than you need
How can I hold you?
How can I bear to lose the bruises that you leave?

If you let go of me I'd be a fool to let you, fool to let you leave
Drunk on love or anything so strong as to drive the blood to make way for
For more when you've forty-four left, forty-four left
Children beg for the bread that you won't give
Your boyfriend stands to wait all for you
Drink up you're wasted on me
Drink up you're wasted

Running that money ma, living loose, playing hard
Damned if I'm gonna lose it, damned if I'm gonna lose it
And you're runnin low, chink in your glass, a knock at the door
What you looking at me for?
What you looking at me
