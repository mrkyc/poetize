I'm not satisfied
With that look up in your eyes
With that face you make when I come down around here lately
Baby I just wanna ride
With the cool kids kickin' it, watching all the other six
Fools on the interstate
Sugar-shakin', making it, lit like Christmas trees

Light it up, let it glow, let it pull, let it blow
Up and dry
You're up and dry
A hundred suns, hundred notes, easy come, easy go
Up and dry
You're up and dry

Don't you ever feel like you ever wanted anything more
Than everybody, anybody else
Seventeen and bad, was the best you never had
And you won't
Sins you never said for yourself

Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Everybody got a name
Everybody got a number
Seven sins, six frames
Five for the two of us
Three is too much if there's only one love, and

I don't believe that anybody's god ever felt this way
'Cause if they had, they never would've made me
They'd say "Hell no!" Wake me up at ten
Tomorrow, for my sake, keep the volume down please"
Doesn't everybody try to do their best at what they do best
And do less of the bad to begin with?
Doesn't leaving me mean a little less if you left my life
But never loved to begin with?
You never loved to begin with
You never loved me
You never loved to begin with
You never loved me

Don't you ever feel like you ever wanted anything more

And you won't, sins you never said to yourself

For the six months you gave
The seventh month you keep
You stay for six days
And the seventh day you'll leave
And every day you're here
I count until you're gone
