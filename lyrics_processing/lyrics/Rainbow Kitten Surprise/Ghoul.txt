I know the feeling cold
I felt it creeping
Beneath my bedpost
I let it closer
If it possess me, will I levitate gently?
Will you find me in violence eyes with ultraviolet?
Who am I?

Am I my brother's keeper
If I could save another
Who then be your redeemer?
Why should I save my soul if I never get to keep it?
Not getting any warmer
But I'm reaching
Back to that feeling
Cold, I felt it creeping
It's something wicked
I brought it with me
If it possess me, will I levitate gently?
Will you find me repulsive?
Uncertain of my motives
Who am I?

Am I my brother's keeper?
How could I stand corrected
If I'm my only teacher?
Why should I save my soul if I never get to keep it?
Not getting any warmer
But I'm reaching
Will I ever even know it
If I become my demons?
Ever even know it
When I become my demons?
Ever even know if I burn good
I burn slow, I burn bright
Who and when and why
You can't be the reason anymore

I know that feeling
Souls I felt it stealing
Right through my curtain
I let it come in
I let it come and possess me in the twilight
Undressed with all my best intentions from my essence
Who am I?

Am I my brother's keeper?
If I should save another
Who then be your redeemer?
How could I save my soul if I never get to keep her
Maybe not getting warmer
But I'm reaching

I was a shadow
And one to follow straight to the meadows
Of Sleepy Hollow
I can't even tell you, tell me does it sound familiar
Tell me, tell me, I'm the realest
Tell me I'm the one for you

Okay, so show me the ropes
Show me the hope, show me the cost
Show me the coast, show me the most
Show me the most, babe
Love you the most
Do what I'm told, do what you want
Do what you need
Tell me I'm free (Yeah) to be

Will I ever even know it
If I become my demons
Ever even know it
If I become my demons
Ever even know if I burn good
I burn slow, I burn bright
Who and when and why
