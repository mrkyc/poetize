It's pay to play rules and
Today's a day for suit and tie celebration
Nailed it hammered loose and I'm
Falling down with shit caked in my shoes
I ain't feeling this pair of 2s
Ante up or  just fold boy
Take a whirl or take to
Fakin' it baby
I've been patient watching you the way move
Detecting all of your clues
Feeding off of your cues like 1 2 3 4 5
I'll get it right and play nice soon as you do
Running off again running off of gin and cigarettes
Front talking it's a cakewalk till I miss a step
Make it there take a breath and start popping a sweat
This molly got me in all my days
I've never seen a show stopper like you
Calling out the moves soon as you MAKE EM UP, JUST A TOUCH
Could make a boy act stupid
Take my delusions grind up into your bowl
Puff on that till I'm blue green serpentine
Visions snaking out of our tea
Not sure what it all means
But I could get used to seeing your cool demeanor lighting my scene up
Tripping all day til we keeping our knees up
Dripping always til our sins look cleaner
Walking down mazes in our minds to find our ways permeate
The walls in your room

Face in
Placate
Flake out
For miles, for mine, for I know
You could sell me on anything
Reach for the telephone or let it ring
Teach me to let it go
I think no luck nothing but us in violence
I hate fighting when I'm driving
Leave me now or leave cagey for 25 exits
Davis Coltrane white lines exchanged in silence
Service fell off in the underground
Caught the line back to your basement
Came with
Fear in my heart
Cold to the touch
Love ain't enough a drug to make us
Make us make amends
You and I, we've been friends through screens
The screens, the screen-door's coming off the rails
Come in, come in
Come off the rails
Failed to reveal appeals apparent to my soul
Call me back if you wanna talk
Long distance collecting love
Strong feelings ain't enough to break the silence holding us
Hold my phone
If you needed me then, then, then, why wouldn't you bring it up?
Then why wouldn't we be together if "all that we need is us" ain't too much as ask for?
Nah it ain't too much
Ain't too much
I hate to say that I miss you first but
Send my love send my love right away baby
All day all night I wish you would leave me
Hurting
I know us is more than we deserve but
If I may and you're awake I'll be coming home late
It'd be cool if I could stay for a minute
Baby lately I've been waiting
To feel your mood move me
I love the way you know how
I love the way you walk out
I love the way you shut it
Down
Now
