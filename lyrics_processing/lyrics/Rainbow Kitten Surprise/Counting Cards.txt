Picture me counting cards, dear
Pick any kind you like
Picture them colored red, dear
Black will hold back the light
From the stars in our eyes are just diamonds, broke
Jokes we tell to laugh, dear
Laugh to hold back the pain
Pain is in the mind, dear
Stars are much the same
Gone in the time it takes the light to reach
In time you'll find
We're blind to the things we don't believe

Picture us out in Vegas counting bills before the show
Spendin' em from New Orleans where we spent the week before
And the stars in our eyes are the lights from the flash
Pictures of us in black, dear
Rolling on the red carpets laid on concrete
Counting billboards where we read
That the stars of our minds shine bright in the dark
Like diamonds, diamonds

And hearts in our cards and our silver strung guitars
Say hear me when I call
Hear me when I come in late
You're wide awake
"I'm sorry" is not enough
I'm sorry I'm not enough to stay

In time with the back of your bed
Am I that levy you take, that levy you hold
Faded by in time
With the back of your bed
Am I that levy you break, that levy you hold

Paint me red, paint me red
Picture that, picture that
Picture us and God shaking hands just because we can
Like DMC we run this shit, Run DMC
What's tricky to get we got
Watch me murder this
Watch me murder this

Planes fly due west, and
Plain in my view is the blame for the fault in our stars
Counting cards in the dark
We sit and talk, bleeding it out
Believing that all our cries are just diamonds

Hearts in our cards and our silver strung guitars
Say hear me when I call
Hear me when I come in late
You're wide awake
"I'm sorry" is not enough
I'm sorry I'm not enough to stay
Faded by in time
With the back of your bed
Am I that levy you take, that levy you hold
Faded by in time
With the back of your bed
Am I that levy you break, that levy you hold
Faded by in time
With the back of your bed
Am I that levy you take, that levy you hold
Faded by in time
With the back of your bed
Am I that levy you break, that levy you hold
