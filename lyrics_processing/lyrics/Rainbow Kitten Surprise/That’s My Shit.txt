Pray for me if you still believe
Sometimes I just feel like nobody's listening
Or moves in a way that I cannot see
Save the music now ringing in my ears

My dreams go bad, baby
My trials, they die lately
My truths they hide, waiting
Patiently, circling my mind
I'm all faded, I'm gazing, dilated
To the back with the bad, baby, fighting for

Now they're standing in the door
Saying "That's my shit, that's my shit"
That's what everybody wants some more of
Singing, "You may be the death of me"
No disrespect, baby, but that's my shit, that's my shit
That's what everybody's on the floor for
Singing, "You may be the death of me"

You ohh, you ohh
You ohh, you may be the death of me
You ohh, you ohh
You ohh, you may be the death of me

Didn't even say goodbye, not even half the time
And now I'm here and it's been thirteen years
And I ain't gonna cry 'bout it
I don't know where home is but I suppose it's anywhere I go
That's any good at all
Is that my fault, is that all my fault?

My dreams go bad, baby
My trials, they die lately
My truths they hide, waiting
Patiently, circling my mind
I'm all faded, I'm gazing, dilated
To the back with the bad, baby, fighting for

Now they're standing in the door
Saying "That's my shit, that's my shit"
That's what everybody wants some more of
Singing, "You may be the death of me"
No disrespect, baby, but that's my shit, that's my shit
That's what everybody's on the floor for
Singing, "You may be the death of me"

You ohh, you ohh
You ohh, you may be the death of me
You ohh, you ohh
You ohh, you may be the death of me
Everybody got a mind of their own
And nobody mind following everybody else
I felt it, what's your problem
That's my shit, that's my shit, that's my-
Everybody gotta a day where they gotta pay with responsibility
Disappear like honey bees, you
Now what's your problem, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my-
I just can't go along if everybody else is doing it
'Cause everybody else is wrong if everybody else is doing it, listen
Everybody got a mind of their own
And nobody mind following somebody else
Sometimes open up your mind to my shit, to my shit, to mine

Pray for me if you still believe
Sometimes I just feel like nobody's listening
Or moves in a way that I cannot see
