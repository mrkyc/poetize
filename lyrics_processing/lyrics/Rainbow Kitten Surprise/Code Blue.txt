When it's something strange
And it don't look good
Who you gonna call, babe?
Who you gonna turn to?
When you lost the pain
That became your truth
Who is it you are, babe?
Who will you turn into?
When the rules have changed
So you play to lose
Did you make it far, babe?
Did you start at all?

Burning blue smoke
Stay where I can hear ya
Danger at the door
Stranger in the mirror
Something coming close
If I become your ghost
Don't even grab your coat
Stay with me we're leaving
If I become your ghoul

With your feelings played
And your tears as proof
Will you play again, girl?
Will you ever learn?

Code blue
On fire and you're aching all the time
Steady shake me off your mind
Said you never meant to hurt me
But you're tired and we're hanging on the wire
Couple days and we'll be fine
Just a dip it's not the tires you were crying, I'm
