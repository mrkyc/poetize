Not whole, not wholly separate, but syncopated
Single in our nature, and because of the times
Not a word was said when the lights came on
Or a glance given pause at the cost of our desired wrongs
It's second nature to love you, it's first to die
And we were killed upon waking, killed upon waking to the life
We weren't prepared to live but rebelled to realize
We were killed upon the pavement, Bonnie we're immortalized in

Blood, cold, cold love, we were still young
When the radio lights came on
Elton's on the air, no fair dear that we were still here
In the absence of everything, abstain from fear
And if I cry in your arms
Just some other shit, just some other shit
Just some other things that I've been dealing with
I'd die in your arms, bury me while playing this
Bury me saying "You were all I ever needed"
And hold me like we're dying from the liquor that we drank
Down in hotel rooms, to feel warm in cold love

What's harder, harder to say?
That you want me to stay
That you want me to stay unchanged for you?
Chained to a lie, we're the same, you and I, we're the same
Not the same, we hurt differently, but consistent in our pain
Equal and equidistant in the way we laugh
To lay bare the weight of our cold love affair
Recalling the days where we were, we weren't, we were
Wrong for the papers, wrong for the dinner tables
Of the inner rings of the rich and famous anythings
It's gone, not bad, just gone, my bad, just wrong, we had
And we had, and we were then in

Chained to a lie, who's to blame? Let it die, we're the same
