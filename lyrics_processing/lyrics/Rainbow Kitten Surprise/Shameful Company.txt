Was I born a stone? Heavy to hold
And cold in the hands that you left me to warm in the sun
Was I born alone? Have I recently
Developed a propensity to push people away?
Am I okay with that?

Take it any way you want to
She lit a fire in your head, standing with a flower in her hair
And alcohol plus information often makes it, complicated
So you'll hate me, make love
Lately I've spent my days in daydreams waking you, me
Saving every heartbeat, word, line that you ever gave to me
'Cause fair is a weather condition

If you're cold, go inside
If you're tired, go to sleep
If you're weak, come to me, find shameful company
If you're cold, go inside
If you're tired, go to sleep
If you're weak, come to me, find shameful company

We were young, dumb, taking our chance
And making romance and breaking our promises
Trying to be and failing miserably
But am I too late, or hearts to your spades?
If I don't suit you then what do you want from me?
So we're not written in the stars but I'm okay with that
I'm okay with anything
