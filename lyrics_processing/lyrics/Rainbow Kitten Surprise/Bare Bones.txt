Outta town girls
They all just want a chance to see the cityscape
And lead a looser game with
All the town boys, they all just want a chance with 'em
I understand you can bet your bare bones
She'll be coming back for more
And what for?
Should've called, should've wrote, leave a note
For her before you close that door
For some closure
You know she told ya she loves the way you speak
To her in the margins of a postcard she keeps from you

Where are the marks of your failed hearts?
Have your daydreams been keeping you clean? (No)
You never say what you need
To make me believe you're the one that means it
And I hope it ain't you, I hope it ain't you to let me down
Don't fail me now I'm running thin
And I've just begun to wonder when you'll let me in, in, in, in, in

I've got Jesus in my eye, and the Devil in the corner making rye whiskey and gin
Don't you say that ain't him
You should've seen him when he came in
He said "The Yankees played today, they played
But in the eighth the Sox, they clutched the game"
At least the Mets are getting laid
Ah yea, that's what they say

Everybody everywhere is coming to your party
I heard this was the place to be, yea
Not a lot that you can't get for free here

Where are the scars of your failed hearts?
Have your daydreams been keeping you clean? (No)
You never say what you need to make me believe you're the one that means it
I hope it ain't you, I hope it ain't you to let me down
Don't fail me now I'm running thin
