You said I'll come back, I'll come back for you my love
Wait for me
You said you're the only, you've been the only one I love
And love believes
But love is a bird that you kept in your coat, warm until it died in the dark
And death is the love of what hurts you the most
So you drink your day away till you're warm as paradise

I'm not hurt I'm broken, but I called to say I'm fine
And I heard you had another love, but I'd love you to think I don't mind
The baby in your arms ain't mine, but I made believe as though it was
And I didn't mean to call this late but I think I'm in love
With the thought of us

So you drink your day away till the liquor in your mouth laughs
And mirrors paint you beautiful like older photographs
But we grow, we grow old, even this won't last
And no one understands and no one cares at all
And they're tearing down our sacred places in the hall
You know I hate to dance, still you ask, still you ask for my hand

But I love you like the kids love throwing bottles of the bridge
And breaking in to trade your fix for American shoes
For American shoes
I've been dying to lie awake in a room for two
I'll come back, I'll come back for you my love
