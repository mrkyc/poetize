What you want me to say?
I ain't got nothing left for you
Nothing left to lose, save let loose
Ends lie still, cause you still look good
When you lie to me, and anything in-between

How you gon' do me like that when you walk so bad?
Walk so bad, lady
Love it when you lean like that and you look so bad
Walk so bad (no)
Lay it down hard, and you ante up babe
She's addicted to the prettier things
All but over you, over you, over
Baby, what you got to lose?

Come stay with me
Leave it on the low
But lady don't lie to me
No you really don't, really don't
Hurt so bad, hurt so bad
When you move your lips, move your body like
I'm all over you, over you, over
Baby what you got to lose?
Come stay, fly
Lady lie with me (Oooh)
You're bourbon in my eyes
A bird in my hands
A bird in my hands, bourbon to my head
A bird in my eyes, a flight risk

Lying on my come-up, we're hung up on these nights
You're hung over knees like you needed the relapse
Need this, need that, need it when you can't have
Whatchu wanna do about it? Whatchu wanna take back?
