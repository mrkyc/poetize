How do you take so much and leave nothing for the morning?
And think nothing of it? Think of nothing but this
This is that, this is that slip on glass till you bleed
Wade up to your knees in ash, lookin for the very last

Ain't no-one gonna come and save you, and pull you out now
Ain't no-one gonna come and save you, and pull you out

Beneath your lips lies the trick of it, babe
For a couple licks you can get your fix and more
Pick any dream you want
Stay in denial for the shit that gets you shaking in your car
To come and see me like, lately I've been fucking up hard
And I hate it when you lie in the thick of it all

Your heart, there it goes
Step up, and track down somebody who knows
How to give a fuck about your black, black bag
I know all the combinations of your cool imagined compromise
Your time expired
You're driving me to drink, and I'm running a little low
No matter where you go, no matter where you're going
I can't take you there, I can't guess to get you home
Playing catch-up to the moon
I'd say we're getting pretty close, so
Will somewhere darker be a little more like you?
I can't take you there, I can't guess to get you home
Playing catch-up to the moon
I'd say we're getting pretty close, so
Will somewhere darker, with a little more bite do?

Ain't nobody gonna come and save you, and pull you out now
Ain't nobody gonna come and save you, and pull you out

Beneath your lips lie the trick of it, babe
For a couple licks you can get your fix and more
Pick any dream you want
Stay in denial for the shit that gets you shaking in your car
To come and see me like, lately I've been fucking up hard
