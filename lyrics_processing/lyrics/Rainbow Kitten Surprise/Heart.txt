Hey pretty Momma don't you leave me like that
Bring it on back, bring it on back
Love me don't leave me, don't you leave me like that
Bring it on back, bring it on back

'Cause you're high, you're low
You're fine but you don't say anything
Well you've got my heart in your hands
And your love in my heart
You've got my heart in your hands
And your love in my heart

Well the kids are getting married
Say bless a' my soul
Say that heaven ain't high
But the devil ain't low
Preacher said easy there
You really don't know
Bless a' my soul
You really don't know

When a man loves a woman
He'll say anything
He's got a dove in his hands
And a lover in his heart
He's got a bird in the hands
With a lover in his heart

If you're high, you're low
You're fine but you don't say anything
I don't mind if you won't love when you're gone
But don't say anything
You've got my heart in your hands
And another in your heart
You've got my heart in your hands
And another in your heart

Well for thirty five years, no one ever shed a tear
When the kids died, nobody cried for me
Don't you ever say anything you don't mean
Like you love me
Like you love that you're all that I have
And you're all that I want
Yeah, you're all that I have
And you're all that I want
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Bring it on back, bring it on back now
Aye, aye, aye
Bring it on back, bring it on back now
Aye, aye, aye
Bring it on back, bring it on back now

If you're high, you're low
You're fine but you don't say anything
Nevermind what you won't, sometimes
You just don't say anything
But she's got a gun in her hands
And a burden in her heart
But you've got love in the head
