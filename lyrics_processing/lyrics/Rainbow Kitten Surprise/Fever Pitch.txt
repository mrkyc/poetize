Hallelujah!
The young king sings a song for the lover, the leaver, the lonely alike
Young love waits; if I can't, then I'll meet you at the gate of Saint Peter when the fever takes my mind
My God she came singing my name, sounded like rain on the mountain where I burn alive
Young flame burn soft as a candle lit between our two hearts just beats apart in the dark

Spent my summer riding high (high) on the whiplash
Head back
Blowing through the leaves
Growing up a preacher was all you ever dreamed

I got the holy roll
I got the holy roll
I felt the fever grip when I needed it close (and)
I'm at the Fever Pitch
Not quite but nearing it
Can't feed the fever yet I'm saving up my daily measurement

I'm at the grocery store
I'm buying eggs and toast
I'm looking at you and not where I walk, 'bout broke my nose facing doors
Don't let the fever get you
Got got already
Lost my soul in the seventh heaven making out on aisle eleven

Spent my summer riding high (high) on the whiplash
Head back
Blowing through the leaves
Growing up a preacher was always just a dream
All you ever needed were lines you could believe
Sing them to me sweetly
Only just a dream

Well I know you can't walk
With them heels in the dark
Kick 'em off
Let's talk
Let me get to know you
Well I don't know nothin'
But I'm quick pickin' up and
I think I could get you in a minute or two
Yeah if I could get a minute
Four, five at the limit
I think I might make you
Smile after dinner
Kick me under the table
I think that's my in
And I think I came for that
What comes with it?
Let it simmer
Let it simmer
Simmer down please

I got the holy roll
I got the holy roll
I felt the fever grip me when I needed it most (thank the lord)
I'm at the Fever Pitch now
I'm at the Fever Pitch
Not quite but nearly there
