And this crowd right before me doesn't care that I'm dying
And the audience stands with their eyes fixed on the preconceived version of me
I'm so betrayed by your hopes, but I will not hide myself for your peace of mind
Oh, but Child. I've got Vices like any other man
Raise a boy to a cynic. Take his love, and then let it turn into something passionate
Something sick, something rabid
And I vent to keep myself from caving. I don't hate you, I just hate where I'm heading
I'm left here asking, when did I trade in my bleeding heart for a selfish win?
Oh, but Mother. I've got Vices like any other man
Vices that you're not used to. Vices that'll make you think less of me
Leave me numb. Leave me jaded. She's a dream, I just play dead
I've been blessed, I've been hated. She's the constant, and I'm her addict
She's the only peace in this world, uneasy
While I bite my tongue to keep from breaking the heart that I've spent my whole life seeking
The only heart I've ever needed
Oh, but Lover. I've got Vices like any other man
Vices that you're not used to. Vices that'll make you think...
Oh, but Lover. I've got Vices like any other man
Vices that you're not used to. Vices that'll make you think less of me. Less of me
You might also likeFeeling cold, feeling empty. I am low, unworthy
Bleed the God. Bleed the blessing. Like a vulture feasting
I'll exist as if I don't feel conviction of my ignorance to my perfect prison
But I feel the stabs on my wrists and ankles every time I try...
To forget you. To forget you
Oh, but Jesus. I've got Vices like any other man
