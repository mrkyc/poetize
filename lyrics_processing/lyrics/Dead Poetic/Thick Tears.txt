Sometimes I think that the rain won't stop, and we're caught up in foolish games
A tear falls down amongst the clouds, as you weep in fear and pain
A bridge to cross, an obstacle found. My face bleeding from this rain
And all the time you see my eyes with a spark of new beginning
So sorrowful as the temper flies, a maze, your world of sinning
And all the haters fail to see The path where true love dwells
And all the things you hoped you'd be may burn with the flames of hell
(CRY FOR LIFE)
(YOU, ME BEYOND THE SEAS OF LIES)
(CRY FOR LIFE)
(YOU, ME BEYOND THE SEAS OF LIES)
Dirty, filthy from the thoughts inside, the shame painted in red on your face
Bitter with the ties to the lies, eyes wide since I had that taste
If you were me and I were you, never having this confrontation
I'd strive to realize and find out why you don't carry out the proclamation
In my shoes I've seen the best. But the filth along the way
The drugs, the sex, and all the rest, still remains loud present day
But my eyes grow weary quick, searching for light inside
Crying, your tears so thick. buckle up, come along for the ride
CHORUS
(CLOSE, CLOSE YOUR EYES)
(CLOSE, CLOSE YOUR EYES)
(lightening strikes) Lightening strikes and I close my eyes tight
For the vision of you in this deep, dark night
Battered hard with the worlds filthy offerings
Blood -bathed with his wrists as the angels sing
Sick, fed up with this day to day life
Trying to proclaim, let them see Your light
Disappoint in my quarters, all alone
A bright light, stop the press, hold the phone
Your wide palm of love, descend from above
Your love, truth, Lord, what dreams is made of
Lead the path, pull the wool from my eyes
Such a black, such a pity, my disguise
My eyes tempted, but permanently lifted
Check out the Son because his light I see so vivid
