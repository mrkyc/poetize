I cannot bear to do it alone
Pray this prayer for me because
I have no strength to go on
You won't understand me
And I won't I understand completely
You don't know what its like
To die inside so completely
Take this breath for me (Take this breath for me)
Take this breath for me (and hold me close and hold me close)
Take this breath for me (Take this breath for me)
Take this breath for me (and hold me close and hold me close)
Battered bruised and unclothed in self pity
But I cannot change this city
Downtrodden upon like an insect infect
I know so much I haven't realized yet (x2)
I can't go on no I've tried and tried take this breath God dry my eyes (x4)
Take this breath for me (Take this breath for me)
Take this breath for me (and hold me close and hold me close)
Take this breath for me (Take this breath for me)
Take this breath for me (and hold me close and hold me close)
You might also likeI can't go on no I've tried and tried take this breath God dry my eyes (x4)
So I can't go on lord I told you I couldn't
But you love me, you bless me
Standing here I've died inside
Take this breath for me (Take this breath for me)
Take this breath for me (and hold me close and hold me close)
Take this breath for me (Take this breath for me)
Take this breath for me (and hold me close and hold me close)
Call it what you will but you lie and I've died
Call it what you need because you want my life
Call it what you will but you lie and I've died
Call it what you need what you want is in front of you
Call it what you will call it what you need
