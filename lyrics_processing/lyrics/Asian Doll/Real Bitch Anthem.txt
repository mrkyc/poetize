Aye, the fuck this nigga calling my phone, what?
Nigga you can't check me, you gotta check for me?
Do you got some bands for me?
Yeah, did you ever give me something?
Hell nah, get your goofy ass outta her boy

I can't stand no broke ass nigga sit down
Always calling me for money trying to smoke my loud
They be some fans
Tweaking, acting like your regular bitch
I know these niggas piss, boy you can't sex shit
I need some neck bitch
I shot your new bitch
That hoe ain't real as me, that bitch can't even get rich
Jumped out the porch, I was so young, my mind been set
All them hundreds, and them fifties can't be a dollar less
I know a nigga groupie, he call me pretty pussy
He give me money cause I'm boujie and my hoodie coogie
I got on makeup still look better then your fucking momma
Why you faking like you got it boy your pockets dying
Last week you hit me up, I gave you no reply
Don't give a fuck about a thot niggas bound to die
Quit that fucking lying, I keep an attitude
You ain't a real nigga stunting in your homies shoes
You got a pent house, with bout six dudes
All your crack cards scamming to you out the loot
I am from outta space, finesse a niggas face
They just wanna fuck a famous bitch off instagram
I be turning niggas down like a bowling alley
I got thirties and my bitches throw they titties out
Dumb ass nigga, who's a slut you got the wrong bitch
Stay in my DM's on that goofy ass thirsty shit
See you in person, I'm to clean, I can't even speak
Your brain so small from that lean and all that shitty weed
Hyping pussy ass rappers head cause they got clout
Go get your own, see Lil' Asian I'ma get it now
Gotta different nigga, different day, No talk it out
Be in the studio with Barbie bitch we be cute off drugs
Her pussy loose as fuck, you fucked her anyways
Basic ass nigga, sent her on a get away
Go fuck around and catch eights or a raping case
Can't praise no nigga with no cheap ass mixtape
No dinner dates, lunch dates, just give me sloppy face
And when you done nigga don't act like we go together
Was broke alone ain't no nigga give me no cheddar
My brother taught me bout you faggot ass buzz killers
Drugs dealers, treeba, yeah take a niggas check
This the song where my bitches gon' get they respect
He was lacking off that drank you coulda hit a stain
But you a real young bitch don't want no nigga chain
And don't you wanna boss up and stay out niggas face
It's a difference from a groupie and a gang member
I don't know nobody but my mans can't hang with her
Pillow talking bout your mans for a name nigga
Lame ass nigga, dirty trash nigga
With them small ass dreads I'm on your ass nigga
Tripping bout a hoe you niggas through
We don't care just want some throat
I have niggas they be act pretend like they don't know you though
I'll write on your instagram page and like your pictures and DM you
Nigga who the fuck you think you is?
I don't know you!
This my world, swerve a nigga like a cinnamon roll
All these niggas be hoes
All these niggas be through with them same ass clothes
Nigga who you think you is, I be pimpin' on a bitch
I don't give a fuck about a nigga if he was rich
Niggas they be spazzing they be trying to beat a bitch
But Lil' Asian, I ain't going yeah my thirty got a clip
And my purse cost a grip and my pants cost a G
Lame niggas they be talking yeah these niggas I can't see
Anywhere I go, you know the doll yeah she's VIP
I ain't even gotta speak I bet the bouncers know me
