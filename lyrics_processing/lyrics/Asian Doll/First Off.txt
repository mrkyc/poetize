(Bankroll Got It)

First off, bitch, you know that I'm the hardest doll
First off, I'm the reaper standin' at your door
First off, who told bitches they was so important?
First off, talkin' crazy, now you eatin' the floor
First off, bitch, you know that I'm the hardest doll
First off, I'm the reaper standin' at your door
First off, who told bitches they was so important?
First off, talkin' crazy, now you eatin' the floor

Runnin' red lights in a NASCAR
Never askin' mama for some money, she ain't had none
And my burner raised and break a nigga jelly jam jar
You can take it how you wanna, fear no bitch, ain't ran from
Say I'm problem jetted 'cause I'm really, really wit' it
Ate my pussy like a picnic, ho, you tight just like a fitted
Project bitches, we call 'em birds, while we toot up, it gon' swerve
Broke ass nigga, on my nerves, smokin', I swear, off the earth (Out the earth, bitch)
Sandman, off a Xan, poppin' rubber bands
I'm not fucking with these hoes, I'd rather dead presidents
Give me problems, shoot your body, pay, delete the evidence
I'm a rookie, sweet as cookies, I'm the bitch you can't offend

First off, bitch, I'm the one, not number two
Throw me in smoke residue
My truck white, word, the engine move
Bitter bitches more then you, I'm high up on my pedestal
You not in your bracket 'cause I'm passin'
Bitch, I run shit in my tennis shoes
It's a show off, hardest hitter, role call
Lyin' on my name, Pinocchio you need a nose job
Hoe you ain't no street bitch, you ain't never seen shit
Talkin' 'bout them Dracos, you the type to cop a plea quick
Bitch, ayy, it's a role call (grrrrrah)
Ayy, it's a role call
Hundreds, role call
Asian, role call
Eskimo, bitch (Asian Doll!)
