Hold up (Ayy)
Hold up (Ayy)
Hold up (Ayy)
(Bankroll Got It)

Nut up on his face, tell him, "Mask off"
Any bitch got a problem, we can match off
Shorty said she was real, take that Mac off
Same city, same hood, bitch, you mad fraud
Fuck him in the telly watchin' Belly, ayy
Asian pissed on a bitch like R. Kelly, ayy
It's so hot I took the party, playin' Nelly, ayy
He put ice around my neck to make him jealous, ayy

Runnin' through the game with no cheat codes
Bad bitch in designer, she a freak ho
Money over niggas, bitch, that's been the memo
Left a nigga down bad, how you take those?
You ain't slidin', you ain't ridin', bitch
You ain't poppin', why you speakin' on a fly bitch?
Gettin' money in my sleep, flyin' private
Snipers on the roof, killers move in silence
Ayy, pop out, nigga, we can rock out
You ain't seen no M's, they used to laugh and now I'm up now
Fendi cost some thousands, 40 racks to break a bag down
Bitch ain't seen no money, when she leave she get a pat down (Bitch ho)

First young bitch with a bust down
I'm the first young bitch that was totin' rounds
And the first young bitch with her own sound
So these bitches don't deserve to get a princess crown
Ayy, let 'em tell it, they up next, ayy
Let me show you how you do it, but the best, ayy
Bitch you older, and you losin', she a bird brain
Ain't beefing on the net 'less a check came
Grabbin' on my neck, then stroke
Treat me like a doll, but he fuck me like a hoe
Real street bitch, he a green, he a go
Ain't stressin' over niggas, I'm addicted to the dough (bands)
