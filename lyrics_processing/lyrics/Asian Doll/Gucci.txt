Bitches pushing the peddle

Nigga callin' my line, I do not answer get money on time
Smokin' some dope, head's in the cloud
Word to my latest, I'm making them proud
I am a doll, you know I'm better
When I get cold yeah, that's gucci my sweater
Pushin' the peddle, pussy game wetter
Slippin' n sliddin'  I shoot on the metal

Asian Doll, in my bag, I am that bitch with all of the swag
And I walk, I am a check, these bitches trippin' they thinking they next
Got me a choker, it stay on my neck
Keep  me some diamonds they right on my face
Now I eat sushi, I don't say my grace
With some white bitches, they snortin' the race
Hop out the bed and  I swag, I get that money, I'm flexin', I'm making them mad
I be securing my bag, bitches opinions don't matter it go in the trash
These niggas really be trash, won't let him fuck he still gon get me bag
Poppin' and shoppin' them tags, when I was young used to dream now I'm living the life
You in the dark and I shine like a light
Knife in my heart, I be ready to fight
Industry's nervous they making a pie, I wanna rap like a pie
I got niggas but they lie, bitches fraud in disguise
I can't  help that he want it, own it, push up on me, Cause I'm Asian, I own it

Eeny, miny, moe, sneak diss, get smoked
My niggas reckless, they pull up with poles
Don't get offended, I pull up on hoes
Riding around with my old nigga, 18 with a tesla
We was getting money, we was juggin', still ain't let him fuck
Woulda bought me diamonds, but I had better shit to do
Can't compete with the next bitch, I'm fucking 'bout my loot
Like a hula hoop, money go around, don't be jealous boo
Flyest in my school, outta space is my fucking mood!
