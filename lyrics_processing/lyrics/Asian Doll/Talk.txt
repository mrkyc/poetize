Way I walk, way I talk
Way I walk, way I talk
Way I walk, way I talk
Way I, way I

Way I walk, way I talk, I got bands now
And these bitches wanna know me, be my friend now
Had to get it, I was grindin', got no handouts
Courtside, with lil' Keisha, she the man now
I just ordered all my drip, you can't get those
Any bitches want it, bring it to their air-hole
Fuck with hood niggas who be movin' pesos
Bitch, I got it out the mud, fuck who says so

I've been sick off of mid, I've been through it, yeah
I've been up, I've been down, still got to it, yeah
Two hoes in my ride, so we cruisin' now
Cute face, waist, thick, wow!
Bitch I'm zooted, ain't no higher, I'm a movie
Bitch, she poppin' pussy, I'ma fuck 'em with the Uzi
Countin' up this money, hit that bitch, she wanna sue me
Yeah, know these niggas wanna do me

She a dancer, in my sprinter
In that 'Rari, I be racin', Gucci Benz truck
Put them R's on my car, smokin' cancer
All that beef, Asian Doll, I'm not into
Rockin' different color rainbows on my head
I got all these niggas in my DMs, tryna beg
If he got a M, I let him give me sloppy head
Playin' with my money, I finesse you out your bed

Way I walk, way I talk, I got bands now
