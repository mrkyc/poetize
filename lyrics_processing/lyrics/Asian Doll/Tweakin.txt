Brrr, bitch, you tweakin' (Bitch, you tweakin')

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

If you in that field, know we hikin', hikin', ayy, ayy
Girl, that's just some dick, not exciting, 'citing, ayy, ayy
My outfit cost 6K, run up, I'm still fightin', fightin', ayy
Knock 'em down like we bowlin', bitch, we striking, striking, ayy

Didn't go to school, breakin' the rules
Bitch, I was making the rules, ayy
Call me Ms. Asian, that handle the tool
Young nigga play with them tools
Sit at computers, these bitches, they mighty confused
All of my bands, they blue
I'ma try to catch a nigga, I'ma put him in a pot like stew
Niggas, they soft like food, ayy
Bitch, you tweaking, all my niggas, they reaping
Treat a broke bitch like an eater
Hit my gang on the beeper
These niggas ain't hood, ain't striped like Adidas
Stunting on these hoes, you the dust on the sweeper
Throw a nigga away even though he was a keeper
Bitches be talking, they looking Felicia
Blow a bitch back like some audio speakers
Grab the dope with the gas, big titty bitch, no ass
Put an opp brain on my dash
You ain't got enough money to get up with me
She a groupie, she a bitch, she ain't tough to me
Any nigga that I fuck in love with me
That money keep calling, it be cuffing me
On gang, I was riding in the back seat
Hop out, serve a bitch like a two piece

Got a thirty, that bitch right at your door
All this back and forth, you flip-flop
Ayy, lil' boy, go do your chores
Killed him, put him in a Ziploc
I'm a real ass bitch, so that nigga, he adore
My money so tall, I ball like Shaq
I open my legs, he say it's fat

Pretty ass smile, better hit up my dentist
I'm beating these hoes from start to finish

Young ass bitch and I came from the bli-zock
All of my niggas they know that pi-zop
Better think twice for you dri-zop
You opp bitch, ayy, girl, don't talk that tough shit
