I was caught up in a life of a real bitch
Ain't no faking, I'm the youngest, they gon' feel this
Fifth grade, time was good on the black top
High school, had a nigga with a drop top
Started living, nigga tried to fuck me head up
Fed up, he's just like I wet his bed up
Finesse anybody had to get my bread up
Right or wrong, applying pressure they don't like that

Ain't work a nine to five, check still got that
I'm a leader you a peasant gotta stop that
Bitches wanna be me bad I can picture that
Had to get up off my ass, I'm a running back
Ain't had no role model, I'm these girls role model
Stepping over haters, bitch I'm in Balenciaga's
I'm a robber, any robins for them blue dollars
Hunt yo, ride fours, I'm a crip though
South side, with my brothers like a strip pole
Jack girl, pretty face with a big pole
Elevator smoked out on the top floor
Asian Doll, treat a bitch, I don't like hoes
You can't approach me pat em down treat em like a clown
Bring the movies out, fireworks, rocket sounds
Remember crying to myself, I'ma need it now
I was lost in a world full of bitch niggas
I was stuck in a world full of snitch niggas
Glock, riding by myself, you can't duck fifty
Started cutting bitches off, I can't fuck with em
When you at the top, they act like the fuck with you
Oh, what happened homie?
You was hating, to busy being fake
Blinded by the money and the fame girl you lame
Get some money buy a chain and just maintain
Cause when you blow, you gon' know your life won't be the same

They don't like that, they don't like that
