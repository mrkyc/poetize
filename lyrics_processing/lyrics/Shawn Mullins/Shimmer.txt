His shining eyes are big and blue
And all around him water flows
This world to him is new
This world to him is new
To touch a face
To kiss a smile
And new eyes see no race
The essence of a child
The essence..
He's born to shimmer
He's born to shine
He's born to radiate
He's born to live
He's born to love (but we'll)
Teach him how to hate
And true love it is a rock
Smoothed over by a stream
And no ticking of a clock
Truly measures what that means
Truly measures what that means
And this thing we call our time
I heard a brilliant woman say
She said you know it's crazy
How I want to try and capture mine
I think I love this woman's way
I think I love this woman's..
Way she shimmers
The way she shines
The way she radiates
The way she lives
The way she loves
The way she never hates
You might also likeSometimes I think of all the deaths that can surround me
I know it all as being mine
Then she kisses me and
She wraps herself around me
She gives me love
She gives me time
Yeah yeah
I feel fine
Hey yeah, hey yeah (I feel fine)
But time I cannot change
So here's to looking back
You know, I'd drink a whole bottle of my pride and I'd toast to change
To keep these demons off my back
Just get these demons off my back
Cause I..
I want to shimmer
And want to shine
I want to radiate
I want to live
I want to love
I want to try and learn now not to hate
Try not to hate
We're born to shimmer
We're born to shine
We're born to radiate
We're born to live
We're born to love
