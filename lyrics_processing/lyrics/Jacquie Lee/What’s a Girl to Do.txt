You'd be on my skin like a tattoo
It's not the same to love the game
For the company of somebody
If you love me, like I loved you
You'd take a vow and you'd stay true
You'd be the pain, the Mary Jane
I would shoot you like my favorite drug
I just wish I was the one you wanted
I just wish I was the one to fill your time
I got blue from chasin' you now I'm bonded
Tell me, how am I supposed to say goodbye?
Oh, what's a girl to do?
To get a mutual reaction
You gave me summer blues
And all I give you is affection
Oh, what's a girl to do?
To get a mutual reaction
You gave me summer blues
And all I give you is affection
What's a girl, what's a girl to do-o-o?
What's a girl, what's a girl to do-o-o?
What's a girl, what's a girl to do-o-o?
To do-o-o, oh what to do-o-o?
You might also likeIf I could choose, it'd still be you
No I can't hide, you see through
And if I lose when we fight-
I'll take the abuse every night
So I try to put my mind over matter
Remind myself of what really matters
Like the moon and the night
Honey, you gave me light
My reflection is bright when I got you by my side
Oh, what's a girl to do?
To get a mutual reaction
You gave me summer blues
And all I give you is affection
Oh, what's a girl to do?
To get a mutual reaction
You gave me summer blues
And all I give you is affection
What's a girl, what's a girl to do-o-o?
What's a girl, what's a girl to do-o-o?
What's a girl, what's a girl to do-o-o?
To do-o-o, oh what to do-o-o?
What to do?
Oh, what's a girl to do?
To get a mutual reaction
You gave me summer blues
And all I give you is affection
Oh, what's a girl to do?
To get a mutual reaction
You gave me summer blues
And all I give you is affection
What's a girl, what's a girl to do-o-o?
What's a girl, what's a girl to do-o-o?
What's a girl, what's a girl to do-o-o?
