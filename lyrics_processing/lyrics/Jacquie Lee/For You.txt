Never used to be like this
Oh, the city destroyed ya
Said you'll never be like them
Now you're snorting them white lines
With your fake friends
And I don't know if you know this
But they all got a motive (yeah)
They don't want you for you
They'll disappear when you lose
They're real when your on the rise
Oh, please don't get it confused
Know Hollywood did you good
(If you don't, then you should)
Know that I would never go
(No I won't, though I could)
For you, for you, for you I'd do anything, anything
For you, for you, for you I'd do anything, anything
I'll be there no matter what they say
Even when you're strung out and lonely
For you, for you, for you I'd do anything, anything
You might also like(I'd do any, I'd do anything for)
(I'd do any, I'd do anything for you)
Running from your heavier problems
You depend on the bottle (yeah)
Try to see what is real
You're only numbing your pain
It doesn't get any better
When it's all fake
Make a toast to all your new things
And livin' out your big dreams
Tell me how does it feel
To constantly be concealing
You can't pity yourself
You got lost in the appeal and
Know Hollywood did you good
(If you don't, then you should)
Know that I would never go
(No I won't, though I could)
For you, for you, for you I'd do anything, anything
For you, for you, for you I'd do anything, anything
I'll be there no matter what they say
Even when you're strung out and lonely
For you, for you, for you I'd do anything, anything
(I'd do any, I'd do anything for)
(I'd do any, I'd do anything for you)
Know Hollywood did you good
(If you don't, then you should)
Know that I would never go (Know that I would  never let you go)
(No I won't though I could)
Never let you go, oh
For you, for you, for you I'd do anything, anything
For you, for you, for you, I'd do anything, anything
I'll be there no matter what they say
Even when you're strung out and lonely
For you, for you, for you I'd do anything, anything
(I'd do any, I'd do anything for)
(I'd do any)
