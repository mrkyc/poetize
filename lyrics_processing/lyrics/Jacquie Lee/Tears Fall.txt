Tears fall and I know
That this pain is just a part of life
Tears fall and I know
That this pain is just a part of life

I had enough, 'fore you had enough
How on earth did you don't see?
You too good to show up a little better
Why you keep on playing me?
I put my hands back on the tought of my love
Cause I felt you're driving me
Into a deep darkness, into the darkness

And I don't let you see me cry
Didn't ask why
Just told you that your leaving tonight
This is your heart, goodbye

Tears fall and I know
That this pain is just a part of life
Tears fall and I know
That this pain is just a part of life
You might also like
I can take a deep breath, now that you have left
You didn't get the best of me
The raw pain never goes away, but it gets better everyday
I was so wrapped up, I was blinded by love
Couldn't see you wait to leave
But I'm not coming out of the darkness, out of the darkness

And I don't let you see me cry
I don't ask why
Why you not here with me tonight?
Already said, goodbye

Tears fall and I know
That this pain is just a part of life
Tears fall and I know
That this pain is just a part of life

I watched you leave, gonna brief
Gonna cry for like I was dying
Then I let a tear fall
Let myself feel it all
And now I know, now I know
That I'm gonna survive
If I let a single tear fall
Drive myself in it all
Tears fall and I know
That this pain is just a part of life
Tears fall and I know
That this pain is just a part of life
Tears fall and I know (Tears fall and I know)
That this pain is just a part of life (That this pain is just a part of life)
Tears fall and I know
