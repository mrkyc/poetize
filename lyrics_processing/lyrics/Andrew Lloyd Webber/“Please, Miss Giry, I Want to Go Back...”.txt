Please, Miss Giry
I want to go back!
I want my mother!
MEG:
The world is hard
The world is mean
It's hard to keep
Your conscience clean
GUSTAVE:
(Please, you're hurting me!)
MEG:
The sea is calm
The sea is gray
It washes
Everything away
GUSTAVE:
(I can't swim!)
MEG:
(Don't worry, it's almost over.)
Sink into the deep
Blue and cool and kind
Then drift off to sleep
Let the past unwind
Leave the hurt behind

GUSTAVE:
(Mother!)
MEG:
(No, I'm not done yet!)
PHANTOM:
(Let go of the boy, now!)
MEG:
Not another step
PHANTOM:
(Let go of him, girl, or I promise you - !)
MEG:
(Not another word!)
Always wondered
How to make you watch!
Well, watch me now!
I took a little trip to Coney Island
I took a little trip because of you
I did as Mother said and followed where you led
And tried to do what little I could do
Well, here's the way it works on Coney Island
They make you pay for every little crumb
I gave what they would take, I gave it for your sake
Now look at me and see what I've become
Bathing beauty on the beach
Bathing beauty in her dressing room
Bathing beauty in the dark
On their laps, in their arms, in their beds
MADAME GIRY:
Meg, my little Meg...
PHANTOM:
(What are you saying?)
MEG:
Who helped you raise the money?
Who helped the permits come through?
Who greased the wheels of your high flying deals
Bought you time when the bills came due?
Who swayed the local bosses?
Curried favor with the press?
No, not her
And who kept singing, desperate for your favor?
Who kept dancing, hoping you would save her?
Who kept dying?
And this is what you gave her?
Now that I've got your attention at last
Here's the big finish, and then you can go!
PHANTOM:
Give me the gun, Meg
Give me the hurt and the pain and the gun, Meg
Give me the blame for not seeing the things
That you've done, Meg
Give me the gun, Meg
Give me the chance to see you clear at last
MEG:
See me clear at last
PHANTOM:
You feel ugly, you feel used
You feel broken, you feel bruised
Ah, but me, I can see all the beauty underneath
MEG:
(Yes...)
PHANTOM:
You've been robbed of love and pride
Been ignored and pushed aside
Even so, I still know there is beauty underneath
MEG:
(Yes...)
PHANTOM:
Diamonds never sparkle bright
If they aren't set just right
Beauty sometimes goes unseen
We can't all be like Christine
MEG:
(Christine, Christine...
Always Christine!)
*Meg fires the gun and shoots Christine*
(No, I didn't mean to!)
GUSTAVE:
(Mother dear! Say something!
Say anything!)
PHANTOM:
(Giry, go get help! Go!)
GUSTAVE:
(Where's Papa? He should be here! Where's Papa?)
CHRISTINE:
(Your father, your real father...)
Look with your heart and not with your eyes
The heart understands, the heart never lies
Believe what it feels and trust what it shows
Look with your heart, the heart always knows
Love is not always beautiful
Not at the start
GUSTAVE:
So open your arms
CHRISTINE:
And close your eyes tight
GUSTAVE:
Look with your heart
CHRISTINE:
And when you find love...
GUSTAVE:
(No!)
PHANTOM:
Once upon another time, our story had only begun
I had a taste of joy, the most I ever knew
Now there isn't any time and somehow our story is done
And what about the boy, what am I to do?
CHRISTINE:
Just love, just live
And give what we can give
And take the love that you deserve
CHRISTINE/PHANTOM:
Just love, just live
PHANTOM:
And give all that I have
And take what little I deserve
CHRISTINE:
Come closer, I beg you
Closer still
Remember love never dies
Kiss me one last time
PHANTOM: 
Love never dies
Love never falters
Once it has spoken
Love is yours
Love never dies
