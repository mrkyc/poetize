Pharaoh said:

Well, stone the crows, this Joseph is a clever kid
Who'd have thought that fourteen cows could mean the things he said they did?
Joseph, you must help me further, I have got a job for you
You shall lead us through this crisis, you shall be my number two

Pharaoh told his guards to fetch a chisel from the local store
Whereupon he ordered them to cut the chains that Joseph wore
Joseph got a royal pardon and a host of splendid things
A chariot of gold, a cloak, a medal and some signet rings
Joseph (Joseph)
Pharaoh's number two (Pharaoh's number two)
Joseph (Joseph)
Egypt looks to you (Egypt looks to you)
Joseph (Joseph)
Pharaoh's number two (Pharaoh's number two)
Joseph (Joseph)
Egypt looks to you (Egypt looks to you)
Joseph!
Seven summers on the trot went perfect, just as Joseph said
Joseph saw that food was gathered ready for the years ahead
Seven years of famine followed, Egypt did not mind a bit
The first recorded rationing in history was a hit

Joseph, how can we ever say
All that we want to about you?
We're so glad that you came our way
We would have perished without you

Joseph, we are the perfect team
Old buddies, that's you and me
I was wise to have chosen you
You'd be wise to agree

Joseph, how can we ever say
All that we want to about you?
We're so glad that you came our way
We would have perished without you

We were in a jam
Would have baffled Abraham
But now we're a partnership
It's just a piece of cake

Greatest man since Noah
Only goes to show ya
Anyone from anywhere can make it
If they get a lucky break

This could be a happy ending, perfect place to stop the show
Joseph, after all, has got about as far as he could go
But I'm sure that Jacob and his other sons have crossed your mind
