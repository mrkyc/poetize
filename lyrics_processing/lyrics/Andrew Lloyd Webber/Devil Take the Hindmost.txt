Miss Giry, I'm not afraid of him! I've bested him before, and if he ever had the courage to meet me face to face, man to man... No, no, it can't be

Not afraid of me, you say?

Stay back or I'll kill you, I promise you!

Of course. As you say, you've beaten me before. But that was a long time ago, Vicomte. And we were playing a different game

Look at you, deep in debt
Stinking drunk, pitiful
Shall we two make a bet?
Devil take the hindmost

Look at you, foul as sin
Hideous, horrible
Call the stakes, deal me in
Devil take the hindmost
):]
Our Christine shall choose tonight
(Let her choose!)
Is she yours or mine?
(Draw the line)
If she sings, you lose tonight
(I won't lose)
You might also like
You leave from here

Fine!
PHANTOM:
Disappear
RAOUL (spoken):
Fine!
(sung)
And if she won't?
If I win?

All your debts wiped away

Very well, let's begin

Devil take the hindmost

(You think you have the odds)
Our old game
(You think you're in control)
It's been changed
(You think you've fixed the dice)
Every throw
(Well, I will gladly roll)
Riskier
(I'll bet against the house)
All the rules
(I'll even double down)
Rearranged
Fate has redesigned most
(Fortune's on my side, I won her long ago)
Cut the deck
(I won her from you then)
Let us play
(I'll beat you even now)
You and I
(I'll win her back again)
Once again
In the end
(And when the game is done)
Either way

Devil take the hindmost
Now Christine shall choose at last
Is she yours or mine?
We've a son, our bond's secure

Are you sure?

What?

Are you so sure?

What do you mean?

Such a child, strange to see
Talented, musical

Huh?

Is he more you or me?
Which one do you find most?

You lie!

Deal the cards
(I call your bluff)
Let them fall
(The game is on)
Choose your hand
(And we will see)
Try your best
(Who wins out)
He who wins
(Once and for all)

Wins it all
Devil take the hindmost

Deal the cards!
(I call your bluff)
Let them fall
(The game is on)
Choose your hand
(And we will see)
Try your best
(Who wins out)
He who wins
(Once and for all)

Wins it all
Devil take the hindmost

(She walks, you leave together. Pockets full, debts paid. She sings... You leave alone.)
Devil take the hindmost
