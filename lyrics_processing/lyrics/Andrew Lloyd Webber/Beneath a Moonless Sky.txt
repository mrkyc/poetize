I should have known it all along
This whole arrangement bears your stamp
You're in each measure of that song
How dare you try and claim me now?
How dare you come invade my life?
Oh, Christine, my Christine
In that time when the world thought me dead
My Christine, on that night just before you were wed
Ah, Christine, you came and found where I hid
Don't you deny that you did
That long ago night
That night
Once there was a night beneath a moonless sky
Too dark to see a thing, too dark to even try
I strode to your side to tell you I must go
I couldn't see your face but sensed you even so
And I touched you
And I felt you
And I heard those ravishing refrains
The music of the past
The singing in your veins
You might also likeAnd I held you
And I touched you
And embraced you
And I felt you
And with every breath and every sigh
I felt no longer scared
I felt no longer shy
At last our feelings bared
Beneath a moonless sky
And blind in the dark, as soul gazed into soul
I looked into your heart and saw you pure and whole
Cloaked under the night with nothing to suppress
A woman and a man, no more and yet no less
And I kissed you
And caressed you
And the world around just fell away
We said things in the dark
We never dared to say
And I caught you
And I kissed you
And I took you
And caressed you
With a need too blatant to deny
And nothing mattered then
Except for you and I
Again and then again
Beneath a moonless sky
And when it was done before the sun could rise
Ashamed of what I was, afraid to see your eyes
I stood while you slept and whispered a goodbye
And slipped into the dark beneath a moonless sky
And I loved you
Yes, I loved you
I'd have followed anywhere you lead
I woke to swear my love
And found you gone instead
And I loved you
(How I loved you)
And I left you
(How I loved you)
And I had to, both of us knew why
We both knew why
And yet I won't regret
From now until I die
The night I can't forget
Beneath a moonless sky
And now
How can you talk of now?
