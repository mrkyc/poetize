Joseph's luck was really out
His spirit and his fortune low
Alone he sat, alone he thought
Of happy times he used to know
Hey, dreamer, don't be so upset
Hey, Joseph, you're not beaten yet

Go, go, go, Joseph, you know what they say
Hang on now, Joseph, you'll make it some day
Don't give up, Joseph, fight till you drop
We've read the book, and you come out on top

Now into Joseph's prison cell
Were flung two very frightened men

We don't think that we will ever
See the light of day again
Hey, Joseph, help us if you can
We've had dreams that we don't understand

Both men were servants of Pharaoh the King
Both in the doghouse for doing their thing
You might also like
One was a baker, a cook in his prime
One was a butler, the Jeeves of his time

Tell me of your dreams, my friends
And I will tell you what they show
Though I cannot guarantee
To get it right, I'll have a go

First the butler, trembling, took the floor
Nervously he spoke of what he saw

There I was standing in front of a vine
I picked some grapes, and I crushed them to wine
I gave some to Pharaoh who drank from my cup
I tried to interpret, but I had to give up

You will soon be free, my friend
So do not worry any more
The king will let you out of here
You'll buttle as you did before
Next the baker rose to tell his dream
Hoping it would have a similar theme

There I was standing with baskets of bread
High in the sky I saw birds overhead
Who flew to my baskets and ate every slice
Give me the message, like his would be nice

Sad to say your dream is not
The kind of dream I'd like to get
Pharaoh has it in for you
Your execution date is set
Don't rely on all I say I saw
It's just that I have not been wrong before

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go Joseph, you know what they say
Hang on now, Joseph, you'll make it some day
Sha la la, Joseph, you're doing fine
You and your dreamcoat ahead of your time
Go, go, go, Joseph, you know what they say
Hang on now, Joseph, you'll make it some day
Sha la la, Joseph, you're doing fine
You and your dreamcoat ahead of your time
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Joseph, you know what they say
Hang on now, Joseph, you'll make it some day
Sha la la, Joseph, you're doing fine
You and your dreamcoat ahead of your time
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Joseph, you know what they say
Hang on now, Joseph, you'll make it some day
Sha la la, Joseph, you're doing fine
You and your dreamcoat ahead of your time
Ahead of your time

Ahead of my time

Ahead of your time

Ahead of my time

Ahead of your time

Ahead of my time

Ahead of your time

Ahead of my time

Ahead of your time
