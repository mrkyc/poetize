To join me in a ritual
To prove that not only
The hand is quicker than the eye
But that the mouth is quicker than the ear
Say "hocus pocus" and we will appear
1, 2, 3, 4 kids without fear
It's a night of illusions just to state it clear
From all the words and headlines from front to rear
It's magic, that will make our talents rise
It's magic, but not apparent to eyes
It's magic, not known to any other emcee
It's magic, of course what else could it be?
While the statements we make could be conceited and grim
But what is normal to us is an illusion to them
It's magic

You got the devastating

Tito that's me
And I won't even give a clue of my ability
Don't think that I really have nothing to say
'Cause I'm so good you have to see it to believe it anyway
You might also like
You got the Mighty

Mike C most definitely
I'm somewhat of a Merlin of this time you see
You know that I'm number one and I'm not saying nothing funny
And I'll give Houdini a run for his money

And there's the Great

Peso you all should know
I make girls levitate, make a black wall glow
To a life that's right putting planes in flight
And that's just a little sample of all my might

Say boil and bubble, toil and trouble and that's the call
So you have

The greatest microphone wizard of all
Emcees are ordinary so with that I'm through
From now on I will be known as M.W
(D-L-B) The microphone wizard, y'all
(He's DLB) The spell to start the ball
Shazam!
Well I could rock a rhyme from the time nine to six
You know that I could do the same if only I had the mix
Yeah, but I could wave my hand and part the sea
But I could wink my eyes and have the girls come to me
And I could write as many lines as your little heart desire
And each and every one of us could set you on fire
I could be falling and stop in mid-air
Yeah, but I could snap my fingers and make you lose your hair
I could make you think I'm walking but I won't move an inch
And I'm the wizard of them all and that's a cinch
Well either way you wanna slice it neither one of us is playin'
And if you want we'll turn a handkerchief right into a can
And as I stand here I'll dematerialize
I keep a clap and become ten times my size
With a twitch of my nose I turn winter to spring
And turn summer to fall like it ain't no thing
Not like any other ordinary emcee
Who say how mystical and magical they may be
First we'll sock a groove to ya, then we'll prove to ya
Then only our magic is the kind that will move ya
Whether dancing or singing, rhyming or illusion
It's performed in your face, we could cause some confusion
It's magic, that will make our talents rise
It's magic, but not apparent to eyes
It's magic, not known to any other emcee
It's magic, of course what else could it be?
While the statements we make could be conceited and grim
But what is normal to us is an illusion to them
It's magic
Our grand finale starts off with a pow
To let the people know the secrets of our know-how
To say we have ESP would stretch the truth too far
So to make it plain and simple we have ESR
That's "extra special rhymes" that keeps us on top
In other words we'll succeed while other emcees flop
And along with us here on our mystical ride
Who keeps the Four in line with the social stride
The two of which all of us can confide
For the DJs we have are qualified
To make a cut so fast that you can't eye
Anything our DJ might apply
Well to your ear tonight and then to now
With a trick on the mix so you have pure sound
Well a magical force field surrounds the Four
But it's gonna fade out in a minute or more
But you know the magic words to bring us back to you
'Cause when the field fades out we'll fade out, too
That's right and I'm sorry that we're leaving my friend
But to make up for that we'll let you do the end
Now just repeat every word that will come to your ear
And like a genie in the bottle we will all disappear
Now you heard it's magic earlier in the rhyme
Now just repeat "it's magic", but make it on time
It's magic, that will make our talents rise
It's magic, but not apparent to eyes
It's magic, not known to any other emcee
It's magic, of course what else could it be?
While the statements we make could be conceited and grim
