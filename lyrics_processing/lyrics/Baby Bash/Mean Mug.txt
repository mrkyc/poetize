Now everybody gon' do it
Y'all know what's up
Look

Everybody gon' do it
When they step up in the club
Mask on tight, and it's called the mean mug
Now everybody gon' do it
I practice looking hard
Mamis, hoodrats, even superbad broads
Everybody gon' do it
Man, y'all know what it is
Face in ya face, and we do it like this

Mug on mad dawg, like I'm ready to box
But I ain't trippin' past the women and some heam on the rocks
I got a whole lot of credit and my pennies is long
I put a thizz on my face and bob my head to the song
Fall through the door with a smirk
Haters feelings gettin' hurt
Cause I pulled that main skirt
Mac Dre on my shirt
You know we fin to perk, face lookin' like I
Just smelled some grand daddy purp'
Purp'
You see
I like where I'm at, but I love where I'm goin'
I'm leaving with a half-breed Mexican and Samoan
She superbad, stuntin' hard, mean mug on her grill
Countin' feri', already steady huggin' the wheel
