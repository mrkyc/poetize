The mysteries of faith
Fossils of desire
All assume their rightful place
Is there any danger in their fire?
Is there any solace in their wake?
Could it really make a world of difference?
For goodness sake
Train rolls a cappella
To a sympathetic moon
Carrying the stories
Of every heart-earned wound
Will there be a lover at the station?
Will there be a last conductor's call?
Will there really be a happy ending after all?
To the rendezvous
Fortunes will be told
To the rendezvous
Wonders to behold
Onto a place where we can find
Maybe a trace of peace of mind
To the rendezvous all in good time
Painting the horizon
A mast beyond the blue
Caught up in the tempest
Of another point of view
Could there be a mutiny in the making?
Could it be a Lorelei in song?
Is it just a ghost that's been forgiven all along?
