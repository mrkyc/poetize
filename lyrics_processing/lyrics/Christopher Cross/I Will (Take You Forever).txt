I was a man
Who always played around in love
So quick to take
But so afraid to give enough
But now I've found the one
And heaven will only know
What only my eyes can say
And time can't take away

I was a girl
Who trusted no one with my heart
And the dreams that young girls dream
Were just vanishing in the dark
But now I've found the one
And heaven will only know
What only my eyes can say
They say

That I will (I will) take you (Take you) forever
And there will never be anyone else
In my heart but you
And I will take you forever
And there will never be anyone else but you
Anyone else but you

What only our eyes can say

That I will (I will) take you (Take you) forever

Anyone else, anyone else
That I will (I will) take you (Take you) forever
(Take you forever)
And there will never be anyone else
