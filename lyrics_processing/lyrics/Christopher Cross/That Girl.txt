But I can't shake me out of the dream
And every time that I close my eyes
I see her face like a star on the TV screen
They all keep asking 'Where you been?' after dark
I say that kinda girl she kinda grows on a heart
And I know, and I know, and I know
It doesn't come any better
That girl, she makes me sing
She gives me things that only love can bring
That girl, that girl
Oh, yeah, she makes me sing
If you think I'm losing my cool, that's true
But I bet you'd do the same
If you felt the flame of her fire
She likes to make you crazy with love
And I let her
I know it doesn't come any better
That girl, she makes me sing
She gives me things that only love can bring
That girl, that girl
Oh, yeah, she makes me sing
