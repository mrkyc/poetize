I got a couple things I'd like to say
The world's a mess and there's so much to do
And you're the one who gets to save the day
Well, I hope you'll do fine
Couldn't do much worse than this generation of mine
We had the answers but forgot that line
That says love is all
Hey, kid, with my hair and my clothes
I bet you got some big dreams up your sleeve
Well, here's a secret every old guy knows
Time goes by like you would not believe
So don't wait; make it real
Try to do some work that'll help everybody heal
I don't know much but the one thing I feel
Is that love is all
Love is all
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Go have your fun
I surely had my share
Ah, ah, ah, ah
But I'm not quite done
Look around and I might be there
With my cane and a song

Don't you let the man try to sell you another war
Give all you've got and then give some more
Because love is all
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Go have your fun
I surely had my share
Ah, ah, ah, ah
But I'm not quite done
Look around and I might be there
In the place I belong
Hey, kid, you're no fool
I know that you don't need to hear this from me
Now you're the one who decides what's cool
And it really doesn't matter if I agree
So turn it up; play it with style
Maybe learn a new chord once in a while
Practice your chops and practice your smile
And get up when you fall
And in the end, brother, please be kind
Don't believe the hate creeping into your mind
Look inside every day and I hope what you find
Is that love is all
