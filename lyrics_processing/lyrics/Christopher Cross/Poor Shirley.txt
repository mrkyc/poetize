She must hide her tears
For nobody wants to see them
Surely it will break her heart
Time passes as she waits for a friend
We'll take all the doubtful ones in the fight
And make them hold off 'til the spring
Take hold of their hallowed souls
And save them from pain, yeah yeah
All of the pain
Save ourselves from all of the pain
Dearly held are the friends
Left in the years and lost in the war
Dearly held are the loves
Save for the ones you lose on your own
We'll take all the doubtful ones in the fight
And make them hold off 'til the spring
Take hold of their hallowed souls
And save them from pain, yeah yeah
All of the pain
Save ourselves from all of the pain
Yes we will save ourselves from all of the pain
