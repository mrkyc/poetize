You gotta be cool
You gotta keep a straight face
When you're playin' the fool
You gotta wear a smile
When you're breakin' the rules
You gotta charm that snake now, baby
You gotta be smooth
You gotta be quick
I think it might just help
To be a little bit sick
You know the bite can't cut you
If the skin is thick
Charm that snake now, baby
Hey, we ain't all good lookin'
There ain't no reason
To take a good lickin'
The clock on the wall
Gonna keep on tickin'
Charm that snake now, baby
Charm that snake now, baby
Whoa, oh, oh
Don't let go of it
Don't let go
Whoa, oh, oh
Gotta charm that snake
Charm that snake
