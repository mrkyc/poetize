Both unaware of what the gods had planned
She was lost in her Cosmo reading 'bout the stars
He was reading 'bout two-headed babies from Mars
When she reached for a Snickers she dropped her keys
And so began one of life's mysteries
He was a little old-fashioned and a little oversexed
He picked them up never guessing what would happen next
Then she smiled and said I like your tie
Yeah, she smiled and told him that little white lie
And his soul lit up like the fourth of July
When she smiled
They made it to Starbuck's just before it closed
He pointed to the jar and said "You want one of those?"
So over biscotti and double decafs
They shared their stories and they had some laughs
He got up his courage, asked her back to his place
Then he held his breath as he studied her face
She just sat and she stared and she said nothing at all
He knew he blew it and he waited for the ax to fall
Then she smiled and he knew he hadn't been wrong
Yeah, she smiled and said "What took you so long?"
And the world felt good like a rock-and-roll song
When she smiled

And she smiled when he asked her to be his wife
And the future had never looked so bright
And she smiled
