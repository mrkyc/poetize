I open up my window
Open up my window
And let your love come in
Every night
I open up my window
Open up my window
And let your love come in
Every night that I'm away from you
This old bed seems way too big
And my dreams so small
Going through the motions
As I stare out from my room
I begin to realize
That we're sharing the same moon
Now every night
I open up my window
Open up my window
And let your love come in
Oh, every night
I open up my window
Open up my window
And let your love come in

Dreaming of your comfort
Fighting the lonely in my heart
And I thought I felt you touch me
In that old familiar way
When the wind came through the curtains
And I heard it call your name
So every night
I open up my window
Open up my window
And let your love come in
(Let your love come in)
Oh, every night
I open up my window
Open up my window
And let your love come in
Ooh, the time goes dragging by
Send my love across the sky
Maybe it's all that I can do
Baby, until I'll be with you
I missed you, girl, more than you'll ever know
And I kept a little vigil by my window
Oh, it's funny but it's true
Darling, I did the same for you
Now no matter where we are
We can wish upon that star
Every night
I'll open up my window
Open up my window
And let your love come in
(Let your love come in)
Oh, every night
I'll open up my window
Open up my window
And let your love come in
Oh, every night
I'll open up my window
Open up my window
And let your love come in
Oh, every night
I open up my window
Open up my window
