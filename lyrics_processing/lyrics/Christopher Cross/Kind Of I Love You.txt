What I think I'm supposed to say
To make you sure that I am worth your time
Your friends all tell you it's not true
I got no business here with you
I'm just not the man they had in mind
They may be right but it's too late now
I got you but I don't know how
I want you to see the best in me
So baby turn the lights down low
Won't you hold me, kiss me, stroke me, please me
Tell me I'm the perfect man
But if you ask me how I feel about you
It's kind of hard to understand
It's kind of I love you
It's kind of I need you
It's kind of I want you
It's kind of I don't know what I want
It's kind of I love you
It's kind of I need you
It's kind of I want you
It's kind of I don't know who I am
All my life I've spent my time
Falling in and out of love
And I always run when I find me one
I'm supposed to see the meaning of
While I'm trying to fill a grown man's shoes
I hope I don't turn away from you
But if I screw this up, forgive me
It's really the best I can do

It's kind of I need you
It's kind of I want you
It's kind of I don't know what I want
It's kind of I love you
It's kind of I need you
It's kind of I want you
It's kind of I don't know who I am
The laughter and the lace
The kindness in your face
The scent of you on my pillow when you're gone
But I'm still on this fence
And I know it makes no sense
And I'm looking to find an answer before the dawn
Yeah
Only a fool would let you go, baby
And I've been a fool too long
It's kind of I love you
It's kind of I need you
It's kind of I want you
And I care a lot more than I say
And I'm gonna love you
I know that I need you
I know that I want you
I'm tired of running away
It's kind of I love you
It's kind of I need you
It's kind of I want you
And I feel a lot more than I show
And I'm gonna love you
I know that I need you
I know that I want you
