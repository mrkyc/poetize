I know what you want and I'm sure
That it's time for you to try
And get yourself the things that are yours
'Cause it could be gone in the blink of an eye
It could be dawn in the blink of an eye
Isn't it time that you reached for the sky
And let yourself go
I've been crazy, baby
I know what you mean and I swear
That if there's a song in the night
You know I've gotta hear it out there
'Cause it could be gone in the blink of an eye
It could be dawn in the blink of an eye
Isn't it time that you reached for the sky
And let yourself go
There's a fire deep inside
I said, baby, baby
Let's steal the moon and let love have it's way
Burning like a falling star until we are
A million miles away

It could be dawn in the blink of an eye
Isn't it time that you reached for the sky
And let yourself go now
There's a fire deep inside
Let yourself go now
And forget the fears you hide
Let yourself go now
(In the blink of an eye)
And forget the tears you cried
And when you needed me
Did I just turn away?
(Did I just turn away?)
And when I spoke my heart
Is there something I forgot to say
(Something I forgot to say)
It could be gone in the blink of an eye
It could be dawn in the blink of an eye
Isn't it time that you reached for the sky
And let yourself go
In the blink of an eye
It could be dawn in the blink of an eye
Isn't it time that you reached for the sky
And let yourself go now
There's a fire deep inside
Let yourself go now

And forget the tears you cried
And let yourself go now

There's a fire deep inside
Let yourself go now
