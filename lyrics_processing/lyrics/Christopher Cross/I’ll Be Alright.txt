Just can't seem to shake those ordinary blues
One thing I can tell you
Is hold your spirit tight
Something's on the move
It's gonna be alright
I'll be alright
I'm a man with his mind in motion
I'll be alright
I've got the will to live
I'll be alright
I'm a man with his mind in motion
I'm gonna give it all I've got to give

I kept stepping on my wings
The tears, the time, the trouble
I had to take a stand
I found my way to land

Sometimes I think I live by miracles alone
Click those ruby slippers and hope to be back home
Say just where I'll find you
And that's just where I'll be
Building me an igloo by the sea
I'll be alright
I'll be alright
I'll be alright
I'm gonna give it all I've got to give
I'm gonna give it all I've got to give
