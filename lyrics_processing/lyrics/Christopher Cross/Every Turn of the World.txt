Will it come again
We think of all the things we want
Will we ever win
We listen to the voice of children
Will they find their way
Keep an open heart
The answer to it all's a wish away
Never let the tears you're crying blind you
To the dream that's waiting to find you
'Cause there's one more chance
With every turn of the world
Is it gold or glory, a taste of freedom
Or the strong warm touch of a body
There are all these things
With every turn of the world
Human kindness, diamond of the heart
Tearing down the old walls
As long as we can share
Desire's not a sin after all, oh-oh
When you find yourself alone
Missing tender magic touching you
Keep an open heart
Everything you dream can still be true
