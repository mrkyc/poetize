Where the love can't cool the anger
So many times settled with a kiss
Love in trouble; the trouble is you and me
Strong words so nonchalant
Come on, we don't mean half of what we say
You say you like getting what you want; me too
But I, I'll never say I never want to love you again
Don't you say goodbye
Don't you say goodbye
When you're walking out that door
Don't you say goodbye
Don't you say goodbye
Baby, don't you say goodbye
It's not a matter of weak or strong
Arms can hold you or they can hold you down
But I can dance to the saddest song
But I won't let you stay where you don't belong
Oh, so while you're out there busy being free
Just remember one of those roads leads back to me
Back to me
Don't you say goodbye
Don't you say goodbye
When you're walking out that door
Be careful what you say
You might be back someday
Baby, don't you say goodbye

But I'll let you go
If you want it that way
It's your choice
But my voice
Will whisper every day
Every step of the way
Don't you say goodbye
Girl, I'll tell you why
It just might turn out that way
Don't you say goodbye
Even with your eyes
Baby, don't you say goodbye
I know you care somewhere
Inside you hide the truth away
(Behind a thin disguise)
Your heart will change your mind someday
Baby, don't you say goodbye
Don't you say goodbye
Don't you say goodbye
When you're walking out that door
Be careful what you say
You might be back someday
Baby, don't you say goodbye
Baby, don't you say goodbye
