Thinkin' 'bout you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Thinkin' 'bout
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Thinkin' 'bout all the things that couldn't come true
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
And how much I'll miss having you to talk to
Now that I'm on my own
I don't need to hold you
But I'd love to
There's beauty in monochrome
I promise not to linger
But somehow lately
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Thinkin' 'bout all those things we put ourselves through
Incompatibly
Playing out our restless parts so crazy and free
Those nights when we talked 'til the sun
We had all the answers
We were dancers
Then time caught us both on the run
In our own directions
Headed for the moon

And I know that you think of me too
All is well
Honey, but I'm just sittin' here thinkin' 'bout you
Thinkin' 'bout you
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
How you said you'd never change and hoping it's true
In your impetuous way
You brought out the kind of fire still with me today
When you told me you had to go
Off to chase the rainbow
Oh, it hurt me so
The pain didn't kill me though
I will always be here
The soul outlives the heart
I know you
And I know that you think of me too
All is well
Honey, but I'm just sittin' here thinkin' 'bout you
There was a time when our lives were a tangle
Between our hands and Jacob's ladder
Nothing mattered
Indelible and dear
Indelible and dear
I know you
And I know that you think of me too
All is well
Honey, but I'm just sittin' here thinkin' 'bout you
I know you
And I know that you think of me too
All is well
Oh, honey, but I'm just sittin' here thinkin' 'bout you
I'm just sittin' here thinkin' 'bout you
I'm just sittin' here thinkin' 'bout you
Thinkin' 'bout you
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
