I see pictures of the day we met
I keep wishing on the falling stars
To forget you but it hasn't happened yet
And I still remember when you walked away
It was more than my heart could believe
Careless wind blew the smell of your perfume away
But the touch of you, it never leaves
So I'll never stop believing
Someday your love is coming back to me
No, I'll never stop believing
Someday that you'll be coming back to me
Everybody in my life
They say forget that girl, she's gone for good
How can I explain this heart
It just keeps hanging on 'cause something says it should
Oh, I go on remembering how good we were
The sweetest days I'll ever know
This careless boy, somehow he let you get away
But the touch of you, he'll never let it go
So I'll never stop believing
Someday your love is coming back to me
No, I'll never stop believing
Someday that you'll be coming back to me
