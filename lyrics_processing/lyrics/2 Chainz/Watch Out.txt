Yo, okay

All my niggas with me, all my niggas with it
All my niggas ballin', all my niggas athletic
All my niggas A1, all got street cred
All my niggas ballin', all my niggas athletic
Pulled up in a Phantom, pulled off with a dancer
Got a pocket full of money, kinda hard to keep my pants up
Nigga tryna run them bands up, fuck a bitch with my hands up
Lil Quay fuck the Xans up, kinda hard to understand her
Duffle bags in the Escalade, call the bitch there a bread truck
Got the bitch going retarded, call Uber for a spare truck
All these niggas never scared us, all these niggas never ran up
Bitch tryna put the head on me, niggas tryna put the Feds on me
Niggas tryna take meds on me, everything for the players only
Niggas sunny like Arizona, gunshots just for sayin' something
Spraying shit like aerosol, you a foul and that's a fair ball
Nigga can't reach the goals, keep shootin' them damn air balls

Watch out, lil ho, my partners still smoke on parole
They say that I'm crazy, I used to talk to a stove
I tell it to lock, shit, I tell it a lot
Go to the dealership, fishtail off the lot
You know I'm comin' straight out the block
You know I'm comin' straight of the top
Shawty said she want five million
'Cause I told her to leave and called her a thot
Shit, you can like it or not, damn, I'm comin' straight out the pot
Still got some Act' in my stock, nigga I ain't gotta lie
Nigga I ain't gotta try, you wavin' that thing in the sky?
We wavin' that thing at your body
We wavin' that thing at your eye
Look at the watch on my wrist, got 'em all watchin' my wrist
Told that lil bitch I'll pass, nigga watch the assist
I run the trap like the marathon, you niggas softer than silicone
You know what it's like when the feelin' gone
I know what it's like when the ceilin' gone
I had a sit down with Farrakhan
Turn the White House to the Terrordome
I used to serve at the Chevron
I used to serve with my necklace on, bitch!
