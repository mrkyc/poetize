Girl I'm on that clean shit, you already know
You ain't never seen this, I'm ready to go
I got em saying, I, I, I, I, I, I
I know I've been away
But I, I, I, I, I, I
I'm in your city today

I know you love me
And I know you're down
Cuz we always end up fucking every time I'm in town
Every time I'm in town (Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)
Every time I'm in town (Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)

Baby I just landed, you gon pick me up
Heard you like to squirt, I might lick it up
Conspicuous, I speed it up
And I slow it down like I'm on Robitussin
I'm known for crushin', you're known for blushin'
Oh what was that
You blowing kisses, I throw em back, pull into that culdesac
Back then no chauffeur, back seat like a sofa
One leg on my shoulder, other leg and it's over
You might also like
I know you love me
And I know you're down
Cuz we always end up fucking very time I'm in town
Every time I'm in town (Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)
Every time I'm in town (Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)

Met her once and you missed me, girl you crazy
No makeup on, you're still pretty lady
And you beautiful, inside and outside
I don't know if I should buy my wife a house, or make you my house wife
You call me, I come through
You pass out, I come too
Dippin it like fondue, spinach dip, cheese stick
Appetizers, entrees, it's you in that lingerie
As far as race, you're first place, I'm only in town for one day

I know you love me
And I know you're down
Cuz we always end up fucking very time I'm in town
Every time I'm in town (Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)
Every time I'm in town (Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)

Girl I'm on that clean shit, you already know
You ain't never seen this, I'm ready to go
I got em saying, I, I, I, I, I, I
I know I've been away
But I, I, I, I, I, I
I'm in your city today
