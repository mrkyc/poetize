We are wound up like a clock
Rollin' like we rock
Comin' out to play (Say, "Hey")
Kids just buzzin' like a wire
The roof is getting higher
Ain't nothing in our way (Say, "Hey")
When we hear the bass
We'll be losing our minds (Say, "Hey")
First note of our song
It's the one that goes like

Say hey, hey, hey
We're gonna make it shake tonight
Just dance your fears away
Say hey, hey, hey
Who cares if we are wrong or right?
We're living for today
Say hey, hey, hey
While our song is on, everything's okay
Say hey, hey, hey
We're gonna make it shake tonight
We're doing it our way
Say hey, hey
You might also like
We, we just can't relax
Crank it to the max
Let go of yesterday (Say, "Hey")
Drums crashin' through the floor
Swingin' on a chord
Scream until it breaks (Say, "Hey")
Everybody shout
There's no need to pretend (Say, "Hey")
If it stops, we're just gonna do it again

Say hey, hey, hey
We're gonna make it shake tonight
Just dance your fears away
Say hey, hey, hey
Who cares if we are wrong or right?
We're living for today
Say hey, hey, hey
While our song is on, everything's okay
Say hey, hey, hey
We're gonna make it shake tonight
We're doing it our way
Say hey, hey, hey
Oh, yeah (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Come on
We shine so bright like laser lights
The stars align for us tonight
It never ends, just hit replay
So we can always feel this way
One, two, one, two, three, four go!

Say hey, hey, hey
We're gonna make it shake tonight
Just dance your fears away
Say hey, hey, hey
Who cares if we are wrong or right?
We're living for today
Say hey, hey, hey
While our song is on, everything's okay
Say hey, hey, hey
We're gonna make it shake tonight
We're doing it our way
