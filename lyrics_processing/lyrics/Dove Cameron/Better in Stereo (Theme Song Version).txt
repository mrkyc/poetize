Better in stereo
Better in stereo
Better in stereo
B-b-better in stereo

I'm up with the sunshine (Let's go)
I lace up my high-tops (Oh, no)
Slam dunk, ready or not
Yeah, show me what you got
I'm under the spotlight (Alright)
I dare you, "Come on, and follow"
You dance to your own beat
I'll sing the melody

When you say, "Yeah"
I'll say, "No"
When you say, "Stop"
All I wanna do is go, go, go

You, you
The other half of me, me
The half I'll never be-e
The half that drives me crazy
You, you
The better half of me, me
The half I'll always nee-ed
And we both know we're better in stereo
(We're better in stereo
B-b-better in stereo)
You might also like
And when we're together (Oh, yeah)
The sweet harmony, oh, so rare
If we could just agree, we would go Major League

But you say, "Yeah"
I'll say, "No"
When you say, "Stop"
All I wanna do is go, go, go (Go-o-o)

You, you
The other half of me, me
The half I'll never be-e
The half that drives me crazy
You, you
The better half of me, me
The half I'll always nee-eed
And we both know, we're better in stereo

You say it's wrong, I say it's right
You say it's black, I say it's white
You take a left, I take a right
But at the end of the day we both know
You, you (You, you)
Me, me (Me, me)
You, you
We both know (We both know)
You, you
(We're better in stereo)
Me, me
(We're better in stereo)
You, you
We both know

You, you
The other half of me, me
The half I'll never be-e
The half that drives me crazy
You, you
The better half of me, me
The half I'll always nee-ed
