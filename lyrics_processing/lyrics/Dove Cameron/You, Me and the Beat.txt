No, you don't need a reason
Just get up and dance
When you turn up the music
Let it blast
You know we've got whole world
In the palm of our hands
Don't let it go
Don't let it go
Don't let it go

'Cause now
You're livin' life out loud
With your head up in the clouds
Yeah, it feels so right, right now, now, now

You and me and the beat, go great together
You and me and the beat, go great together
You and me and the beat, go great together
You and me and the beat, go great together now
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Hey), ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Hey)
You and me go great together, now
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Hey), ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Hey)
You and me go great together
You might also like
Anything can happen
Any time or place
From the floor to the rafters
To outer space
We can move any mountain
Just push the pace
Just let it flow
Just let it flow
Just let it flow

'Cause now
Just live your life out loud
With your head up in the clouds
Yeah, it feels so right, right now, now, now

You and me and the beat, go great together
You and me and the beat, go great together
You and me and the beat, go great together
You and me and the beat, go great together now
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Hey), ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Hey)
You and me go great together
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Hey), ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Hey)
You and me go great together
When we're together, somehow it works
And having real friends makes it worth it
And in the future, when we both look through that rearview mirror
We'll know we had good times

You and me and the beat, go great together
You and me and the beat, go great together
You and me and the beat, go great together
You and me and the beat, go great together now
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Hey), ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Hey)
You and me go great together
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Hey), ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Hey)
