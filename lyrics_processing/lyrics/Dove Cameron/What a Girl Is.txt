On a scale from one to ten
I am perfect like I am
I don't need your number
We don't need your number
And the stupid magazines
Want me to change my everything
They don't even matter
They're not taking my power

I'm so over all of these voices around
They've said enough, it's my turn, let's get loud

I'll show you what a girl is
'Cause all of me is perfect
Who cares about a dress size?
It's all about what's inside
I'll stand up now
And won't back down
We're breaking through the surface
To show you what a girl-irl is

We are flawless in our skin
Your words don't mean anythin'
I'm done wasting my time
I can make up my own mind (I can make up my own mind)

You are exactly what you're made to be, I swear
Don't be afraid just to put yourself out there

I am perfect like I am
I don't need your number
We don't need your number

I'll show you what a girl is (Show you what a girl is)

Who cares about a dress size? (No, no)
It's all about what's inside (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'll stand up now

We're breaking through the surface
To show you what a girl is (To show you what a girl is)
We're breaking through the surface (Oh, yeah, yeah)
