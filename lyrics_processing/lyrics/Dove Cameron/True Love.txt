If I could do it all over, baby, I'd do it different
Maybe I wouldn't be here, in this position
I found you and I lost you, looking back is torture
And it hurts to know I let you go
You live right around the corner
And I could've had it all, could've had it all

True love, I knew I had it
True love was so hard to find
True love, if I could get it back
I'd never let it go this time
True love is an inspiration
True love, it was mine, oh, mine
True love, if I could get it back
I'd never let it go
I'd never let it go this time

Feeling it all around me, wondering how I blew it
And I wanna know the secret of how they do it
No such thing as perfection, I'm still learning that lesson
To forgive is key to forgetting me
And I'm staring at my reflection
And I could've had it all, could've had it all

True love, I knew I had it
True love was so hard to find
True love, if I could get it back
I'd never let it go this time
True love is an inspiration
True love, it was mine, oh, mine
True love, if I could get it back
I'd never let it go
I'd never let it go this time

If I knew then what I do now, I'd be with you tonight
If I knew then what I'd do now, we'd be alright
I could've had it all, could've had it all
Could've had it all, could've had it all

True love, I knew I had it
True love was so hard to find (Could've had it all)
True love, if I could get it back
I'd never let it go this time (I'd never let it go)
True love is an inspiration
True love, it was mine, oh, mine
True love, if I could get it back, yeah
If only I could get it back, I'd

True love, yeah
If I could get it back, I'd never let it go this time

I'd never let it go this time
