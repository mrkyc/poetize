On a scale from one to ten
I am perfect like I am
I don't need your number
We don't need your number
And the stupid magazines
Want me to change my everything
They don't even matter
They're not taking my power (They're not taking my power)

I'm so over all of these voices around
They've said enough, it's my turn, let's get loud

I'll show you what a girl is
'Cause all of me is perfect
Who cares about a dress size?
It's all about what's inside (It's all about what's inside)
I'll stand up now
And won't back down
We're breaking through the surface
To show you what a girl-irl is

I'm feelin' flawless in our skin
Your words don't mean anythin'
I'm done wasting my time (I'm done wasting my time)
I can make up my own mind (I can make up my own mind)

You are exactly what you're made to be, I swear
Don't be afraid just to put yourself out there

It's pretty clear that you won't see us on the sidelines (No)
We're gonna take it over, standin' like a high-rise (Yeah)
And if you ever doubt-a what a girl can do
Sit back and let us show ya, it's been really nice to know ya
No doubt, we're a force that's undeniable (No)
Get together, we'll rule this house, rain down on ya (Boom)
I've got a feeling that we're gonna be there for ya
Sit back and let us show ya, 'cause the girls are taking over
On a scale from one to ten
I am perfect like I am

We don't need your number

I'll show you what a girl is (Show you what a girl is)
'Cause all of me is perfect (All of me is perfect)
Who cares about the dress size? (No, no)
It's all about what's inside (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'll stand up now (Stand up now)
And won't back down (Won't back down)
We're breaking through the surface (Breaking through the surface)
To show you what a girl-irl is (To show you what a girl is)

We're breaking through the surface (No, no, yeah)
