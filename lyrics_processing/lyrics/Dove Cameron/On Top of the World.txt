If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here, cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when well
Then again it just depends on
How long the time is left for you

I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest river
You can have it all, but life keeps movin'
Now, take it in, but don't look down

'Cause I'm on top the world, ay!
I'm on top of the world, ay!
Waitin' on this for a while now
Payin' my dues to the dirt
I've been waitin' to smile, ay!
Been holdin' it in for a while, ay!
Take it with me if I can
Been dreamin' of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

I've tried to cut these corners
Tried to take the easy way out
I've kept on fallin' short of somethin'
I coulda' gave up then, but
Then again, I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for somethin'
You might also like
I take it in, but don't look down

'Cause I'm on top the world, ay!
I'm on top of the world, ay!
Waitin' on this for a while now
Payin' my dues to the dirt
I've been waitin' to smile, ay!
Been holdin' it in for a while, ay!
Take it with me if I can
Been dreamin' of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

(Wow-whoa
Oh, oh)
I'm on top of the world
(Wow-whoa
Oh, oh)

'Cause I'm on top the world, ay!
I'm on top of the world, ay!
Waitin' on this for a while now
Payin' my dues to the dirt
I've been waitin' to smile, ay!
Been holdin' it in for a while, ay!
Take it with me if I can
Been dreamin' of this since a child
I'm on top of the world
And I know it's hard when you're fallin' down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
Get up, now
Get up
Get up, now
And I know it's hard when you're fallin' down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
Get up, now
Get up
Get up, now

'Cause I'm on top the world, ay!
I'm on top of the world, ay!
Waitin' on this for a while now
Payin' my dues to the dirt
I've been waitin' to smile, ay!
Been holdin' it in for a while, ay!
Take it with me if I can
Been dreamin' of this since a child
