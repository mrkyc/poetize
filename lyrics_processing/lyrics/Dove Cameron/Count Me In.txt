Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

If I'm the sun, then you're the moon
If you're the words, then I'm the tune, yeah
If you're the heart, then I'm the beat
Somehow together, we're complete, yeah

There are times my world is crumbling and the rain is crashing down
But everywhere you are, the sun comes out

Even when you're gone
I feel you close
You'll always be the one
I love the most
You're in my heart, on my mind
You are underneath my skin
And anywhere, anytime that you need anything
Count me in
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Count me in, yeah, yeah (Oh, oh)

I don't need to say a word, no
'Cause you know when I'm happy and when I'm hurt
We're close as pages in a book
'Cause you make me feel better with just one look
You might also like
There are times my world is crumbling and the rain is crashing down
But everywhere you are, the sun comes out

Even when you're gone
I feel you close
You'll always be the one
I love the most
You're in my heart, on my mind
You are underneath my skin
And anywhere, anytime that you need anything
Count me in
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Count me in, yeah, yeah (Oh, oh)

'Cause we're two halves of the same new heart
That beats to our own drum
You're the shadow always by my side
One that sometimes knows me better than I know myself
And I wish that you were here with me tonight
Even when you're gone
I feel you close
You'll always be the one
I love the most
I love the most
You're in my heart, on my mind
You are underneath my skin
And anywhere, anytime that you need anything
Count me in
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Count me in, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Count me in
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
