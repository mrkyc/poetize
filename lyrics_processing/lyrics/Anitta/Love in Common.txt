Lately, we just don't have love in common
It was good but it's been bad a bit too often
Lately, we just don't have love

We're still drinking the same brand of tequila
We got all the same photos and friends on our phones
I don't like small talk, you don't like it either
But you say, "Hold on, baby"
I say, "Let go" (Hmm)

Ooh, ooh
It just don't feel the same that it did
Ooh, ooh

Lately, we just don't have love in common
It was good, but it's been bad a bit too often
The fact that you don't see it it's a problem
Ain't nobody's fault
We don't have love in common
Lately, we just don't have love

It's a road and I don't know where it's going
Head out the window and hope for the best
Highs lead to falling and falls lead to broken
Heart's feeling heavy inside of my chest (Hmm)

Ooh, ooh
It just don't feel the same that it did
Ooh, ooh

Lately, we just don't have love in common
It was good, but it's been bad a bit too often
The fact that you don't see it it's a problem
Ain't nobody's fault
We don't have love in common
Lately, we just don't have love

Ooh, ooh
Lately, we just don't have love
Lately, we just don't have love
Ooh, ooh
Lately, we just don't have love
Lately, we just don't have love

We could just pretend
Smile while we are fading
'Round and 'round again
All of these nights we're wasting
We could just pretend
But I hear the silence breaking
Lately, we just don't have love in common
It was good, but it's been bad a bit too often
The fact that you don't see it it's a problem
Ain't nobody's fault
We don't have love in common
Lately, we just don't have love in common
It was good, but it's been bad a bit too often
The fact that you don't see it it's a problem
Ain't nobody's fault
We don't have love in common
