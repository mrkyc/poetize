So love me, love me, love me, love me like you mean it, oh, yeah

You don't have to go back home, stay for a little bit
I might need more
This time is bigger than the one before
What'd you do without it?
One more time, we call in sick and then I make you mine
This time, it's different, I can't lie
I need you around me

Baby, do you feel me
Getting closer to your chin?
Come on and up and kiss me
'Cause I know that you know better
It's not because I know me
I'm doing well since you're here
Let's make it last forever, baby

No, I won't say no
'Cause I don't know how to hold me
Now you're never on me
We can take it slow, slow
