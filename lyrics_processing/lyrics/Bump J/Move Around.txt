Yo Bumpy, I just want to make sure everybody knew who did the track
Kanye-to-the, with the GOON SQUAD!

Shawty you know the game's about picking and choosing
You don't know when you won you so used to losing
Move around (now!), move around (now!)
Move around (now!), move around (move!)
I know you see me tryna party homey, give me that room
Don't make me up this 40 on me and click-ta-clack-boom!
Move around (now!), move around (now!)
Move around (now!), move around (move!)

I ain't going back to doing a book a day
I'm at this rap full time, my future's looking great
Feds not convinced, think I'm still moving weight
Move around clowns, don't even look my way
Bump's a hustla, got cheddar to check in
You real you would die for whatever you reppin'
You smart, you would carry a weapon
Mines'll make you do a back flip better than Mary Lou Retton
I'll shoot something up, I'm from Grimmyville
You know it's shoes on that truck if I'm behind the wheel
They know me and so I got it locked I remind them still
Cause every line that I put up in a rhyme is real
And you wonder why the label shoot you down
Your album will never leave the shelf cause you's a clown
Look at me, flicking something serious through the town
You rap niggas couldn't be serious, move around now
You might also like
Shawty you know the game's about picking and choosing
You don't know when you won you so used to losing
Move around (now!), move around (now!)
Move around (now!), move around (move!)
I know you see me tryna party homey, give me that room
Don't make me up this 40 on me and click-ta-clack-boom!
Move around (now!), move around (now!)
Move around (now!), move around (move!)

See there, it ain't popping 'less we there
Your barking better stop before I hit you with the three squared
That's a nine if you failed math, I bail pass in that pale Jag
Cause I push weight and you sell bags
Come and cop that from me
My diesel have cluckers nodding off like they ain't slept in weeks
You ever disrespect the chief
I'll have the Tec put you pets to sleep
That's all you birds I catch singing to detects police
You ain't my dogs, you rats and you cats could rest in peace
I post up on a deck for weeks
You can ask K. West, I'm a masterpiece
I got a good name, and I spit good game
Tried ya baby mama out, and she got good brains
I look lames in the face and tell 'em
You ain't a goon, you's a fruit, I'm a gangsta mella
Shawty you know the game's about picking and choosing
You don't know when you won you so used to losing
Move around (now!), move around (now!)
Move around (now!), move around (move!)
I know you see me tryna party homey, give me that room
Don't make me up this 40 on me and click-ta-clack-boom!
Move around (now!), move around (now!)
Move around (now!), move around (move!)

Look, I got a crazy flow so while you hatin' Joe
I'm off in Mexico posing, frozen H20
Around my neck and wrists, a couple ladies so
If I was the golden knight, it's all gravy Joe
Went from the US to USSR
In the best private jets nigga, you just test cars
But when I am on my land, I'm stylin'
My rims chop like a karate man from Shaolin
And the Goons hit the club and pile in
We in these streets wildin', chumps where ya'll been?
We move around, I'm off on the islands sipping daiquiris
See why you niggas so mad at me
I'm enjoying the rewards of this hip hop
On the West Coast in my tank top and flip-flops
Smoking some you can smell through the Ziploc
Never find another nigga this hot, no
Shawty you know the game's about picking and choosing
You don't know when you won you so used to losing
Move around (now!), move around (now!)
Move around (now!), move around (move!)
I know you see me tryna party homey, give me that room
Don't make me up this 40 on me and click-ta-clack-boom!
Move around (now!), move around (now!)
Move around (now!), move around (move!)
Chicago, Bump J
Rappers, move around, it's my turn
