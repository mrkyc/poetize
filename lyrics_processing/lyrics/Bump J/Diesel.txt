Weed rocks blow spark, I've been goin hard
Ever since I had that Cutlass on them Lowenharts
All I need is a plug, I'll flood Noah's Ark
Them killers kill with no regard
I tell them soldiers march
The stick-up game hit or miss, tryin to hit a lick
'll tear your whole house down just to get a brick
If you don't remember nothin else, just remember this
That coke'll get you famous, heroin'll get you rich

I know a nigga used to take it to the table, bag it
Without a mask and glove, rushin, he had major traffic
Been dippin' in the pack, puttin it in his nasal passage
Damn, look like you got yourself a table habit
I see them killers been busy, better seal the streets
They won't kill for Obama but they'll kill for me
They'll steal from they mama 'fore they steal from me
I kill the beat, the same killers gonna fill the seats
The show gone, I'm performin with my pole on
I can't make it rain but I can make it snowstorm
I tried to give these niggas game, ain't no hope for 'em
You's a lame, your niggas pussies and your hoe gone
I face the East, place my right over my left hand
I'm married to them streets, that FN is my best man
Showed up in my Polo tee and my sweatpants
Looked the devil in the eye, told her let's dance

Jeezy the snowman, Bump the blowman
The barrel on that Desert Eagle look like a coke can
Wish you could see this fuckin line but you ain't off the bed
Six in the mornin, block look like the walking dead
Yeah, ten bands for a hundred grams
Times that times ten you got a hundred grand
The shit I got could take a nine so I Uncle Sam
"You Uncle Sam?" Yeah I tax 'em, now you understand?
Let me tell you the story, this guy was chasin highs
With a needle in his arm, scowl on his face he died
Fiends heard how he died, now they can't wait to try it
I swear to God man, they come across the state to buy it
Damn, what kind of stuff could do that
It's the rush, it's the brush, shit like russian roulette
And I give 'em no revolver, they know what to do next
It go click and I bang and we rushin through the deck, shoppin

Weed rocks blow spark, I've been goin hard
Ever since I had that Cutlass on them Lowenharts
All I need is a plug, I'll flood Noah's Ark
Them killers kill with no regard
I tell them soldiers march
The stick-up game hit or miss, tryin to hit a lick
