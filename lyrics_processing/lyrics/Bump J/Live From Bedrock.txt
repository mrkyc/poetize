A couple of my brothers, one of them that died
Had came up with it, it was just some...
We was just always some hood niggas but we would just be on some big things
Whether it's just big ol money, big ol rims, big ol jewelry
We was just big ol niggas
Know'm sayin, we was lil niggas
Big ol guns, just all everything was big
We was big ol niggas...

The city rain blood in the summertime
I'm runnin round with this gun that shoots a hundred times
I've done the crime, took my lick, went and done my time
I look at you and your face and you know what comes to mind?
Fool, stain, sweet, chopstick
I catch you, slap you wit that banger then go in your pockets
I used to go in there, cop it then turn over a profit
That money start runnin in and ain't know when to stop it
Got it, get that perrico from Mexico
A heavy dose and flood the city like the levies broke
They plottin on me heavy yo, I'm so ready tho
I keep that iron everywhere we go
Live, live from Bedrock
Live from Bedrock
See if you can survive a headshot
Live, live from Bedrock

Was the memories really worth the paper
Told Shake I had the perfect caper
These verses baby only hit me if it's work related
Diamond's on me doin the percolator
We live, live...
I ball hard like Russell Westbrook
It's no wonder I got the summer sold
Winter as well
I spent eight winters having dinner in hell
And I remember it well
That's why my foot up on the gas, it ain't comin off
The realest nigga you gon run across
Got that money doin somersaults
I'm not one of these rap niggas that act
Like they one of these trap niggas that trap
Like they was really that nigga
I'm only into dealing with facts nigga
I really had a sack, get you stuck up and whacked nigga
Jesus, they just done over the season
Think you teflon, I blow you to pieces
Look at me, why would I hate
I'm doin shit my way
You know what a haza is? A pig that don't fly straight
Goodbye, Frank
And these niggas thought I fell off, hell naw
I was busy in the underworld knockin bells off
Knockin yale wall till I took a L all the shame
Catch em listenin for my name
Doin mail call
Pray for me, mama, pray for me
While she put all her faith in that church
I'm out chasin this paper faithfully
Started with that damn eigth of ki
Told myself I wasn't lookin back
As a man of my word I raped the streets
Yeah, yeah I raped the streets
My circle small and just as loyal as they can be
Only the fam, family go head and take a seat
Yeah pull up a chair, let's share a toast have a plate to eat
I do this for my niggas that was with me way before that money
I do this for you hatin niggas, ooh you know you funny
I sit back and laugh at ya, don't know what it takes to be true
Full of hatred, I would hate to be you
GSG boy we that mafia
Thought it was over when they locked me up
That couldn't be further from the truth, nigga I body ya
This shit is murder in the booth
You full of hatred, I would hate to be you
GSG yeah we the mafia
Eastside crazy
