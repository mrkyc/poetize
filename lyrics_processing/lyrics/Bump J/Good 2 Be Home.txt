It feels good to be home I know you miss me (I hope you miss me)
I don't see any of these niggas fucking with me, I'm sure you don't either if so convince me
Shoutout to them big ole' niggas who rollin' with me

Still on papers, fuck them papers boy that pole is with me
And hold a 50, yeah I know the city
Ole' 71st street, the devil that birthed me, to carry that 30
Put yo ears to the streets you hear em' beggin' for mercy?
Momma yo' boys home!
Parked the Rolls in the middle of the war zone
Whoa whoa, they shoulda never let me out the feds
Its gonna run you a 100 to get me out the bed
Instead of eatin' they steady beefin' without the bread
Meanwhile, I'm chasin' green down til we out the red
Oh my, this crown's heavy this throne's cold
I made it back its been a long road
Agents pulled me over took me in my life was on hold
Told me they would let me go, I tell em' what they wanna know?
I told them bitches fuck you, then I stared at em' stone cold
You get put under that pressure bet you gon' fold
Million dollar deals down the drain, I still got a name
Still got my integrity, we know that'll never leave
Look, these niggas scared of me
They better be, just let em' be
Cross me like the letter T, I'm comin' after U like the letter V
I was tearin' chicken folds on that Rolls, make it sit up like a SUV
You want it you gotta grind for it, niggas out here dyin' for it
Music need change yeah its time for it, why not a crime lord?
Me and Ye put the city on before was Twista
Before him was Common and Kellz man we owe them niggas
Now my youngstas holdin' it down and I'm rollin' with em'
Don't listen to these older niggas they just old and bitter
You know who's with you when you down and they supposed to get up
These niggas a turn they back and these hoes a switch up
Just keep on holdin' us down boy I'm rollin' with ya
