Bro, he got me on the hook, this not a feature
Time to beast up in the streets, you scared of creatures

When I'm on the block, a nigga never see you
They gon' run up on you with the Desert Eagle
I know, monsters
But shots like laser tag
And you was all up in they face, and brag
And now they're ready to murder you like a feind when they chase the dragon
And I'm killin' them, monsters

OG on 'em can you smell that?
Pull up on 'em in the Hellcat
Monsters (Look)

Got a baby .9 in my right pocket (Yeah)
But I ain't gotta ride, my youngins slide like ice hockey (Uh-huh)
Gotta break a D, and the color brown just like Fox (Ya dig?)
Them shortys with me, gon' heat a nigga, it's like coffee
Nigga, you ain't never seen me on Twitter beefin' (Nah)
My nerves bad, so that'll lead to a nigga leakin' (Facts)
My pockets decent, niggas know that I'm sellin' pieces (Uh-huh)
Your dough right, I deliver to you like a stack of pizzas (Facts)
Money comin' so them dumpers on us
Lot of niggas talkin', they don't really want it (Right)
See a lick, and were quick to hit it

Young, young nigga
Keep a gun with him
Keep a drum with him
Can't do nun' with him
You in front line, in the slums with him
You get ran over if you don't run with him
Gucci, Louis, Prada
Runnin' through these dollars
We was just some toddlers
Runnin' through the projects
Needin' all my partners
Runnin' through the product
All we do is profit
All we do deposit
Blood money for these big faces
Got blood on him, thirsty, I need somethin'
Knock a redbone
Ski-mask and my gloves on, finna rob some'
We win it, we win it, we up
The team 'bout to dub some'
Blowin' out for the buzz comin'
You's a duck, I go duck huntin'
FN Five-seven, slug some'
Shorty, I love the head
I damn near love it like I love money
Cross me, I will send them boys to hunt you
Trust me, you will not enjoy your summer
Chase you down with that kickstand
Better pray to god that that bitch jam
Chop you down then i switch hands
Big ol' nigga with some big bands
