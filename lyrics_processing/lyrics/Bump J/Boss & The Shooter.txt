Yeah, these are my confessions
Winnin' these checks and perfection's a few of my obsessions
I'm not playin' any games, so who are my contestants?
Exactly, just some peasants out tryin' to block my blessings
Flexin', I just dropped the bag off in Louie V
Poppin' tags just too cool with me, couple racks for gratuity
Yeah, ain't no diplomatic immunity
I get popped with this shit in this bag and them crackers losin' me
Niggas know not to play with me, keep they K with me
I ain't gon' send no shorties off, I let that .40 off
I ain't finna put no bag on a nigga
Run up with that super soaker, let it splash on a nigga

I'm the boss (I'm the boss)
And the shooter (and the shooter)

I'm still gon' be the nigga lettin' off all the shots (all the shots)
Stay out my way (stay out my way)

Yeah, I am so ruthless
I like that Givenchy I might send in them boosters
I don't go back and forth typin' on my computer
Bend the corner like the slickers hop out and hallelujah
Blessed him, he caught the Holy Ghost
I'm to the head with that Patron I'm bout to overdose
How'd you behave I was betrayed by those who know me most?
How niggas stuntin' on the 'gram when we know he broke?
Sickenin', if Bump got it we all shine, it's ball time
Big money or small time I need all mine
I ain't finna play no games with a nigga
Run up with that Phillip Drummond let it bang on a nigga

I'm the boss (I'm the boss)

Ask the folks they love me just like they love Hoover
Ask the moes they love me just like they love Chief Malik
Ask the foes they love me just like Lo or Walter Wheat
Yeah, I hit the push start on that foreign hoppin' the road through the trenches
Did 10 in a row in a prison, they shouldn't 've opened the fences
You all on social like he will vouch until we exposed and hit you
Look like he gon' blow and go on and pitch but nigga we know you some bitches
Nigga hit up your man you ain't gon' do shit, Truth is
I can do what they do, but they can't do this, True shit
I fill in the light that bitch was too lit, too lit
If ain't the realest to do it my nigga, then who is? You is
Yeah, on foenem, solid foenem
I blew a bag on that bitch to drive it, I'm puttin mileage on it
Let's throw a real nigga party, I got at least a hundred thousand on it
Check a bag, then I'm off to the jeweler, walk out a cooler
