Take off the tags
Don't trip on the cost
They feelin the swag
I'm drippin in sauce
I had my way with it
And I need another run
We done cop rollies on rollies on rollies and I need another one

I do not trust you
Don't fuck with no new niggas
Only my brothers
I might just hop from out of this whip and jump in yo bitch

All them niggas know is shoot em up
All them niggas know is blow ya down
