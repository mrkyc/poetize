I'ma G that's upper case
You see me in it that bitch up to date
You ain't in it you just in the fucking way
Fell in love with Ks
Fell in love with cake
Got em both with me, that's a double date
Out here busting plays
Your lil bitch calling
When I'm finished she gon let me fuck her face
I just ate I need another plate
Shorty runnin like you in the fucking race
Sucker almost made me catch another case
But that's a conversation for another day
I put on for my city, baby
But I'm feeling unappreciated lately
Been ??? that chopstick
First rapper holling that opp shit
Remember that way before shit was trending
On the Internet I had it popping
The rappers coming to the city had to get with me
Or I was gon rob em
Mobbin, 30 poppers, goons and goblins
I been a problem, been on that squad shit
They knew I was silent
But I ran through them projects
Like they was my shit

Come and get your bitch
Creepin on the money
Money stuffed all in the mattress
Out in Hollywood hills
Finna fall off in a actress
I don't go in there
Unless I bring pole in there
I keep that ratchet
And we definitely steppin out tonight
It's about to be classic
