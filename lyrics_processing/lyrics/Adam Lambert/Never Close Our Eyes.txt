I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way, we'd never close our eyes
Our eyes, never

I don't wanna let a minute get away (Mm)
'Cause we got no time to lose (To lose)
None of us are promised to see tomorrow
And what we do is ours to choose

Forget about the sunrise, fight the sleep in your eyes
I don't wanna miss a second with you
Let's stay this way forever
It's only getting better if we want it to

You know that I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way, we'd never close our eyes
Our eyes, never
You might also like
It's so hard to think this could fade away (Mm)
But what goes up must come down (Down, mm)
Why can't we just live life with no consequence
And always live in the now?

Forget about the sunrise, fight the sleep in your eyes
I don't wanna miss a second with you
Let's stay this way forever
It's only getting better if we want it to

You know that I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way, we'd never close our eyes
Our eyes, never

Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah (Yeah)

You know that I wish that this night would never be over
There's plenty of time to sleep when we die
So let's just stay awake until we grow older
If I had my way, we'd never close our eyes
