You're probably wondering what you're doing here
I bet you're dying to know
Oops, bad choice of words
Who's this stylish lad with the fresh toga gear?
Let me explain before the show, eyes on me
I am ruler of these masses
Like my daddy and my daddy's daddy before that, daddy
Their protection from trespassers (That's you big guy)
Invented a game, it keeps 'em tame
That's how I stay on top

I give the people what they want
And what they want's a little shocking
The bigger the beast, the messier the feast
But much to their delight
I give the people what they want
And what they want's a fight, haha

Haha, that's my, my evil laugh
Fight, fight, fight, fight
What we want's a fight
Did it scare you?
Fight, fight, fight, fight
It's what we want
Fight, fight, fight, fight
We want a fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
You might also like
You see the way the screaming hordes demand it
This spectacle says, "I've got your back," I'm the savior
I lied and said I caught you all red-handed
Doing something very bad
I then shelter them from evil
Like my daddy and my daddy's daddy, they think I'm the best
Nothing here is even illegal
They're entertained, no one complains
And it keeps me in St. Laurent

I give the people what they want
And what they want is to feel safe here
The world is small within our walls, outside is a risk
I give the people what they want
And what they want is this
I give the people what they want
I give the people what they want
I keep my crown, I make daddy proud, as long as I provide
I give the people what they want
And they want you to die
