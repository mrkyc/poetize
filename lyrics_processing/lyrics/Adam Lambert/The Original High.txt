I got the need for speedin' on a hot night
Pushin' a hundred and fifty just to get a rise
There's no comfort in comfort, I need the edge
But the edge keeps driftin', it's all in my head

Ooh, remember back in Hollywood
The medication flowing through my veins was you
Yeah, the summer back in Hollywood
The medication, medication

Just let me feel the rush like the first night
Wanna breathe it out 'cause I'm goin' out my mind
Gotta feel the touch like the first time
'Cause I'm chasing the original high
Chasing the original high
Chasing the original high
Chasing the original high
Chasing the original high

I'm tryna buy a fix, but there ain't no price
I try to feed the hunger that keeps me up at night
We were on a trip tryna replicate
But the highs I hit just ain't doin' it for me
You might also like
Ooh, remember back in Hollywood
The medication flowing through my veins was you
Yeah, the summer back in Hollywood
The medication, medication

Just let me feel the rush like the first night
Wanna breathe it out 'cause I'm going out my mind
Gotta feel the touch like the first time
'Cause I'm chasing the original high
Chasing the original high
Chasing the original high
Chasing the original high (Yeah)

Oh, summertime, it stays on my mind
'Cause you and me are alive inside
Summertime is stuck on my mind, oh
Oh, summertime, it stays on my mind
'Cause you and me never die inside
Summertime is stuck on my mind
(Oh yeah)
Chasing the original high
High
High
High
High
So high (Yeah)
Just let me feel the rush like the first night (So high)
Wanna breathe it out 'cause I'm going out my mind
Gotta feel the touch like the first time (Yeah)
'Cause I'm chasing the original high
Chasing the original high (I'm chasing it)
Chasing the original high (Oh, yeah)
Chasing the original high
