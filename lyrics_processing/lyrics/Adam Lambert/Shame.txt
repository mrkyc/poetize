Think, by now I would have learned just how you love to hurt me
Before I get a chance to speak, you're convinced I'm guilty

God knows I've been a very bad boy
You've been telling me
You've been telling me
But God knows I didn't break your toys
But you're blaming me
You're blaming me

I feel thrown out the window
You seem to enjoy
You don't have to be so
So hard on your boy
You don't have to be so (You don't have to be so)
So search and destroy (Search and destroy)
I feel thrown out the window
You're too hard on your boy
You're too hard on your boy

Now I don't mind a little pain when I've really earned it, yeah
But you got me whipped and chained when I don't deserve it

God knows I've been a very bad boy
You've been telling me
You've been telling me
But God knows I didn't break your toys but
You're blaming me
You're blaming me

I feel thrown out the window
You seem to enjoy
You don't have to be so
So hard on your boy
You don't have to be so (You don't have to be so)
So search and destroy (Search and destroy)
I feel thrown out the window (I feel so thrown out the window)
You're too hard on your boy
You're too hard on your boy
