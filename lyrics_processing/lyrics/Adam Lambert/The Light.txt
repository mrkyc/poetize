I'm the rush of a bleeding heart
I'm the bruise of a rough start
I'm the dust that ignites the spark
Oh, man, I was dark

They say that I'm blue like the night sky
That I'm too weird to live, too rare to die
I tried to blow my mind a million times
But I got a light

And it's burnin' still
And it's burnin' still
Yeah, it's burnin' still
And it's burnin'
I am the light
I am the light
The light, the light, the light, the light

I am the fire
And you are the rain
Washin' me out
You drown my flame
I am the fire
And you are the rain
Washin' me out
I am the fire
And you are the rain
Washin' me out
You drown my flame
I am the fire
And you are the rain
Washin' me out

I'm a prisoner on the run (I'm a prisoner on the run)
I am the moon that reflects the sun (I am the moon that reflects the sun)
I am unbeaten and I am unwon (I am unbeaten and I am unwon)
Oh, man, I was alone

They say that I'm new, that I'm evergreen
That I will rage against the machine
I am never something in between
But I got a light

And it's burnin' still
And it's burnin' still
Yeah, it's burnin' still
And it's burnin'
I am the light
I am the light
The light, the light, the light, the light....

I am the fire
And you are the rain
Washin' me out
You drown my flame
I am the fire
And you are the rain
Washin' me out
I am the fire
And you are the rain
Washin' me out
You drown my flame
I am the fire
And you are the rain
Washin' me out
I am the fire
I am the light
