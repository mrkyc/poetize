Where have all the good men gone and where are all the gods?
Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the risin' odds?
Isn't there the right knight upon a fiery steed?
Late at night, I toss and I turn and I dream of what I need

I need a hero
I'm holdin' out for a hero 'til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast
And he's got to be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holdin' out for a hero 'til the mornin' light
He's gotta be sure and he's gotta be soon
And he's got to be larger than life
Larger than life

Somewhere after midnight in my wildest fantasy
Somewhere just beyond my reach, there's someone reachin' back for me
Racin' on the thunder and risin' with the heat
It's gonna take a Superman to sweep me off my feet, yeah

I need a hero
I'm holdin' out for a hero 'til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast
And he's got to be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holdin' out for a hero 'til the mornin' light
He's gotta be sure and he's gotta be soon
And he's got to be larger than life
Larger than life

Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
Out where the lightnin' splits the sea
I could swear there was someone somewhere watchin' me
Through the wind and the chill and the rain
And the storm and the flood
I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood

I need a hero
I'm holdin' out for a hero 'til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast
And he's got to be fresh from the fight (I need)
I need a hero (Yeah)
I'm holdin' out for a hero 'til the mornin' light
He's gotta be sure and he's gotta be soon
And he's got to be larger than life
I need a hero
I'm holdin' out for a hero 'til the end of the night (I'm holdin' out)
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast
And he's got to be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holdin' out for a hero 'til the mornin' light (Yeah, yeah)
He's gotta be sure and he's gotta be soon
And he's got to be larger than life
