I only trust my tarot cards
Pink flamingos in my yard
People think that I'm from Mars
Whatever
Only smoke that holy green
High above the big machine
Not attached to anything
Whatever

I got that magic you call ADD
Rep for them aliens different like me

If you think that what I do and how I live's too much
I don't really really give two fux
If you think that what I say and what I give ain't love
I don't really really give two fux
Here, right here, right here
Namaste right here, right here, right here
Ooh ooh ooh

I'm the center of a crowded room
I might as well be on the moon (Yeah, yeah)
Searching for that one or two
Who get it (Oh, yeah)
You see me talking to myself
Cause no one gets me like myself
I've been this way since I was twelve
I get it
You might also like
I got that magic you call OCD
Rep for them aliens different like me

If you think that what I do and how I live's too much
I don't really really give two fux
If you think that what I say and what I give ain't love
I don't really really give two fux
Here, right here, right here
Namaste right here, right here, right here
Ooh ooh ooh


One shot for my enemies
In the end it ain't that deep (It ain't that deep, girl)
Imma get my inner peace
In leather (Ow!)

If you think that what I do and how I live's too much (How I live)
I don't really really give two fux (I don't give two fux)
If you think that what I say and what I give ain't love (I don't give, I don't give, I don't give, oh yeah)
I don't really really give two fux (I don't give two fux, oh oh oh oh)
Here, right here, right here
Namaste right here, right here, right here (I don't give, I don't give, I don't give two fux)
Ooh ooh ooh
Here, right here, right here
Namaste right here, right here, right here
