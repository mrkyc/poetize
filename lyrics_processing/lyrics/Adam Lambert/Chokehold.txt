Starin' at the ceiling in the dark
Sheets are in a knot
My heart is like a rock, aye
Pictures flashin' by inside my head
I'm hanging by a thread
But I'd do it all again, aye

I keep running away, running away, running away from you
But I can't stand breaking the chains, breaking the chains, breaking the chains
It's too good

'Cause I know the second you go
Want you to bring it on back, bring it on back, bring it on back to me
And you know
I want your chokehold
Want you to bring it on back, bring it on back, bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me

All without your touch, I suffocate
I could asphyxiate
But I kind of like the pain, hey
Baby, I can smell you on my clothes
I try to stay composed
But I feel the fever grow, grow oh oh
You might also like
I keep running away, running away. running away from you
But I can't stand breaking the chains, breaking the chains, breaking the chains
It's too good

'Cause I know the second you go
Want you to bring it on back, bring it on back, bring it on back to me
And you know
I want your chokehold
Want you to bring it on back, bring it on back, bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, hey, yeah
Me, me, me, me
Yeah, yeah
Gonna bring it back hey
Back to me

'Cause I know the second you go
Want you to bring it on back, bring it on back, bring it on back to me
And you know
I want your chokehold
Want you to bring it on back, bring it on back, bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Yeah, yeah
Oh, you gotta bring it right back
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
