Maybe I got it wrong
How did I turn you off?
'Cause now you're out of my reach
Maybe I played too safe
How did I pull away?
Am I too blinded to see?

I've been hoping you'd catch up somehow
Like I'm way too far ahead
Every time I think I'm gaining ground
I'm misunderstood again

I thought that I said it
In the things that I didn't say
I thought that you felt it
In the games that I didn't play
So let the record show I never let you go
Can we get back on track?
Oh, I thought that I said it
In the things that I didn't say
In the things that I didn't say
In the things that I didn't say
You might also like
What if I shout it out?
What if I take a vow?
Wouldn't you think it's too much?
What ya want from me?
Thought it was going deep
Guess it was never enough

I've been hoping you'd catch up somehow
Like I'm way too far ahead
Every time I think I'm gaining ground
I'm misunderstood again

I thought that I said it
In the things that I didn't say
I thought that you felt it
In the games that I didn't play
So let the record show I never let you go
Can we get back on track?
Oh, I thought that I said it
In the things that I didn't say
In the things that I didn't say
In the things that I didn't say
I thought I told you
I thought I told you
I thought I told you

I thought that I said it
In the things that I didn't say
I thought that you felt it
In the games that I didn't play
So let the record show I never let you go
Can we get back on track?
Oh, I thought that I said it
In the things that I didn't say
In the things that I didn't say
