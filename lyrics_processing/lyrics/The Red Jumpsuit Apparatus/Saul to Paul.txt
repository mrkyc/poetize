For all the times you told me not to jump 'cause I might fall
I said 'Thank you, thank you'
But I'm the kind of guy that has to fall to learn to fly
Still, I say 'Thank you, thank you.'

For all the times I looked into your eyes and said 'You lie'
Oh, I'm sorry
For all the times I looked into the sky and said I hated you
I'm sorry, God forgive me

Oh, Lord please help me change from Saul to Paul before it's too late (Before it's too late)
Oh Lord, I need to see that I can still be useful
That I can still serve thee
That I can still serve thee

For all the times you told me not to scream 'cause I might bleed
I said 'Thank you, thank you'
But I'm the kind of guy that has to scream to learn to sing
Still, I say 'Thank you, thank you'

For all the times I looked into the sky and said I hated you
I'm sorry
For all the times I looked into your eyes and said 'You lie'
Oh, I'm sorry, God forgive me (God, forgive me)
You might also like
Oh Lord, please help me change from Saul to Paul before it's too late (Before it's too late)
Oh Lord, I need to see that I can still be useful
That I can still serve thee
That I can still serve thee

I built my house on sand
I had to crawl to land to stand
And still, you loved me
I blamed it all on you
I was just hiding from the truth
And still, you loved me
And still, you loved me
And still, you loved me
And still, you loved me
And still, you loved me
And still, you loved me
And still, you loved me
And still, you loved me
And still, you loved me
And still, you loved me
And still, you loved me
