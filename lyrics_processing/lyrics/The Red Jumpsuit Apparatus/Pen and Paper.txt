This whole routine is getting old
So am I
And so are you
My reputation lets me know
I can do whatever I want to
Though it seems that you believe
You can do whatever it is you please
Not before, not before you wind up on your knees

Don't cry to me no more

You like the way the people stare at you
Now you look so fake
Just thought that you should know
And you're all the same
And when the curtain drops down
You'll be replaced by something typical

You set yourself up to be sold
And that's okay 'cause that's your role
Manipulation takes its toll
What will you do when nobody wants you
Though it seems that you believe
You can do whatever it is you please
Not before, not before you wind up on your knees
You might also like
Don't cry to me no more

You like the way the people stare at you
And now you look so fake
Just thought that you should know
And you're all the same
And when the curtain drops down
You'll be replaced by something typical

I know I stood so long beside you
And I know I should have left you right where I had found you
I know I stood so long beside you
And I know I should have left you right where I had found you

You like the way that people stare at you
Now you look so fake
Just thought that you should know
You're all the same
And when the curtain drops down
You'll be replaced by something typical
You like the way that people stare at you
Now you look so fake
Just thought that you should know
And you're all the same
And when the curtain drops down
