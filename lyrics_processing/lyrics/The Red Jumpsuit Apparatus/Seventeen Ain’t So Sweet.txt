Stayed one step above the rest
And even though it seemed
Like the world was crashing on her
Didn't let it hold her down
Didn't hold her back
Oh no....whoa....
Don't worry you'll show them
There's a fire in your eyes
And I hope you'll let it burn
There's a scream in your voice
And I hope you will be heard
There's a fire in your eyes
And I hope you'll let it burn until you're heard
You're heard
Seventeen is just a test, yeah, and i would recommend
That you live with no regrets
And even if it seems
Like the world was crashing on you
You shouldn't let it hold you down
Shouldn't hold you back
Oh no....whoa....
Don't worry you'll show them
There's a fire in your eyes
And I hope you'll let it burn
There's a scream in your voice
And I hope you will be heard
There's a fire in your eyes
And I hope you'll let it burn until you're heard
You're heard

Turn down the lights
No one can see you shining

It'll be alright
No one can stop you if you try
Point of rhythm is to fall away in time
To listen to the beating in your mind
And if you will seek then you shall find
Whoa....
There's a fire in your eyes
And I hope you'll let it burn

And I hope you will be heard

And I hope you'll let it burn until you're heard
You're heard
There's a fire in your eyes
And I hope you'll let it burn
There's a scream in your voice
And I hope you will be heard
There's a fire in your eyes
And I hope you'll let it burn until you're heard
