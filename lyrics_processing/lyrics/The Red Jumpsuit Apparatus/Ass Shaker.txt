Go!

I remember a year ago I was standing in the crowd
Waiting for my chance to break through, my chance to live again
Now it seems I've found some friends who finally understand what it takes
To make this dream come true, we'll be here till the end

Shake it, break it, get off your feet
Come dance with me and don't you fake it
Shake it, break it get off your feet
Get close to me and don't you fake it

Shout and scream, my friends, connect with me and we'll pretend
This night will never end (wo oh) this night will never end
Just let go you'll see together we'll do anything
This night will never end wo oh this night will never end

Shake it, break it, get off your feet!
Come dance with me and don't you fake it
Shake it, break it get off your feet!
Get close to me and don't you fake it
You might also like
Oh, wish I could thank you all for what you have done
And all of the things that you have shared with me
Oh, wish I could take you all too where I must go wish I could take you all
I'll take you with my heart

Get on the floor! (Dance!)
Get on the floor! (Shake!)
Get on the floor! (Break!)
Get on the floor! (Dance!)
Get on the floor! (Shake!)
Get on the floor! (Break!)

Shake it, break it, get off your feet!
Come dance with me and don't you fake it
Shake it, break it get off your feet!
Get close to me and don't you fake it

I'm reaching out here to show you what we've been through
I think there's something we can share, that's completely new
Or maybe I'm just insane, whoa!
