I remember a year ago, I was standing in the crowd
Waiting for my chance to break through
My chance to live again
And now it seems I've found some friends who finally understand
What it takes to make this dream come true
We'll be here 'til the end

Shake it, break it, get off your feet
Come dance with me and don't you fake it
Shake it, break it, get off your feet
Get close to me and don't you fake it

Shout (Hey) and (Hey) scream (Hey), my friends (Hey)
Connect (Hey) with me (Hey) and we'll pretend
This night will never end (Whoa-oh), this night will never end
Just (Hey) let (Hey) go (Hey), you'll see (Hey)
Together (Hey), we'll do (Hey) anything
This night will never end (Whoa-oh), this night will never end

Shake it, break it, get off your feet
Come dance with me and don't you fake it
Shake it, break it, get off your feet
Get close to me and don't you fake it
You might also like
Whoa, wish I could break you all
For what you have done
And all of the things that you have shared with me
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-ah, wish I could take you all
To where I must go, whoa-oh
Wish I could take you all, I'll take you in my arms
Get on the floor, get on the floor (Down), get on the floor (Down)
Get (Break) on the floor (Me), get on the floor (Down)

Shake it, break it, get off your feet
Come dance with me and don't you fake it
Shake it, break it, get off your feet
Get close to me and don't you fake it

I'm reaching out here to show you what we've been through
I think there's something we can share, that's completely new
Or maybe I'm just insane, whoa-oh
