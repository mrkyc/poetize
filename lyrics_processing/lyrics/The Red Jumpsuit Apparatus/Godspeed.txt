It's January 1970
Do you remember me?
You put me on a boat across the sea
In the name of victory
But much to my surprise when I arrived
There was no welcoming committee
Instead there was a man for me to kill
And now I see how this is all too real

Then I saw him standing with a bayonet
And as I ran towards him he hardly broke a sweat
When I took his life he fell to his knees
And as his eyes began to fade
He whispered softly

Godspeed this letter
Away from here
I've sealed it with my tears
And stamped it with my fears
And Godspeed this letter
Away from you
My work done here is through
I'm on my way to better days
And so are you
You might also like
And in his pocket there
I saw a picture of his children and his family
And I began to realize
This person I despised
In actuality
Was not much different from myself
We probably could have taught each other many things
And now I know it's much too late although I couldn't hesitate
I check his gun and his chamber was empty

Then I saw him standing with a bayonet
And as I ran towards him he hardly broke a sweat
When I took his life he fell to his knees
And as his eyes began to fade
He whispered softly

Godspeed this letter
Away from here
I've sealed it with my tears
And stamped it with my fears
And Godspeed this letter
Away from you
My work done here is through
I'm on my way to better days
And so are you
Oh, we know not what we've done
And oh, we know not what we've done

Godspeed this letter
Away from here
I've sealed it with my tears
And stamped it with my fears
And Godspeed this letter
Away from you
My work done here is through
I'm on my way to better days
