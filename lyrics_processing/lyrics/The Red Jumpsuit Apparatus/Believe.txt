Our decent times
It's gotten bad, and it's been
Pressin' on my mind
Got me feelin' sad

But I know you know
That we could do more
But we just don't

Don't worry, world
I feel your pain, and it's a shame
My shoulders are hurt
And stressed from the pain
And I know you know
That you could do more
But you

And I still believe
That there is more love than hate
There's more heart than ache
And we are stuck in this great big world together
You might also like
With a little bit of help from up above
And a sprinkling of love
We can break these chains
We will end these days

And I know you know
That you could do more
But you

And I still believe
That there is more love than hate
There's more heart than ache
And we are stuck in this great big world together
And I still believe
That there is a lot at stake, there's no time to wait
We can change the world if we try
We're gonna change it forever

You should join us
You should join us
You should join us
You, let it be you
Who will join us?
Who will join us?
Who will join us?
You, let it be you
And I still believe
That there is more love than hate
There's more heart than ache
And we are stuck in this great big world together
And I still believe
That there is a lot at stake
And there's no time to wait
We can change the world if we try
We're gonna change it forever
And I still believe
That there is more love than hate
There's more heart than ache
And we are stuck in this great big world together
