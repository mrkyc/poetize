Please aim slow
I know it's not like you
To take the fall
For anyone but yourself

Let me show you a world that you've never seen
Let me help you unveil what you've been missing
There is no time to wait
When you find love, you can't hesitate

Step right up, shoot an arrow at the target
My heart is an easy thing for you to hit
Don't worry, if you miss, I'll let you shoot again
My heart is an easy thing for you to win

Woah, you know you did it again-ain
And every time I hear your voice
Well, you know I have no choice but to let you in
Life is short, don't pretend

Let me show you a world that you've never seen
Let me help you unveil what you've been missing
There is no time to wait
When you find love, you can't hesitate

Step right up, shoot an arrow at the target
My heart is an easy thing for you to hit
Don't worry, if you miss, I'll let you shoot again
My heart is an easy thing for you to win
Step right up, shoot an arrow at the target
My heart is an easy thing for you to hit
Don't worry, if you miss, I'll let you shoot again
My heart is an easy thing for you to win

Please aim slow
Please aim slow
Ooh, what could I say to you (Please aim slow)
To let you know every day I am grateful? (Please aim slow)
I wish I could turn back time or make it rewind (Please aim slow)
I would find you when we were younger
So we could spend our good time on Earth together longer

Step right up, shoot an arrow at the target
My heart is an easy thing for you to hit
Don't worry, if you miss, I'll let you shoot again
My heart is an easy thing for you to win

Woah, step right up again
When you find love, you can't hesitate
Woah, step right up again
My heart is aching, I can barely wait
Woah, step right up again
When you find love, you can't hesitate
Woah, step right up again
