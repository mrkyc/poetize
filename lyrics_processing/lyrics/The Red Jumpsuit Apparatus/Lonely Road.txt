My grandpa said to me, "Grandson, sit down, we need to talk"
In life, there may be times when it gets hard to walk the walk
It's easier to take the path that most have traveled on
But then again, sometimes to do what's right, you must walk alone

And that is a lonely road, oh
When this world burns down deep in your soul, oh
You will find there's a peace left in mind
You will find there's a peace to find
Peace to find

Some people are unkind to those who see things different
And we've all felt pain in ways it hurts to even bring it up
But that don't mean that we should take this motion lying down
I'll stand and fight until the day they put me in the ground

And that is a lonely road, oh
When this world burns down deep in your soul
You will find there's a peace left in mind
You will find there's a peace to find

And now I've taught you all I know
So take this seed and let it grow
(So take this seed and let it grow)
So take this seed and let it grow
Though I'm here now, soon, I'll be gone
I did what I can to try and make you strong
(I did what I can to try and make you strong)
And they sing out your song
You might also like
And that is a lonely road, oh
When this world burns down deep in your soul (When this world burns down deep in your soul)
You will find there's a peace left in mind
You will find there's a peace to find
And that is a lonely road (Such a lonely road)
And that is a lonely road (Hey, hey, hey, it's a lonely road)
And that is a lonely road
