Suicide
Don't give a fuck about this
My life or any other
Just go away and let me hang
Impossible to forgive, forget it, murderer
I'm in control
Living a lie
Make you pay at all cost for this
Love sick
Bullshit
Bring it
Decisions making themselves
I don't need you
Thorns in my side
So I die

No one
No one could ever understand
My life's exhausted
No one
No one could ever understand
This life IMN

Determined
To bring you all down with me
Break you
Beat down
No more fucking empathy
From me, for you
Fed up
I've had enough
Duality
My war
Existence
Instigated controversy
Lay down
Sell out
So wrong
Drag the blade and go away
I stand, cold, cruel and lost
Take me I'm ready

No one could ever understand
My life's exhausted
No one
No one could ever understand
Pressure constricting
So hard
Like a stone
Fight hard
Break bones break
No one
No one could ever understand
This life IMN

Your pressure
My time
Eroding
My life
Fight for your honesty
Fight for integrity
All work and no play
All work and no play
All work and no play makes me
All work and no play
All work and no play makes me
Sick!
I want to eat a bullet
Carve myself
Beat my face
Catatonic
Dig my brain
No pain! suffocate!
Stomach aches
Don't give a fuck
I'm out, I'm done
Fuck this shit
You've dug the hole
I'm lying in
No one could ever understand
No one could ever understand
Fight for your honesty
Fight for integrity

No one
No one could ever understand
My life's exhausted
No one
No one could ever understand
Pressure constricting
So hard
Like a stone
Fight hard
Break bones break
No one
No one could ever understand
