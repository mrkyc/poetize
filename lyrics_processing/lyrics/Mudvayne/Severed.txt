And we hide behind
Lies, anger, hate they shoo love away
Shells of ourselves outside
Shelters body from culprits of reality

Come on
Step out!
Of your rind
Assemble strength
Focus

Release and run to me you can never look back to the visions from the past
They fade and wilt in time
You've got to just trust me to hold your hand through
Then I'll turn and walk away

Eclipse you all (Play you! Cut you away!)
(Bleed you! Strip you!) of your states of ain soph aur
Eclipse you all (Play you! Cut you away!)
(Spit up on my plate! Push everything away from me!)

And we sever all ties
It creates disruption midst circle of friends
I become sacrifice
Spare your life and leave me to my misery

Get off the cross!
And save yourself
Run away!
You'll be okay!

Run now, get away from me (Run away!)
If I can get my grip, I'll pull you (Don't look back! Don't ask for help!)
Down into the hell I call my head (Intimidate!)
You'll never get away
Sit down in my ugly place (Off the cross!)
And build walls out of fragments (And save yourself!)
From my past of all the people (Don't get sore!)
That I needed and loved that walked away (Get over me!)

You've got to just trust me to hold your hand through
Then I turn and walk away

I walk under clouds of gray
Sphere of storms in my head
I'm trapped again in endless rain

I divorce the thoughts of you in love with me
I divorce your innocence and my guilt
I divorce the lying sellout confidence
I'm divorcing every motherfuckin' thing
I divorce the love bled meaningless
I divorce the makeshift harmony
I divorce the taunting acts of violence
I divorce the pastime of jealousy
I divorce control
I divorce the faith
I divorce the virtue
I divorce the rain
I divorce the excuse
I divorce the greed
I divorce the need
I divorce iniquity in this motherfuckin' bullshit life
Just want it all to go away
Just want to run away to die
Take it
Myself
My life
Textbook fucking mental
Off me and pitch me in a hole
In this motherfuckin' bullshit life
In this fuckin' bullshit life

I'll always be your shadow
And veil your eyes from states of ain soph aur
I can't be the hero anymore
I spit up on my plate and then I turn and walk away
I spit up on my plate and I disrupt the family
I spit up on my plate as I sever the entity
And I feel your warm sun on my face
Separate
Separate
Separate
Separate!
(Play you! Cut you away!)
(Bleed you! Strip you!) of your states of ain soph aur
Eclipse you all (Play you! Cut you away!)
(Spit up on my plate! Push everything away from me!)
Eclipse you all (Play you! Cut you away!)
(Bleed you! Strip you!) of your states of ain soph aur
I need you (Play you! Cut you away!)
(It's always been this way! Push everything away from me!)
Eclipse you all (Play you! Cut you away!)
(Bleed you! Strip you!) of your states of ain soph aur
Eclipse you all (Play you! Cut you away!)
