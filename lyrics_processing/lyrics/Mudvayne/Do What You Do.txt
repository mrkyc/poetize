Lips bleed from the rings
All these little bruises, the little things
That promote the segregation
Lead to separation
Cage and clip the wings
Little noises, the little screams
That start the operation
Conscious amputation

Just do what you do, what you do
What you did to me
Now I'm stuck in between a rock and nowhere
With nothing, with no one
Just do what you do, what you do
What you've done to me
Draw the chalk line around the scene, it's over
Now it's all over

Broken heart that's lost its beat
A little boy that softly weeps
Overwhelmed with emotion
Fuse burns to explosion
Lost the forest through the trees
Little whispers, the little dreams
That spark the recollection
Constant suffocation

Just do what you do, what you do
What you did to me
Now I'm stuck in between a rock and nowhere
With nothing, with no one
Just do what you do, what you do
What you've done to me
Draw the chalk line around the scene, it's over
Now it's all over

I can feel my life is changing (Changing)
I can feel my heart is jaded (Jaded)
Left the sticks, left the stones
Words don't hurt, mend the bones
I can feel my life is changing


Just do what you do, what you do
What you did to me
Now I'm stuck in between a rock and nowhere
With nothing, with no one
Just do what you do, what you do
What you've done to me
Draw the chalk line around the scene, it's over
Now it's all over
We'll erase the past and leave the pain
Cleanse the wounds and forget the name
Lost the will, ran far away
So it's all over
Spread the ash and fill the grave
Lost the time, I make my way
Do what you do and go away
