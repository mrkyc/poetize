Hunger inside me that's always rising
To quench is to kill
Lusting enemy, but you don't know me
Snatched against your will
To satisfy me, pick my victim
Stealth is me (Those poor little girls)
So charming, say all the right things
"Just come with me" ("Let's go for a ride")

Trust me, believe me
Don't be so deceiving
God help me, restrain me
From bloodlust and beatings

I just wanna play
I just wanna play
A new game

The hunter within me that's always searching
Thirst for the kill
Abducted, take away, cursed with the patience
Of a thousand men
Peel my eyes, lock on target
The covert man (You never had a chance)
Don't be alarmed, want some candy?
Just right over here (Now get inside)

Trust me, believe me
Don't be so deceiving
God help me, restrain me
From bloodlust and beatings

I just wanna play
I just wanna play
A new...
I just wanna play, I just wanna play
I just wanna play a game
A new game


You meant everything to me
But now your nightmare's come
Another broken doll to me
But now your nightmare's come
You meant everything to me
But now your nightmare's come
Another broken doll to me
But now your nightmare's come
Let's take a ride
Let's take a ride
Let's take a ride
Come with me... now!
