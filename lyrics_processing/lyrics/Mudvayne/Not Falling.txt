Always, known in, all my time
A little left of center now
Reflect as I realize
That all I need is to find the middle pillar path
To sit like the sun by a star in the sky and just be
Sinners, casting stones at me

I, I stand, not crawling
Not falling down
I, I bleed the demons
That drag me down

I, I stand, for nothing, not crawling, the center
Not falling down of calms within the eye
I, I'll bleed, for no one, the demons, but myself
That pull me down for me and no one else
Goodbye, sunshine, I've put it out again, sad
I'm over, personalities, conflicting
I don't need you, or anyone, but me
I'll just be, living my own life
I feel my glowing center grow, infecting
I feel alive
Shovel dirt over lime
Plant it in myself to sit like a seed
Under covers of earth and just be
Sinners, pointing fingers at me

I, I stand, for nothing, not crawling, by myself
Not falling down
I, I'll bleed, for no one, the demons, but myself
That drag me down

I, I stand, for nothing, not crawling, the center
Not falling down of calms within the eye
I, I'll bleed, for no one, the demons, but myself
That pull me down for me and no one else
Come play kill
Refuse my body, refuse my shadow
Stone cold will
Refuse to lead this, refuse to follow
Bitter pills
Refuse to feed this, refuse to swallow
I'm fueled godless
Come play, come play
Kill
Just be, just be, just be, just be, just be, just be

I, I stand, for nothing, not crawling, by myself
Not falling down
I, I'll bleed, for no one, the demons, but myself
That drag me down
I, I stand, for nothing, not crawling, the center
Not falling down of calms within the eye
I, I'll bleed, for no one, the demons, but myself
