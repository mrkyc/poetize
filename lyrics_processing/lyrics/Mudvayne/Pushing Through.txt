Rip the womb
Feeling so sorry, selfish and sore
Wish I wasn't born!
Piece by piece, I can carry it all
Strength to be driven!
So unforgiving, anything is possible
Like leaving you all
I'm turning my back on this killing so small!

Step by step, I will push you through this
(All of you, get away from me)
Eye for an eye, I'll push you through this: my law
Step by step, I will push you through this
(All of you, get away from me)
Tooth for a tooth, I'll push you through this, through you!

Salt the wound
Cut through a conscience I've failed to explore
The calm before the storm!
Speak your peace and prepare for the fall
Words have been chosen
Tainting the gift, lying truths, so incredible
So fuck you all
I'm turning my back on this killing so small!

Spread the word, the killing is over!
Spread the word, the killing is over!
Severed more than I am, more than I ever was
Blindside, threatened my worth, sequestered deliverance
You stole a part of me, you've taken a part of me

Try! You wanted to be, wanted to have a
Life! You wanted to fight, wanted the right
Lies! Spoken to me without a conscience: no right!
Why?! Breaking a mold, breaking the trust
Child! Innocence lost, ultimate cost
Loss! Life so undone, deserted the seed
You buried the bottle!

Step by step, I will push you through this
(All of you, get away from me)
Eye for an eye, I'll push you through this: my law
Step by step, I will push you through this

Tooth for a tooth, I'll push you through this, through you!
Step by step, I will push you through!
Eye for an eye, I'll push you through!
Tooth for a tooth, I'll push you through!
Push it through! Push it through!
Push it through! Push it through!
