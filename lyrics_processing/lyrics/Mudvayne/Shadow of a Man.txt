Mirror, mirror, upon the wall, I'm asking you:
"Who is the most confused of them all?"
Mirror, mirror, subservient twin screams back at me:
"You! You sick, flawless mime! I want to break you!"

(Yeah, you're a clever one)

Do you reflect me? Or do I reflect you?
Are you inside of another world? I want to break through

(Yeah, you're a clever one)

Is this a tool? (Is this a tool?)
Can I step through
To find another plane? (To find another plane?)
I'm just a shadow of a man
Superficial tool (Superficial tool)
To support the vanity
Of weak
When you don't love yourself

If life's as painful on your side
I'll break your existence and cut through mine

(Yeah, you're a clever one)

Are you a tool? (Are you a tool?)
Can I step through
To find another plane? (To find another plane?)
I'm just a shadow of a man
Are you my brother? (Are you my brother?)
You look like me
Trapped inside another world (Trapped inside)
My lost twin

Just a superficial tool (Just a superficial tool)
To support the vanity
Of weak
When you don't love yourself

Mirror upon the wall, am I a reflection of you?
Mirror upon the wall, are you staring back through?
Understanding has no place within my world
Until I say

Are you a tool? (Are you a tool?)
Can I step through
To find another plane? (To find another plane?)
I'm just a shadow of a man
Are you my brother? (Are you my brother?)
You look like me
Trapped inside another world (Trapped inside)
My lost twin

Are you a tool?
Can I step through
To find another plane?
I'm just a shadow of a man
Just a superficial tool
To support the vanity
Of weak
