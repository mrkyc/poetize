All work and no play

Live in a secret
Live in a lie
Live in a dark hole
Beneath the black sky
Live like a martyr
And draw my last breath
I feel like an old man
With a knife in my chest
Live like a transient
Live like a thief
Hide in your closet
Grinding my teeth
Sit in a small room
With the walls closing in
Open the shutters
But everything's still dim

I'm not the reason
It's not my fault
It's not my problem
I'm not the cause
I'm not your scapegoat
I'm not your god
I'm not your martyr
I'd leave you all
I'm not the reason
(I'm not your scapegoat)
It's not my fault
(I'm not your god)
It's not my problem
(I'm not your martyr)
I'm not the cause
(I'd leave you all)
Work and no play
Makes me a dull boy
I feel like a clown
Without my funny nose
I walk to the window
Break it out with my fist
Jump from the sill
And I plunge to my death
You call me selfish
Whatever you think
Throw back my pills
And take a sip of my drink
Walk beneath the clouds
Walk beneath the trees
Always a canopy
Covering me
