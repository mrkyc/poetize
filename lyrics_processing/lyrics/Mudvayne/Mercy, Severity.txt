We've come here from so far away
I can save you if you leave it all behind
This suffering's been far too long
Would you take a trip with me on the back of a star?

I feel like this gravity
Is just here to pull us down

(Mother of creation, wait)
Embrace the souls of a lost world
Carry them away
(Darkness, negative, receptive)
Pour firmament between our waters
Separate the space
(Mother of destruction, wait)
With a belt of skulls, strap me down
And send the ship away
(Progress with the process)
Mine the souls from their casts
Pour, form, and re-shape

This dark womb wraps and covets me
Redefining understanding if you open up the heart
Nurturing this phenomenon
We can carry you on our wings, our wings, through the dark

Lightning flashes of insight
Into the mirth of a dark sky
Pain of division is nothing
Joy of dissolution is everything

(Mother of creation, wait)
Embrace the souls of a lost world
Carry them away
(Darkness, negative, receptive)
Pour firmament between our waters
Separate the space
(Mother of destruction, wait)
With a belt of skulls, strap me down
And send the ship away
(Progress with the process)
Mine the souls from their casts
Pour, form, and re-shape

Portal sits deep within the eye
The eye of Yin's severity rewards understanding
Portal sits deep within the eye
The eye of Yin's severity rewards understanding
Blackness consumes
Body covets, core of nothing
Blackness consumes
Body covets, core of nothing
Mother, I can remember a vault of security
Would you take me away?
Would you take me away?
Won't you take me away? Away
(Mother of creation, wait)
Embrace the souls of a lost world
Carry them away
(Darkness, negative, receptive)
Pour firmament between our waters
Separate the space
(Mother of destruction, wait)
With a belt of skulls, strap me down
And send the ship away
(Progress with the process)
Mine the souls from their casts
