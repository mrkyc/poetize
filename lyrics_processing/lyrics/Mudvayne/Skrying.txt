Missing pieces growing eyes
Mystery
Little girls severity
Little boys begging mercy
Sticks break on me
Cost of life at 23
Price of pain a golden ring
All crimson
Melting body rubber world
Battle axe with locks of curls
Introverted
My cost, the price of a broken doll
Can you remember that place
The place you would go to make things okay
1000 points for insect stings
Glue my spirit, break my wings
Misery
Libido steams infectious whore
Cauterize and forge the sword
Remember killing
Children, learning the secret knock
A nickel to enter that place
The place you would go to make things okay
My cost, the price of a broken doll
Can you remember that place
The place you would go to take pain away

Cut his throat and slaughter meat
My secrets
Seven heads for seven seas
Darkened voices plead disease
Dismembering me
Children, wrestle to seal the bag
Storing it deep in that place
The place you would go and try to escape
Children, learning the secret knock
A nickel to enter that place
The place you would go to make things okay
My cost, the price of a broken doll
Can you remember that place
The place you would go to take pain away
Skrying through reflections in a pool
I see death coming, mowing down
Do you remember the bedroom
Was it your cell or was it your tomb
Skrying through reflections in a pool
I see death coming, mowing down
Do you remember the bedroom
Was it your cell or was it your tomb
You're living through my hell
You're living through my hell
Children, learning the secret knock
A nickel to enter that place
The place you would go to make things okay
My cost, the price of a broken doll
Can you remember that place
