Hold me back and hold me down
Hold me close, then push me around
Beat me up, beat me down to the ground
I'm sure I deserved it
Left my world, left me alone
Locked inside, head becomes my home
Inside a hole, buried like a bone
I'm sure you had your reasons

Out of your sight
Are you out of your mind?
In my absence, your heart
Never grew fonder

You just leave me alone
Tell me, please tell me it ain't so
I can't believe it, so I walk the road
You just left me alone
Tell me, please tell me it ain't so
Had to believe it, so I walk alone

So I walk alone
By myself

Had my back, then you turned around
Love by default but were never proud
(I'd) Run away, but I'm not allowed
So I suffer through it

Out of your sight
Are you out of your mind?
In my absence, your heart
Never grew fonder

You just leave me alone
Tell me, please tell me it ain't so
I can't believe it, so I walk the road
You just left me alone
Tell me, please tell me it ain't so
Had to believe it, so I walk alone
So I walk alone

Enough love for the family
Just nothing left for me, ya see?
It's just like Cinderella
Locked up and hid away
You have no idea
What you've created
Wanted to take a look
And see through a hole without a key
See where I've been missing
Goddamn you for what I am
Enough love for the family
Just nothing left for me, ya see?
It's just like Cinderella
Locked up and hid away
You have no idea
What you've created
Wanted to take a look
And see through a hole without a key
See what I've been missing
Goddamn you for what I'm missing

No one left for me

You just leave me alone
Tell me, please tell me it ain't so
I can't believe it, so I walk the road
You just left me alone
Tell me, please tell me it ain't so
Had to believe it, so I walk alone
So I walk alone

It's just like Cinderella
Locked up and hid away
You have no idea
It's just like Cinderella
Locked up and hid away
You have no idea
It's just like Cinderella
Locked up and hid away
You have no idea
It's just like Cinderella
Locked up and hid away
