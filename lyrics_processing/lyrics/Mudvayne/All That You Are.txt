Repeating in my head, betrayal
Repeating in my head, insecurities
Repeating in my head, diffidence
It's not your fault
The well of thought and trust has run dry
Don't be afraid to let go
Don't be afraid to start over when it's over
Let go, let go, let go, let go

Let go of feelings, let go of compromise
Hollow trunk for shelter, so dark and cold inside
I always seem to find myself alone
Jaded shell of being, porous as a stone

Calloused, rigid, empty, because of you

Let go of trusting, lost thought for family
Let go of living, no more concerns of demise
I never seem to find rhythm for life's harmony
Contorted, twisted, broken, without a reason

Calloused, rigid, empty, because of you

It's all me, all you are
Without me, there's nothing else, there's no one
Brainwash all you are
Without me, you're by yourself, there's no one

Hope is out of season
Lost sight, no hint of light
Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'

Calloused, rigid, empty, because of you

It's all me, all you are
Without me, there's nothing else, there's no one
Brainwash all you are
Without me, you're by yourself, there's no one

Save me this loss
Closure, my answer, so grant it
You owe me all that you are
Without me, you're nothing, you're no one
Terrified, petrified, nothing, you're no one
Do you care, because I don't
Nothing, you're no one
Nobody cares, so just go
Nothing, you're no one
By yourself all alone
It's all me, all you are
Without me there's nothing else, there's no one
Brainwash all you are
Without me, you're by yourself, there's no one

Save me this loss
Closure, my answer, so grant it
You owe me all that you are
