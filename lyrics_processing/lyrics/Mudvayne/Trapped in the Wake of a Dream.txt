Do I deserve these beatings? Hating me
Well, then cut, cut the noose and let me fall away
I'm growing weak and tired of you
And your little shoving games... Fucking pushing me

You pulled the trigger...
Trapped in the wake of your dream!

You're all killers! Always fucking pushing me
Insulting me... I've overcome...
I have found the strength of gods in me
Crushing all unwilling! This is so unstoppable
Hard as nails... Hook that holds...
Reach down and find the strength of many in you

My sanctuary calling my name
So I run through... to the light weeping through a cloud
Darkened by a tainted dream of me
Bein' pummeled by the tide... crushing, killing me

But I can't wake up...
Trapped in the wake of a dream!

Crushing all unwilling! This is so unstoppable
Hard as nails... Hook that holds...
Reach down and find the strength of many in you

I arise in the place of the gathered of waters, through the rolled back cloud of night, from the father of waters run forth through the spirit, 'round under  veils of darkness, there was a blood of  in the silence of death

Call it... Call a truce...
I believe it, in it more and more: Comfort
Purge the truth, I'll believe it...
I'm so weak and sore: Shadowed
Hide and seek, but you never looked
I wait behind the door...
Call out... Bite the hand that is feedin'
Compassion, no more!
I hope I never wake up!
Dream sewing filters, distort reality of what is mine
Through light, this mind awakens
I draw the line from then and now, awake and dreaming
Forgotten past, future becomes mine!
Throw the chains all away
Take control of your life
Powers known, this is my
Throw the chains all away

Crushing all unwilling! This is so unstoppable
Hard as nails... Hook that holds...
