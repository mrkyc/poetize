Manage me, I'm a mess
Turn a page, I'm a book half unread
I wanna be laughed at, laughed with, just because
I wanna feel weightless and that should be enough
But I'm stuck in this fucking rut
Waiting on a second-hand pick-me-up
And I'm over
Getting older

If I could just find the time
Then I would never let another day go by
I'm over
Getting old

Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of watching
While the minutes pass as I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here

Make believe that I impress
That every word by design turns a head
I wanna feel reckless, I wanna live it up, just because
I wanna feel weightless, 'cause that would be enough

If I could just find the time
Then I would never let another day go by
I'm over
Getting old

Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of watching
While the minutes pass as I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here

This could be all I've waited for
(I've waited, I've waited for)
And this could be everything
I don't wanna dream anymore
Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I've been going crazy
I'm stuck in here
Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of watching
While the minutes pass as I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
