I got your picture, I'm coming with you, Dear Maria, count me in
There's a story at the bottom of this bottle and I'm the pen

When the lights go off I want to watch the way you take the stage by storm
The way you wrap those boys around your finger
Go on and play the leader' cause you know it's what you're good at
The low road for the fast track, make every second last

'Cause I got your picture, I'm coming with you, Dear Maria, count me in
There's a story at the bottom of this bottle and I'm the pen
Make it count when I'm the one who's selling you out
'Cause it feels like stealing hearts, calling your name from the crowd

Live and let live, you'll be the showgirl of the home team
I'll be the narrator telling another tale of the American dream
I see your name in lights, we can make you a star
Girl, we'll take the world by storm, it isn't that hard

'Cause I got your picture, I'm coming with you, Dear Maria, count me in
There's a story at the bottom of this bottle and I'm the pen
Make it count when I'm the one who's selling you out
'Cause it feels like stealing hearts, calling your name from the crowd

Woah-oh-oh, haha
Take a breath, don't it sound so easy?
Never had a doubt, now I'm going crazy
Watching from the floor
Take a breath and let the rest come easy
Never settle down, 'cause the cash flow leaves me
Always wanting more

'Cause I got your picture, I'm coming with you, Dear Maria, count me in
There's a story at the bottom of this bottle and I'm the pen
Make it count when I'm the one who's selling you out
'Cause it feels like stealing hearts, calling your name from the crowd
