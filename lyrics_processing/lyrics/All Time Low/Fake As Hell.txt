I know it's better if we both say
"So long and thanks for the memories"
I'd like to say that it's been real
But it's been fake as hell

I caught you lyin' in my face again
You got me hangin' by a thread again
Feel like a kite in a hurricane
So cut the string and let me fly away

Now we're burnin' at both ends
Like candles in the wind
My eyelids collapsin'
Collateral damage

I know it's better if we both say
"So long and thanks for the memories"
I'd like to say that it's been real
But it's been fake as hell
Take two and call me in the mornin'
Three chances, should've seen the warnin'
For what it's worth, I wish you well
Yeah, it's been real, you're fake as hell

You're superficial, you know how to fake it
So artificial, don't know how to take it
You got a problem, I don't wanna solve it
Now it's official, I don't even miss ya

You say it's really nothin' personal
And everyone you love is just expendable
Can't make a friend without the end, you know
It's collateral damage

I know it's better if we both say
"So long and thanks for the memories"
I'd like to say that it's been real
But it's been fake as hell
Take two and call me in the mornin'
Three chances, should've seen the warnin'
For what it's worth, I wish you well
Yeah, it's been real, you're fake as hell

You say it's really nothin' personal
Everyone you love is just expendable
You say it's really nothin' personal (Can't make a friend without the end, you know)
Personal, personal (End, you know)
You say it's really nothing personal (I know it's better if we both say)
Everyone you love is just expendable ("So long and thanks for the memories")
Can't make a friend without the end, you know (I'd like to say that it's been real)
End, you know (But it's been fake as hell)
I know it's better if we both say
"So long and thanks for the memories" (Thanks for the memories)
I'd like to say that it's been real

Fake as hell
You're so fake as hell (For what it's worth, I wish you well)
