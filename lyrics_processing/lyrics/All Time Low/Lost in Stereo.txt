Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo

She works for the weekend, mix-tape of her favorite bands
Tearing up the radio, lost in the stereo's sound
She's trouble in a tank-top, pretty little time-bomb
Blowing up - take you down
Living in the radio, lost in the stereo's sound

She's dancing alone, I'm ready to go but she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's outta control, so beautiful
In stereo, lost in stereo
And I've been waiting for so long but she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo

Shake-down on a Saturday
Sit back, gotta catch my breath
'Cause every time I see her
Know she's gonna take it back somehow
Tattoos and a switch-blade attitude
Snakebite heart with a bubble-gum smile
Sex in stereo, don't turn the radio dial

She's dancing alone, I'm ready to go but she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's out of control, so beautiful
In stereo, lost in stereo
And I've been waiting for so long but she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo

And I'm just like cellophane
'Cause she sees right through me
I know she's glitter and gold
And that's just the price I pay
When I don't even know her name
She's slipping away

She works for the weekend, mix-tape of her favorite bands
Tearing up the radio, lost in the stereo's sound

She's dancing alone, I'm ready to go but she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's out of control, so beautiful
In stereo, lost in stereo
And I've been waiting for so long but she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's dancing alone, I'm ready to go but she's so
Lost in stereo, lost in stereo
She's out of control, so beautiful
In stereo, lost in stereo
And I've been waiting for so long but she'll never know
I'm losing hope 'cause she's so
