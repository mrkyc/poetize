What are you trying to fix me for?
Maybe I'm broken but I'm not sure
Am I depressed or am I just bored?
Apathy and irony, postmodern anxiety

Time to face up to the inevitable
I guess I might be losing it from staying at home
I dumb it down with Jeopardy! and late-night TV
(And I don't even like it)
Safe to say I know I'm not the only one
And I don't have time for all this time I'm wasting

What are you trying to fix me for?
Maybe I'm broken but I'm not sure
Am I depressed or am I just bored?
Apathy and irony, postmodern anxiety
Tell me you're okay, yeah, what's that like?
Rose-tinted glasses, it must be nice
Doing your best while you die inside
Apathy and irony, postmodern anxiety
(Apathy and irony, postmodern anxiety)

I don't mind the fireworks that keep me awake
(But they still kind of scare me)
I don't think the melatonin works at all
My money plant's dying and the dust is collecting
(And my therapist hates me)
It's Monday morning, sleeping through the wake up call

It's time to face up to the inevitable
(But I'm always sleeping)
I guess it feels good to know that I'm not alone
(All the world is sleeping)
