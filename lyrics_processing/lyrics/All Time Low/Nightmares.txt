There's a little house on a perfect little hill
Just short of a fairy tale
There's a little child with a million ways to feel
Caught up in a hurricane
Paper thin walls
Angry words from down the hall
Something changed them
I think about him every now and again

Now there's a ghost in the back of this room
And I don't like it
I fall asleep with my covers pulled up
And try to fight it
I gotta say it's hard to be brave
When you're alone in the dark
I told myself that I wouldn't be scared
But I'm still having nightmares
(I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake)
(I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake)
I'm still having nightmares
(I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm still having nightmares)

Every little thing got me coming back around
Digging up old memories
Always used to be the one to let it go
Kept my fears in a suitcase
I locked them away
In a place they wouldn't find
They still haunt me
I think about it every now and again

Now there's a ghost in the back of this room
And I don't like it
I fall asleep with my covers pulled up
And try to fight it
I gotta say it's hard to be brave
When you're alone in the dark
I told myself that I wouldn't be scared
But I'm still having nightmares
(I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake)
I'm still having nightmares
(I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm still having nightmares
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
