3 p.m., on my feet and staggering
Through misplaced words and a sinking feeling
I got carried away
Sick, sick of sleeping on the floor
Another night, another score
I'm jaded, bottles breaking

You're only happy when I'm wasted
I point my finger but I just can't place it
Feels like I'm falling in love
When I'm falling to the bathroom floor
I remember how you tasted
I've had you so many times, let's face it
Feels like I'm falling in love alone
Stella, would you take me home?
Stella, would you take me home?

2 a.m., I'm on a blackout binge again
You know I don't need sleep and I lost my keys
But I've got so many friends
And they keep, keep me coming back for more
Another night, another score
I'm faded, bottles breaking

You're only happy when I'm wasted
I point my finger but I just can't place it
Feels like I'm falling in love
When I'm falling to the bathroom floor
I remember how you tasted
I've had you so many times, let's face it
Feels like I'm falling in love alone
Stella, would you take me-

One more reason I should never have met you
Just another reason I could never forget you
Down we go, the room's spinning outta control
Lose myself in a chemical moment
Night life's taking its toll
That's just the way it goes, come on
Stella, would you take me home?

You're only happy when I'm wasted
I point my finger but I just can't place it
Feels like I'm falling in love alone
Stella, would you take me home?
You're only happy when I'm wasted
I point my finger but I just can't place it
Feels like I'm falling in love
When I'm falling to the bathroom floor
I remember how you tasted
I've had you so many times, let's face it
Feels like I'm falling in love alone
