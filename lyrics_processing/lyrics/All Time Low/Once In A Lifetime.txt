Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime

I wanna drink, wanna think, write a song about it
I wanna smoke, make a joke, try to hide the damage
I wanna drive this car right over the edge
Of every bad idea, I didn't have yet
I look at you, look at me, feeling kinda tragic
Dazed and confused, hard to see, where we lost the magic
I never meant to be hypocritical
This fucking crazy ride's left me cynical

And just like that, I know there's no turning back
We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it

Once in a lifetime, never the right time
Take it fast and kill me slow
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
'Til I hit an all-time low
Once in a lifetime, never the right time
To throw out everything we had
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
I hope a heart only breaks this bad
Once in a lifetime
See All Time Low LiveGet tickets as low as $66You might also like
I try to run, try to hide, just forget about it
I tell myself every night, I could live without it
I wanna say goodbye to the loneliness
But every time I do, I make another mess

And just like that, I know there's no looking back
We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it

Once in a lifetime, never the right time
Take it fast and kill me slow
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
'Til I hit an all-time low
Once in a lifetime, never the right time
To throw out everything we had
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
I hope a heart only breaks this bad

Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime

And just like that, I know there's no turning back
We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it
Once in a lifetime, never the right time
Take it fast and kill me slow
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
'Til I hit an all-time low
Once in a lifetime, never the right time
To throw out everything we had
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
I hope a heart only breaks this bad

Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime (I hope a heart only breaks this bad)
