Wait, I think we're on to something
We can't run from fate
But we can let it take us down
Down this road, where all our colours run together
Let's take the worst and make it better
Let's take this mess and make a home

I know it gets hard for you to stay
But do you really wanna throw it all away?
(I'm thinking)

That we could make forever after all
Finding the gold in our darkest moment
Watching the roads turning into white roses, roses
And we don't ever have to leave these walls
I'll be the boy with the silver lining
You'll be the girl with the cinderblock garden

Tonight, take all the ghosts and all those skeletons you hide
Bury them deep beneath the ground
Let them rest 'cause you weren't meant to bear that burden
Look at the roses in your garden
You can breathe now and forget

Forget it gets hard for you to stay
But we don't really have to throw it all away
(I'm thinking)

That we could make forever after all
Finding the gold in our darkest moment
Watching the roads turning into white roses, roses
And we don't ever have to leave these walls
I'll be the boy with the silver lining
You'll be the girl with the cinderblock garden
Just hold out for tomorrow
Our dreams will follow
Follow us back to when
When nothing was broken
The future was open
Let's go back again (Let's go again)

That we could make forever after all
Finding the gold in our darkest moment
Watching the roads turning into white roses, roses
And we don't ever have to leave these walls
I'll be the boy with the silver lining
You'll be the girl with the cinderblock garden
