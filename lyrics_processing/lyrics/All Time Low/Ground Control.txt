What do the books say about this one now?
I think we've lost it all
There's nothing to explain the distances any more
All systems are critical
Can't find my way back to you
Feels like there's nowhere to go-oh-oh
I'm just out here waiting for you to say

Don't be afraid, no
If you start floating away
Hey!
I promise you we'll be fine
Got the universe on your side when
You're out in space (you're out in space)
Don't you be afraid, (don't you be afraid) no
If you start floating away
Hey!
I promise you we'll be fine
Got the universe on your side when
You're out in space (you're out in space)
Don't you be afraid, (don't you be afraid) no
If you start floating away

I think I've lost my mind
There's nothing keeping me from going outside any more
My systems are critical
Gotta find my way back to you
Feels like I'm drifting alone, oh oh
I'm just out here wishing that you would say

Don't be afraid, no
If you start floating away
Hey!

Hey!
I promise you we'll be fine
Got the universe on your side when
You're out in space (out in space)
Don't you be afraid, (don't you be afraid) no
If you start floating away
We gotta make contact to make it out
We gotta make contact to make it
We gotta make contact to make it out

If you start floating away
Hey!
I promise you we'll be fine
Got the universe on your side when
You're out in space (you're out in space)
