I've fought it for a long time now
While drowning in a river of denial
I washed up, fixed up, picked up all my broken things
'Cause you left me; Police-tape, chalk-line
Tequila shots in the dark scene of the crime
Suburban living with a feeling that I'm giving up
Everything for you

Oh-oh-oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh-oh-over me?
I think that I should go (Go)
And something's telling me to leave but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I don't

It took a lot to take you home
One stupid call and I end up alone
You're made up, dressed up, messed up plans I set in stone
But you made me do when I don't, like
Dancing in the alley with the street-rat night-life
Can't keep living with a feeling that I'm giving up everything for you

Oh-oh-oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh-oh-over me?
I think that I should go (Go)
And something's telling me to leave but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I don't

Make a fool of myself when you hang around
When you're gone, I'm a match that's burning out
Could have been, should have done what I said I was going to do
(Said that I would do)
But I never promised you
(But I never promised you, promised you)

Oh-oh-oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh-oh-over me?
I think that I should go (Go)
It never took a fool to see the things that I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I do ya

Oh-oh-oh, how was I supposed to know
('Cause you left me, police tape, chalk line)
That you were oh-oh-over me, I think that I should go
(Tequila shots in the dark scene of the crime)
Something's telling me to leave but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I d-d-d
