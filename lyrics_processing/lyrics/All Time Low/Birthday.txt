I got a lot of things on my mind right now
A million ways to think about you
I can't say I expected anything different
'Cause the way you complicate me's simple, yeah

Ba da ba da ba, ba da ba da ba
She didn't stutter, my chest flutters
Cardiac attack in the cradle of the summer
Ba da ba da ba, ba da ba da ba
I'm superstitious, the kid's vicious
Bubblegum smile, taste the cherry on her lips

You know I want you in the worst way
I need you like cake on my birthday
The way you operate is so sweet
I need you like cake on my birthday
Ba da ba da ba, ba da ba da ba

I got a lot of long nights in my life right now
And a lot of spare time to waste with you
I can't say I expected something so visceral
But the way we complicate it's simple, oh yeah
