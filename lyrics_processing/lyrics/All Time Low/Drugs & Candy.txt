I can't take another hollow point conversation
It's getting hard to fake
The sound of you, an outlasting vibration
There's something I can't shake

The sweetness of you on my tongue
I breathed you in, you filled my lungs
A bitter taste, surrender waste
Another weakness

You and me are like drugs and candy (drugs and candy, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take one down for the young and easy (young and easy, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You get me out of my head
I fill this space in your bed
High on the beat of a breakdown (breakdown)
'Cause you and me are like drugs and candy (drugs and candy)
And I don't wanna give it up

You caught me in a moment of redemption
There's nothing to explain
You had me on the edge of indiscretion
You said you feel the same
