Should I write myself out of the history books
And mark a place in time for every chance you took?
Don't get me wrong
I know you've got your life in place
I've yet to take the hint, someday
I'm sure I'll get the picture
And stop waiting up

When it all comes down
To a sunrise on the East Side
Will you be there to carry me home
The remains of my wasted youth?
This wasted time on you
Has left me shaking in waiting
Shaking in waiting for something more

Tonight is alive with the promise of a street-fight
And there's money on the table
That says your cheap shots won't be able to break bones
I've yet to break a sweat
I'll make your past regret its future
Here's to you

Will you be there to carry me home
The remains of my wasted youth?
This wasted time on you
Has left me shaking in waiting for something more

Make all of my decisions for me
I've never taken the fall for deceit
We'll keep a secret if you keep me guessing
The taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like
Make all of my decisions for me
I've never taken the fall for deceit
We'll keep a secret if you keep me guessing
The taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like this

I can keep a secret if you can keep me guessing
The flavor of your lips is enough to keep me pressing
For more than just a moment of truth between the lies told
To pull ourselves away from the lives we leave back
(I can keep a secret if you can keep me guessing)
The flavor of your lips is enough to keep me here, keep me here
When it all comes down
To a sunrise on the East Side
Will you be there to carry me home
The remains of my wasted youth?
This wasted time on you
