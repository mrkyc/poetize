In the dark there's a light that's calling everyone out
If you could see beyond the walls that you have built
I know it's hard to escape the past and start it again
Those memories of all the future hearts you killed

I don't want to be the one that's left behind
Don't blame me, don't hate me
I don't want to be the one that's left behind

I won't fade away
Be forgotten, or just cast away, oh
'Cause this life is mine to live
I won't fade away
I am lost inside this endless haze of life
But this life is mine to live

Waking up just to catch yourself dreaming again
But you won't think outside the lines that hold you in
You say it's easier just to hide yourself away
To shut the windows, lock the door and disappear

I don't want to be the one that's left behind
Don't blame me, don't hate me
I don't want to be the one that's left behind
