On a fault line, late night
Underneath the stars, we came alive
And singing to the sky just felt right
I won't forget the good times
While the punks started picking fights
With the skater kids under city lights
Remember how we laughed 'til we cried
I won't forget the good times

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word and carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

We were bare-knuckled, tight lip
Middle fingers up, ego trip
Devil may care but we didn't mind
I won't forget the good times
We're the boys in black smoking cigarettes
Chasing girls who didn't know love yet
As the bonfire moon came down
I won't forget the good times

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word and carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

When we laughed, when we cried
Those were the days we owned the nights
Locked away, lost in time
I found the nerve to say that

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word and carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times (Won't forget the good times)
I won't forget the good times (Won't forget the good times, yeah)
I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word and carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
