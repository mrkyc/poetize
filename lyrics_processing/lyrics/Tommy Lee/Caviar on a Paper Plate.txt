I seen this little cutie at the  of the pub
Looking for a tutor that could teach her to fuck
I told her I could show her for a couple of bucks
Had her screaming like a demon on angel dust
I need another baby like a hole in the head
She instantly made me chain her to the poles on the bed
I always knew she crazy, by dinner she said
Anybody ever love me I'd die 
I went to see the old witch doctor
For a problem with my posture
Jabbing hoes like Jake LaMotta
Jammed in the back of the Mazda Miata
One for the money and two for the go
Three little piggies on street patrol
Four  and three 
Poor little rich girl sold her soul

I had a premonition I was rich 
My baby said I'm tripping so I flipped her the bird
Now  now my dick in the dirt
I wanna be a cowboy but don't understand
How to ride a pony only using one hand
I never met a woman that I couldn't offend
Take  send her back to her man
Got a visit from my lawyer
With my check from unemployment
Says my business in the toilet
Sick of being so exploited
One for the money and two for the fame
Three little hookers got taken away
Four politicians with their dick in their face
