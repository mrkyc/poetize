It's my blood, it's my thing
I'd escape for a while
It's my road, it's my scene
And I won't
Give it up, give it up, give it up
Keep me away from it all
Give it up, give it up, give it up
Keep me away from it all
I was raised, on the side
An invisible borderline
I'll be gone for a while
But I'll make it back
I was raised, on the side
An invisible borderline
I'll be gone for a while
But I'll make it back
Make it back to you
Make it back
Make it back to you
Make it back
You might also likeMake it back to you
Make it back
Make it back to you
Make it back
I feel safe in the wild
It's my place, it's what I need
There's no peace in the silence
It's what I shout, it's what I sing
And I won't
Give it up, give it up, give it up
Keep me away from it all (It's what I shout, it's what I sing)
Give it up, give it up, give it up
Keep me away from it all (It's what I shout, it's what I sing)
I was raised, on the side
An invisible borderline
I'll be gone for a while
But I'll make it back (It's what I sing)
I was raised, on the side
An invisible borderline
I'll be gone for a while
(It's what I sing)
Make it back
Make it back, oh, oh
Make it back
Make it back
Make it back, oh, oh
Make it back
Make it back
Make it back, oh, oh
Make it back
Make it back
Make it back, oh, oh
Make it back
Make it back
Make it back, oh, oh
Make it back
Make it back
Make it back, oh, oh
