Walk into the party and I ruin everybody's mood
Say that I'm retarded but the stupid one is really you
I know that I got it, this just somethin' that I need to do
Beat so tough, ain't nothin' you put a needle thru
Grimey ass fit, I'm lookin' somewhat like beetle juice
Got a couple shooters, that mean I don't need a heater dude
Been to Calabasas and spit on a heavy beat or two, see I done
Already seen where I wanna be
I'm doin' what I gotta do and know it ain't for free
But a motherfucker really wrote a song with Tommy Lee
When I'm out inside my city nobody acknowledge me
It's funny 'cause I can see the jealousy boiling
It's overflowing, they knowing they can't get no shit for free
They can get no more from me, my hands are now empty
And you wanna stir up beef, you might end up as dead meat, whoa
I'm so tired anyway
I'm so tired of the gang
Leave me alone, said
Ain't nobody help me get paid
Ain't nobody wanna see me change
So I'm on my own, said
I don't need a 'Rari or a Wraith
Stay inside the studio for days
That's just how it goes, hey
Been about it, I got what it takes
Bit too easy, you can raise the stakes
Just leave me alone, yeah
You might also likeReally I don't need no friends or fuckin' buddy's now
I wanna see the look on their face when I shut it down
I'm in between on what I know and what I'm finding out
I know if it's a marathon, I'm never tired out
Feet on the ground, but I run it up on the track
Punchlines hitting like a serious attack
Bitch, I'm one punch man, one take that's that
Ain't no jump man, one wave over that
I'm so tired anyway
I'm so tired of the gang
Leave me alone, said
Ain't nobody help me get paid
Ain't nobody wanna see me change
So I'm on my own, said
I don't need a 'Rari or a Wraith
Stay inside the studio for days
That's just how it goes, hey
Been about it I got what it takes
Bit too easy you can raise the stakes
