Find a wheel and it goes round, round, round
As it skims along with a happy sound
As it goes along the ground, ground, ground
Till it leads you to the one you love
Then your love will hold you round, round, round
And your heart's a song with a brand new sound
And your head goes spinnin' round, round, round
'Cause you found what you been dreamin' of

In the night you see the oval moon
Goin' round and round in tune
And the ball of sun in the day
Makes a girl and boy wanna say

Find a ring (Find a ring) and put it round, round, round
And with ties so strong the two hearts are bound
Put it on (Put it on) the one you found, found, found
For you know that this is really love (This is really love)
Find a wheel (Find a wheel) and it goes round, round, round
As it skims along with a happy sound
As it goes (As it goes) along the ground, ground, ground
Till it leads you to the one you love! (To the one you love)
You might also likeThen your love (Then your love) you'll hold her round, round, round
And your heart's a song with a brand new sound
And your head (And your head) goes spinning round, round, round
'Cause you found what you've been dreamin' of (You've been dreaming of)

In the night you see the oval moon
Goin' round and round in tune (Going round and round)
And the ball of sun in the day
Makes a girl and boy wanna say (Wanna say, wanna say)

Find the ring (Find the ring) and put it round, round, round
And with ties so strong your two hearts are bound
Put it on, the one you found, found, found
For you know that this is really love

Find the ring, put it on
For you know that this is really love
Really love, really love
