I never had to say goodbye
You must have known I wouldn't stay
While you were talking about our life
You killed the beauty of today

Forever and ever, life is now or never
Forever never comes around (People love and let go)
Forever and ever, life is now or never
Forever's gonna slow you down

You'll never see me again
So now who's gonna cry for you?
You'll never see me again
No matter what you do
You'll never see me again
So now who's gonna cry for you?
You'll never see me again
No matter what you do

Na-na-na-na-na

You never heard me break your heart
You didn't wake up when we died
Since I was lonely from the start
I think the end is mine to write

So now who's gonna cry for you?
You'll never see me again
No matter what you do
You'll never see me again
So now who's gonna cry for you?
You'll never see me again
No matter what you do

Forever and ever, life is now or never
Forever never comes around (People love and let go)
Forever and ever, life is now or never
