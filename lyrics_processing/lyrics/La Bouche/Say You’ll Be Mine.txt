And I will never get enough of your sweet love
And now I need you boy, in my world
You make all the dark clouds disappear
You keep telling me all the words I always want to hear
And now I need you boy, in my world
Could it be magic, I found out what love can do
Could it be magic, I'll do anything for you
Say you'll be mine, until the end
Say you could never lose your loving feeling in a million years
Say you'll be mine, until the end
Say you've been searching for a world of passion, and for sweet obsession all the time
Say you'll be mine
Take it as it is and picture this- I'm on fire and I shiver every time we kiss
And now I need you boy, I my world
Once you've had a tender touch of paradise, you wanna keep the pace
You make me realise how much I need you boy, in my world
Could it be magic, I found what love can do
Could it be magic, I'd do anything for you
Say you'll be mine, until the end
Say you could never lose your loving feeling in a million years
Say you'll be mine, until the end
