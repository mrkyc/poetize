Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain, against my window
Cause' he ain't hearing me
You I can't stand the rain, I can't stand the pain
If it keeps going on it's a damn shame
Watching you going through the misery and strife
The pain, the angst, living this old life
The men you knew only wanted one thing
To control you, mould and make you new
You used to be strong telling me to hold on
But I'm telling you girl, you really got it going on
Take a look in the mirror, take a look at yourself
See who you are, and what you are
And you better realise, oo-ah, that the life that you lead is the one that you chose
I can't stand it, I can't stand it, I can't stand it
When we were together, everything was so grand
But now that we've parted, there's just one thing that I just can't stand-
I can't stand the rain against my window, bringing back sweet memories
You I can't stand the rain, I can't stand the pain
If it keeps going on it's a damn shame
Watching you going through the misery and strife
The pain, the angst, living this old life
The men you knew only wanted one thing
To control you, mould and make you new
You used to be strong telling me to hold on
But I'm telling you girl, you really got it going on
Take a look in the mirror, take a look at yourself
See who you are, and what you are
And you better realise, oo-ah, that the life that you lead is the one that you chose
I can't stand it, I can't stand it, I can't stand it
I can't stand the rain, against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain, against my window
Cause' he ain't hearing me
