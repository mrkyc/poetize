Like sitting on a ferris wheel
Watching the world go around and around it goes
Maybe that's how lovers feel
Up and down, where it stops nobody knows
How many tears
Or How many broken hearts
Just how many sorrows
How much you'll take

Lonely heart of a little boy
Waiting for his daddy with a brand new toy
Lonely eyes of a pretty little girl
