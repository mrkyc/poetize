I wanna take it nice 'n' slow
Well baby from the first time I saw you, I knew I had to have you
I just couldn't wait any longer, I want you body and soul
When I first saw you , you looked so fine you blew my mind I just knew that I was seein' a dream
Tryin' to maintain my composure as I made my move to call you over to sit next to me
You looked my way with your sexy smile, I felt just like a schoolgirl
I was so nervous I could not move, with one look you rocked my world
Don't you want to try it we can take it nice 'n' slow
If you say you like it I will never let you go
I called you up, to my surprise, you remembered me, you were waiting for me to dial your number
Wanted to see me, no hesitation came from me, must of been that magic spell I was under
So beautiful, just one night with you, I can't imagine it all
So you just open up your heart come and share my dream, together we can fly away
Don't you want to try it we can take it nice 'n' slow
If you say you like it I will never let you go
Don't you want to try it we can take it nice 'n' slow
If you say you like it I will never let you go
Baby don't you wanna take control of me, let me be your one and only fantasy
Given myself to you totally...
