Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancin'
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are takin' over
Sweet dreams of dancin' through the night

I wanna get into motion, a better devotion
So I can make it through the night
So the music is playin', you know what I'm sayin'
Now everything will be alright

Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancin'
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are takin' over
Sweet dreams of dancin' through the night (Oh-oh, oh)

Ola ola eh, ola ola eh
Ola ola eh, ola ola eh

Keep dancin' hard
Give this groove more feeling
Dance, trance, dance, more dealing
In, out, up, down, all around
On the dance floor gettin' down
Hot stuff is what I'm calling this
These dreams  definitely can't miss
Have you dancin' right in the night
Sweet dreamin' all through the night
You might also likeTake time just to show them who
We can make your body move
Shake your body with all your might
Shake the power, gonna make it ride
On the dancefloor, much too near
Move your butt, now have no fear
Totally, yes, the party's started
Sweet dreams keep comin' harder

Rhythm is a creation, a better sensation
That will lead you through the night
When your body is movin', the music is groovin'
I wanna take you home tonight

Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancin'
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are takin' over
Sweet dreams of dancin' through the night (Oh-oh, oh)

Ola ola eh, ola ola eh
Ola ola eh, ola ola eh

I got a sweet dream of rhythm and passion
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
I got a sweet dream of rhythm and passion
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
Ola ola eh, ola ola eh
Ola ola eh, ola ola eh
Ola ola eh, ola ola eh
Ola ola eh, ola ola eh

Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancin'
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are takin' over
Sweet dreams of dancin' through the night
Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancin'
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are takin' over
