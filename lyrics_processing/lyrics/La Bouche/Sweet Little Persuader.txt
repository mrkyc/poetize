Sweet sweet little persuader
Sweet sweet little persuader
You're a sly one on the run, stealing every heart that you see
I was a easy mark in the dark, you took my heart from right under me, yeh
My hands were tied, I couldn't fight, you stole my soul in the heat of the night
Now baby here I am in your hands, I'll do anything that you say, yeh
And when the light goes down, you know how, just to how get your way
You've got my heart, my heart on a string, got what it takes to take everything
And with just one little smile you know there's nothing I won't do, won't do for you. And when you look in my eyes you know that I'm just a helpless fool, just a fool for you

Your eyes hypnotise, lock me in the spell of your love, I'm a prisoner to your every move, baby I'm chained to your touch. My world is yours, my hearts on it's knees, you can drive the car baby, you've got the keys. And with just one little smile, you know there's nothing I won't do, won't do for you. And when you look in my eyes you know that I'm just a helpless fool, just a fool for you
