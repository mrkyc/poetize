I was out for love and there you stood
I prayed to God to make it last
Boy I never fell in love so fast
You give me everything I've been dreaming of
I got you under my skin, I can't get enough
Shoo bee do bee do I like that way
Boy I need you every single day
Shoo bee do bee do I've found my way
Straight into your heart please let me stay
There's a light in your eyes
Boy you really got me hynotised
And when we kiss (and when we kiss)
It makes me weak (it makes me weak)
Boy you really knock me off my feet
You give me everything I've been dreaming of
I got you under my skin, I can't get enough
Shoo bee do bee do I like that way
Boy I need you every single day
Shoo bee do bee do I've found my way
Straight into your heart please let me stay

Yes yes ya'll, you don't quit, you don't quit
Hold it, wait a minute
Lane in the house with that old school flavour
Ya'll save ya, shake what your mamma gave ya
Have to adapt it in a beat that's phat
Heres the facts, La Bouche is all that
Crowds getting loud, and their begging us just to get on down
Everywhere we go is a stomping ground
Ten-thousand people with their hands in the air, screaming out "Oh yeah"
My ? will never ? ? ? Mamma's got a brand new bag
Should be a crime to think it don't rhyme
Come on and hit me one time (huh)
Shoo bee do bee do I like that way
Boy I need you every single day
Shoo bee do bee do I've found my way
Straight into your heart please let me stay
Shoo bee do bee do I like that way
Boy I need you every single day
Shoo bee do bee do I've found my way
