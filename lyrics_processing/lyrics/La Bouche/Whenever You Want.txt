Whenever you need my love, call me I'll be there
Whenever you want my love, call me I'll be there
Whenever you need my love, call me I'll be there
We've been together, seems like a long time
Somehow we've fallen from a mountain so hard to climb
I think it's time for us to pick up the pieces
And find a new way to become the friends we were once before
Whenever you want my love, call me I'll be there
Whenever you need my love, call me I'll be there
Whenever you want my love, call me I'll be there
Whenever you need my love, call me I'll be there

I can remember going place that were everywhere
Now we're just going through the motions feeling nothing there
If we could try maybe we'd pick up the pieces, I know we can, yes we can
Then we could be friends like we were once before
Whenever you want my love, call me I'll be there
Whenever you need my love, call me I'll be there
Whenever you want my love, call me I'll be there
Whenever you need my love, call me I'll be there
