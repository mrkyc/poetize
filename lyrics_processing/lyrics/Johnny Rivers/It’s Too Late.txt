I would try in every way
To hold you, and love you
And kiss you and keep you
Till my dying day
You just laughed
Said you found somebody new
Someone to make me
Forget about you
And now you tell me
That your new love
Isn't true
Like he should be
You say you're gonna forget him
And you're gonna come back to me
But things have changed
I got me somebody new
Someone to make me
Forget about you
I'm telling you
That it's too late
To say you're sorry
It's too late
To say you're mine
I have found myself a new love
And I'm gonna make her mine
You might also likeIt's too late
It's too late
Many days I tried to call you
Many nights I sat alone
Everyone knew that I loved you
But you had a love of your own
And now that he's gone
You think you can come back to me
I'm not the same fool
That I used to be
And you're gonna see
That it's too late
To say you're sorry
It's too late
To say you're mine
I have found myself a new love
And I'm gonna make her mine
It's too late
It's too late
To say you're mine
I remember when I told you
I would try in every way
To hold you, and kiss you
And keep you, baby
Till my dying day
But you just laughed, ha
Said you found somebody new
Someone to make me
Forget about you
And then you tell me
That this new love
Isn't true
Like he should be
You say that you're gonna forget him
And you're gonna come back to me
But things have changed
I got me somebody new
Someone to make me
Forget about you
I'm telling you
That it's too late
To say you're sorry
It's too late
To say you're mine
I have found myself a new love
And I'm gonna make her mine
It's too late
It's too late
To say you're mine
