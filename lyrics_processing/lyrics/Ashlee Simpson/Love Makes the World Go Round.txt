Here, here I am again
And I'm staring at these same four walls
Alone again
And now, all the colors blend
And I'm growing numb and I've become
This empty page

Hold on, it's tragic
Stumbling through all this static

I just wanna talk to you
And my broken heart just has no use
And I guess promises are better left unsaid, yeah
But every time you try to tell me
You say the words that I'm the only
But I'm the one who's crawling on the ground
When you say love makes the world go round

My love (My love), look at what you've done to me
For someone who has felt so strong
It's amazing I'm completely gone
You might also like
Hold on, it's tragic
Stumbling through all this static

I just wanna talk to you
And my broken heart just has no use
And I guess promises are better left unsaid, yeah
And every time you try to tell me
You say the words that I'm the only
But I'm the one who's crawling on the ground
When you say love makes the world go round

If that's the kind of love you give me
I'd rather be alone, believe me
Is that the way you 'posed to treat me?
I'd rather walk away

I just wanna talk to you
And my broken heart just has no use
And I guess promises are better left unsaid, yeah
And every time you try to tell me
You say the words that I'm the only
But I'm the one who's crawling on the ground
When you say love makes the world go round, yeah
You say love makes the world go round
Every time you try to tell me
I don't care, you're not the only
Don't you know I'm coming back around?
'Cause I say love makes the world go round, yeah
