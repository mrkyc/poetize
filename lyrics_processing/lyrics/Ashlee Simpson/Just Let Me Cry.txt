I'm about to lose control

I, I don't know why
Why you need some reason to feel lost inside
You (You), you know that I'm alright
You know that I'm just the kind of girl that feels so hurt and smiles

I don't want excuses
Don't ask why
It's just a breakdown
It happens all the time
So get out of my face
Don't even try
You wanna help me
Just let me cry

Yeah (Yeah), I loved you all my life
You don't even know one thing I feel inside
Know, by the look in my eye (Eye)
That I'm just fine, but I might need you to hold me tight

I don't want excuses
Don't ask why
It's just a breakdown
It happens all the time
So get out of my face
Don't even try
You wanna help me, just let me
I don't want excuses
Don't ask why
It's just a breakdown
It happens all the time
So get out of my face
Don't even try
You wanna help me
Just let me
