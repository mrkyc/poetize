I threw away my phone
I thought that you should know
I'd throw away my home
If I had somewhere to go
Anything to stop
The circle in my brain
Anything is better than you
Making me feel lame

Twenty-eight days to kick a habit
Twenty-eight days to let you go
Twenty-eight days and I'll be on my own

All my life I've been sorry for something
Something gets me nothing, and nothing's such a waste
All this time I've been sayin' I'm sorry
But why should I be sorry for all of your mistakes?
Why should I be sorry? (Sorry)

I've had enough of you
Please forget my name
I'm running around on empty
Still trying to get away
Anything to kill
The consciousness of you
Anything to rid myself
Of all of the abuse
You might also like
Twenty-eight days to kick a habit
Twenty-eight days to let you go
Twenty-eight days and I'll be on my own

All my life I've been sorry for something
Something gets me nothing, and nothing's such a waste
All this time I've been sayin' I'm sorry
But why should I be sorry for all of your mistakes?

Now you'll know what it feels like to bite your tongue
Now you'll know what it feels like to be the one
Who walks around with knots in your stomach
I've been there, and I've done it
And now you'll know what it feels like to always be afraid
Of everything you wanted to say
Who's sorry now? Who's sorry now?
Who's sorry now?

All my life I've been sorry for something
Something gets me nothing, and nothing's such a waste
All this time I've been sayin' I'm sorry
But why should I be sorry for all of your mistakes?
All my life I've been sorry for something
Something gets me nothing, and nothing's such a waste
(I've been there, and I've done it)
All this time I've been sayin' I'm sorry
But why should I be sorry for all of your mistakes?
