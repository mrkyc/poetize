Take it back, take it all back now
The things I gave, like the taste of my kiss on your lips
I miss that now
I can't try any harder than I do
All the reasons I gave, excuses I made for you
I'm broken in two

All the things left undiscovered
Leave me empty and left to wonder
I need you
All the things left undiscovered
Leave me waiting and left to wonder
I need you
Yeah, I need you
Don't walk away

Touch me now
How I wanna feel something so real
Please remind me
My love, take me back
'Cause I'm so in love with what we were
I'm not breathing, I'm suffocating without you
Do you feel it too?
You might also like
All the things left undiscovered
Leave me waiting and left to wonder
I need you
All the things left undiscovered
Leave me empty and left to wonder
I need you
Yeah, I need you

When I'm in the dark and all alone
Dreaming that you'll walk right through my door
It's there I know my heart is whole
There's a million reasons why I cry
Hold my covers tight and close my eyes
'Cause I don't wanna be alone

All the things left undiscovered
Leave me waiting and left to wonder
I need you
All the things left undiscovered
Leave me empty and left to wonder
I need you
I need you
'Cause I can't fake and I can't hate
But it's my heart that's about to break
You're all I need, I'm on my knees
Watch me bleed
Would you listen, please?
I give in, I breathe out
I want you, there's no doubt
I freak out, I'm left out
Without you, I'm without
I'm crossed out, I'm kicked out
I cry out, I reach out

Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
