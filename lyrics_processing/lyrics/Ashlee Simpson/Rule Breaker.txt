Um, excuse me, ut uh
I-is this on?

I got a boyfriend
He loves to fight a lot
We gotta lot in common
And he thinks I'm **** hot
He likes to break rules
Both got tattoos
We tend to smash things
And we like to scream like (Ah)

You don't want no problems
You ain't got no beef (Ah)
You don't want no problems
You ain't got no beef
I don't wanna fight, tonight
Hey, hey
But I ain't going home for no one
I don't wanna fight, tonight
Hey, hey
But I ain't going home for no one
You might also like
I just wanna color outside the lines
I've been reprimanded 'bout a thousand times
I'm a, rule breaker
You know that I'm a, rule breaker

S-s-s-s-ome say I'm a black sheep
'Cause I like to sleep late
Wake up 'round three o'clock
Drink until my tummy ache
Feels I'm a rebel
'Cause I keep making trouble
Get here on the double 'for I break a little sun'thin', like

You-you-you-you don't want no problems
You ain't got no beef (No)
(Ah) You better keep quiet if you want your teeth
I don't wanna fight, tonight
Hey, hey
But I ain't going home for no one (Uh-uh)
I don't wanna fight, tonight
Hey, hey
But I ain't going home for no one
I just wanna color outside the lines
I've been reprimanded about a thousand times
I'm a, rule breaker
You know that I'm a, rule breaker
I know you are, but what am I?

I'm daddy's little girl
Bundle of kisses
I'm just a princess
Little miss perfect
Everyone knows it
But that's another day
There's rules to break, yeah

I don't wanna fight, tonight
Hey, hey
But I ain't going home for no one
I don't wanna fight, tonight
Hey, hey
But I ain't going home for no one
I don't wanna fight, tonight
Hey, hey
But I ain't going home for no one (Ain't goin' home for you)
I don't wanna fight, tonight
Hey, hey
But I ain't going home for no one (No one)
I know the grass is greener on the other side
You-you-you-you don't want no problems
You ain't got no beef
I know tell you that you fought those pretty faces
You-you-you-you don't want no problems
You ain't got no beef
