(Hey, hey)

I've been thrown 'round once or twice
Beneath it all was born to fight
I hear your voice in my head and it's killing me
I've never been a fan of happy endings

Your love must be tainted
If it's how you paint it (Hey, hey)
You don't know what you're in for
You're so rotten to the core

Why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll?
(You can toss me out, you can toss me out)
I've been sitting back, keeping quiet for too long
(You can't touch me now, you can't touch me now)
Why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll?
(You can toss me out, you can toss me out)
You just wanna use me up 'til I'm all gone
(That's not me at all, whoa, that's not me at all, hey)
(Hey, hey)
You might also like
Won't try so hard, you can admit (Whoa)
Opened my heart, you never come in
Can't find my way through your maze (Whoa)
And in my mouth, you put a very bad taste

Your love must be tainted
If it's how you paint it (Hey, hey)
You don't know what you're in for
You're so rotten to the core

Why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll?
(You can toss me out, you can toss me out)
I've been sitting back, keeping quiet for too long
(You can't touch me now, you can't touch me now)
Why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll? (Whoa)
(You can toss me out, you can toss me out)
You just wanna use me up 'til I'm all gone (Whoa)
(That's not me at all, whoa, that's not me at all, hey)

Yo, I'm not a ragdoll
Yo, I'm not a ragdoll
Yo, I'm not a ragdoll
Yo
Don't you see my black tears?
Please don't make me stay here (Whoa)
Don't you see my black tears?
Please don't make me stay here, whoa

Why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll?
(You can toss me out, you can toss me out)
I've been sitting back, keeping quiet for too long
(You can't touch me now, you can't touch me now)
Why you gotta throw me around like a ragdoll? (Whoa)
(You can toss me out, you can toss me out)
You just wanna use me up 'til I'm all gone (Whoa)
(That's not me at all, whoa, that's not me at all, hey)

Yo, I'm not a ragdoll
Yo, I'm not a ragdoll
Yo, I'm not a ragdoll
Yo (Hey, hey)
Yo (Hey, hey)
Yo, I'm not a ragdoll
Yo, I'm not a ragdoll
