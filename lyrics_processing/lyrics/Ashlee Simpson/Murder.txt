You tell me to leave, but I come back again
I don't see what all the fuss is about 'cause I'm okay
(Okay, okay, uh)

And he was a good boy until he got behind me

He helpin' me get it off, he helpin' me get it off
Ooh, I got a monkey on my back
He helpin' me get it off, he helpin' me get it off

You can call me, you know you can trust me
Without me, you're headed to your doom, doom, doom

I'll be your alibi (Bi-bi-bi)
