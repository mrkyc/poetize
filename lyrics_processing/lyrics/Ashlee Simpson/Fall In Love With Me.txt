Let's run away
Name a place
Where the air tastes like rain
And the sun shines like Sunday morning
You'll bring your laugh, and I'll
I'll bring my sense of humor
And we can waste the days
One week after another

Turn it up, turn it up, I'm fallin'
Turn the music up and fall in love with me
Turn it up, turn it up, I'm fallin'
Turn the music up and fall in love with me

Da-da-da-da

Don't need a book
Don't need anything, but
The art of conversation and the lovely gift of sleep
We won't leave 'til sand's in everything and
Hearts are full of breeze
And we've caught up on our daydreaming
You might also like
Turn it up, turn it up, I'm fallin'
Turn the music up and fall in love with me
Turn it up, turn it up, I'm fallin'
Turn the music up and fall in love with me
Turn it up, turn it up, I'm fallin'
Turn the music up and fall in love with me
Turn it up, turn it up, I'm fallin'
Turn the music up and fall in love with me

When the night comes
We can stay in bed
What's left to talk about is better left unsaid

Turn it up, turn it up, I'm fallin'
Turn the music up and fall in love with me (Fall in love with me)
Turn it up, turn it up, I'm fallin' (In love)
Turn the music up and fall in love with me
Turn it up, turn it up, I'm fallin'
Turn the music up and fall in love with me (Fall in love)
Turn it up, turn it up, I'm fallin'
Turn the music up and fall in love with me
Turn it up, turn it up, I'm fallin' (Fall in love with me)
Turn the music up and fall in love with me
Turn it up, turn it up, I'm fallin' (Da-da-da-da)
Turn the music up and fall in love
