Lovesick dreamin' when we first met
You gave me your world with no regrets
Never thought anything could come against
But oh, what did I know?
One missed step and I'm on my own
You wash your hands clean of me right or wrong
Behind closed doors, I was broken though
Tryna keep it out of sight of the world
I couldn't say

A million miles that I have gone
Signs that say to give it up (Give it up)
Just tear me down or lift me up
No time for tears, no time for tears
No time for tears

Pull myself together and hear the sounds
Oh, my heart's been thrown around
I gave you my sky before I found my ground
And God, what did I know?
Now come on, come on
You got me wrong (Come on, come on)
Come on, come on (Come on, come on)
Just play along
That's love sick dreaming when we first met
Tryna keep in on top of the world
I need to say
You might also like
A million miles that I have gone
Signs that say to give it up (Give it up)
Just tear me down or lift me up
No time for tears, no time for tears
I'm callin' out, what is done is done
Now's that time to shake it off
The crazy cycle's going on
No time for tears
No time for tears
No time for tears
No time for tears

Get up, get up, get up, to feel better
Get up, get up, get up, to feel better
No time for tears
Get up, get up, get up, to feel better
Get up, get up, get up, to feel better (Shake it off)
No time for tears
Get up, get up, get up, to feel better (A million miles that I have gone)
Get up, get up, get up, to feel better (Signs that say to give it up)
Just tear me down or lift me up
No time for tears, no time for tears

No time for tears
No time for tears (No time for tears)
No time for tears
No time for tears (Shake it off)
No time for tears (Shake it off)
No time for tears (No time, hey, hey)
No time for tears
Signs that say (No time for tears, hey)
