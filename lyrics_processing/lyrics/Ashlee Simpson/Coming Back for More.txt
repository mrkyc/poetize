Sunday morning blues, always about you
I wake up alone in a big room
Got myself to blame for all my bad moods
And I really wish that I didn't feel this way
I wanna break the circle, but the circle won't break

But I don't wanna spend another night
Trying to figure out why you're always on my mind
Whoa, all I know
You keep me coming back for more
Even when I think I've had enough
When I tell you that it's over, that we're done
Oh, don't let go
Just keep me coming back for more

You keep me coming, coming, coming, coming back

Two weeks and three whole days, and I give in
I was doing so good, but you always win
And I really wish sometimes that we would just move on
But what would I be doing if you were gone?
You might also like
But I don't wanna spend another night
Trying to figure out why you're always on my mind
Whoa, all I know
You keep me coming back for more
Even when I think I've had enough
When I tell you that it's over, that we're done
Oh, don't let go
Just keep me coming back for more

You always find a way to make me wanna stay
You'll never get away from me
Oh, oh, oh

But I don't wanna spend another night
Trying to figure out why you're always on my mind
Whoa (Whoa), all I know (I know)
You keep me coming back for more
Even when I think I've had enough
When I tell you that it's over, that we're done
Oh (Oh), don't let go (Let go)
Just keep me coming back for more

You keep me coming, coming, coming, coming back for more
Coming back for more
You keep me coming, coming, coming, coming back for more
