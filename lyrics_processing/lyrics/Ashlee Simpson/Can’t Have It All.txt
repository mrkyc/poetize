Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh

Maybe it's just that we met up under false terms
Or maybe the universe is playing jokes on us
Try to keep my light on
Try to keep my light on for you
Oh, boy, did you know?

I got my feet on the ground
You would not know me now
Gotta keep my world in check
Believe me when I say it's over
'Cause I know, I know, I know

I tried, but I can't fake it
I see you calling, but I know I can't take it
After coverin' all those bases
Been here before, you should know
You can't have it all

Looking back now
I can see I made some mistakes (Ah)
Apologizing when you were wrong
Then pain for your place (Ah)
Cut my heart open
I laid it all out now
I changed the locks, you know
You might also like
I got my feet on the ground
You would not know me now
Gotta keep my world in check
Believe me when I say it's over
'Cause I know, I know, I know

I tried, but I can't fake it
I see you calling, but I know I can't take it
After coverin' all those bases
Been here before, you should know
You can't have it all
Been here before, you should know
You can't have it all

Oh, you know you left me sideways
I'm done with all your highs and goodbye's, babe
Sometimes the stars don't align and it's okay
Yeah, we're broken
Oh, you can't take it

I tried, but I can't fake it
I see you calling, but I know I can't take it
After coverin' all those bases
Been here before, you should know
You can't have it all
Been here before, you should know
