I walk alone inside these walls and it's not easy being me
It seems like every time I escape, there's another following
Me, I'm runnin', yeah, they're comin'
I can feel them shootin' me
Without askin', lights are flashin', but I guess that

It's what I've become, let me live as who I am
Never wanted nothing, but you don't let me breathe as who I am
I've just begun, I've just begun, I've just begun to find my way
I've just begun, I've just begun, I've just begun to find my way

In the chase, I know I'm wanted
Hey, look, I'm no victim
It'd be nice to make some mistakes without observations
Or opinions of distortions
Deceiving what you're believing
It's a shame that all these blessings can be a curse

It's what I've become, let me live as who I am
Never wanted nothing, but you don't let me breathe as who I am
I've just begun, I've just begun, I've just begun to find my way
I've just begun, I've just begun, I've just begun to find my way

There's not a pill to take to save me from this heartache
But I have no regrets, I'm hoping for a better day
There's not a pill to take to save me from this heartache
But I have no regrets, I'm hoping for a better day

It's what I've become (Whoa), let me live as who I am
Never wanted nothing (Whoa), but you don't let me breathe as who I am
It's what I've become (Whoa), let me live as who I am
Never wanted nothing (Whoa), but you don't let me breathe as who I am
I've just begun, I've just begun
I've just begun to find my way
I've just begun, I've just begun
I've just begun to find my way

Ah, ah, ah, ah
