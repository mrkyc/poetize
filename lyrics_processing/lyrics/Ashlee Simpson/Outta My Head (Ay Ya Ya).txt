(What?)
Is that all you got to say?
(What? What?)
You're rubbin' me the wrong way
(See your lips moving)
But I don't catch a word you say
(Shut up your chatter)
I need for you to go away (Uh-huh)

And all I hear is "Ay ya ya ya ya"
You're talking way too much
I can't even hear me now
All your noise is messing with my head
You're in my head
Get outta my head

Outta my, outta my head (Want you outta my head)
Outta my, outta my head (Get out of my head)
Outta my, outta my head (Want you outta my head)
Outta my, outta my head (That's what I said)

(What?)
You looking at me for (Huh?)
(Show me)
Respect or I will show you the door
(Get out that door)
Lately
I've got a problem with the way that you behave
(You're too much)
And all your pushin' don't leave enough room for me
Ha, ha-ha
You might also like
And all I hear is "Ay ya ya ya ya" (Ah)
You're talking way too much
I can't even hear me now (Ah)
All your noise is messing with my head
You're in my head
Get outta my head

Outta my, outta my head (Want you outta my head)
Outta my, outta my head (Get out of my head)
Outta my, outta my head (Want you outta my head)
Outta my, outta my head

And all I hear is "Ay ya ya ya ya" (Ah)
You're talking way too much
I can't even hear me now (Ah)
All your noise is messing with my head
You're in my head
Get outta my head

All your opinions, keep 'em to yourself
Just let me think so I can hear myself
Wouldn't it be nice if I could just go solo, take the day off?
I'd be alright if you would leave me to it, back the **** off
Ay ya ya ya ya
You're talking way too much
You tell me one more time how I should live
I swear I'll bite your head off
I am who I am, and I can't be no one else
You've got nothing nice to say
Keep your comments to yourself (Ow)
Outta my, outta my head (Want you outta my head)
Outta my, outta my head (Get out of my head)
Outta my, outta my head (Want you outta my head)
Outta my, outta my head

And all I hear is "Ay ya ya ya ya" (Ah)
You're talking way too much
I can't even hear me now (Ah)
All your noise is messing with my head
You're in my head
Get outta my head

Outta my, outta my head (Want you outta my head)
Outta my, outta my head (Get out of my head)
Outta my, outta my head (Want you outta my head)
Outta my, outta my head

And all I hear is "Ay ya ya ya ya" (Ah)
You're talking way too much
I can't even hear me now (Ah)
All your noise is messing with my head
You're in my head
