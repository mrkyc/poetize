Tragic
Everybody tryin' to hide all of those habits
It's kind of bizarre when it's who you are
It's tragic that it's come to this
I bury all of my vices
Tryin' to keep my head up over it
When everything's whatever

It's the be all end all
And right before we fade away
Call a spade a spade, and you should know
You can tell it's a bittersweet world
Why can't we all just get along?
In this bittersweet world
Everybody reapin' what they sow
In this
Sweet world

Whatever happened to the magic that was keepin' us
The faith that was the on stardust
Now there's hypocrites pointing fingers
With three fingers pointing right back
And all we're left with is (And all we're left with is)
And all we're left with is (And all we're left with is)
And all we're left with is (And all we're left with is)
The foolish pride and quick fixes, yeah
You might also like
It's the be all end all (Be all end all)
And right before we fade away
Call a spade a spade, and you should know
You can tell it's a bittersweet world
Why can't we all just get along?
In this bittersweet world
Everybody reapin' what they sow
In this bittersweet world
With closets full of skeletons
I'm a bittersweet girl
Demons out to get me as I stand alone

There's a universal bottom line
Everybody's in disguise, even you and I
Behind the facade, tryna get by
Don't wanna burn, but wanna play with fire (Again)
There's a universal bottom line
Everybody's in disguise, even you and I
Behind the facade, tryna get by
You wanna play with fire
You're gonna get burned, 'cause

It's the be all end all (Be all end all)
And right before we fade away
Call a spade a spade, and you should know
You can tell
It's the be all end all (Be all end all)
And right before we fade away
Call a spade a spade, and you should know
You should know
It's a bittersweet world
Why can't we all just get along?
In this bittersweet world
Everybody reapin' what they sow
In this bittersweet world
With closets full of skeletons
I'm a bittersweet girl
