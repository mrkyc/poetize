I was six years old
When my parents went away
I was stuck inside a broken life
I couldn't wish away
She was beautiful
She had everything and more
And my escape was hiding out and running for the door

Somebody listen please
It used to be so hard being me

Living in the shadow
Of someone else's dream
Tryna find a hand to hold
But every touch felt cold to me
Living in a nightmare
A never-ending sleep
But now that I am wide awake
My chains are finally free
Don't feel sorry for me

All the days collided
One less perfect than the next
I was stuck inside someone else's life and always second best
Oh, I love you now, 'cause now I realize
That it's safe outside to come alive in my identity
You might also like
So if you're listening
There's so much more to me you haven't seen

Living in the shadow
Of someone else's dream
Tryna find a hand to hold
But every touch felt cold to me
Living in a nightmare
A never-ending sleep
But now that I am wide awake
Then I can finally see
Don't feel sorry for me

Mother, sister, father, sister, mother
Everything's cool now
Mother, sister, father, sister, mother
Everything's cool now
Oh, my life is good
I've got more than anyone should
Oh, my life is good
And the past is in the past

I was living in the shadow of someone else's dream
Tryna find a hand to hold
But every touch felt cold to me
I'm living in a new day, I'm living it for me
And now that I am wide awake
Yeah, I can finally be
So don't feel sorry for me
Don't feel sorry, don't feel sorry for me
Don't feel sorry, don't feel sorry for me
Living in, living in, living in the shadow
