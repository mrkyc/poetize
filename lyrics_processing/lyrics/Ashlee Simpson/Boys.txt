Some say I make the guys hypnotized
When I bat my eyes and walk past
They say I'm such a tease, but that's just me
Take it or leave it, baby

Don't mean to impose, boy, I'll let you know
You're hearin' me say "Yes," I'm sayin' "No"
I'm not one of those girls you think that you know
So you can talk that talk, but listen

Boys, boys, boys
They give me, give me
They give me
They follow my voice
Boys, boys
They give me, give me
They give me

Some say that I always insinuate
I can get my way, it's so true
Because my kiss is like (Mwah) kryptonite
I can make 'em weak, I'm so cruel
You might also like
Don't mean to impose, boy, I'll let you know
You're hearin' me say "Yes," I'm sayin' "No"
But you'll never get the best of me
'Cause I get what I want and I know what I need

Boys, boys, boys
They give me, give me
They give me
They follow my voice
Boys, boys
They give me, give me
They give me

Use your head, but not that one
One track mind, your one track mind, your one track mind
Use your head, but not that one
One track mind, your one track mind, your one track mind

Don't mean to impose, boy, I'll let you know
You're hearin' me say "Yes," I'm sayin' "No"
But you'll never get the best of me
'Cause I get what I want and I know what I need
Boys, boys, boys
They give me, give me
They give me
They follow my voice
Boys, boys
They give me, give me
They give me
Boys, boys, boys
They give me, give me (Boys, boys)
They give me
They follow my voice
Boys, boys
They give me, give me (Boys, boys)
They give me

Boys, boys
Boys, boys
