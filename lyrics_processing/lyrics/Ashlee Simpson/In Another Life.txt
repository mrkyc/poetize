Do you love me, oh, do you love me?
I say so
Do you need me, oh, do you need me?
God, I hope

I get this feeling deep inside
That somewhere, somehow you passed me by
I can't put my finger on it, but
The more that I see you, the more that I know

Everywhere you go is everywhere I've been
You finish all my sentences before they begin
And I know that look in your eyes
It's like I've seen you before about a million times
In another life, in another life, maybe
In another life, you must have been mine, oh

You make me feel so
Oh, you make me feel so
Beautiful
It doesn't matter
No, it never matters if we're out or home
You might also like
We can make hours into years
Wherever you go, you're always here
It's like I've known you from before
But I'm just so happy you walked through my door

Everywhere you go is everywhere I've been
You finish all my sentences before they begin
And I know that look in your eyes
It's like I've seen you before about a million times
In another life, in another life, maybe
In another life, you must have been mine

I'm breathing you in, I'm breathing you out
You're all around me
No matter what we do, I wanna spend my life with you
Only you
Do you love me, oh, do you love me?
Say you love me, oh, say you love me

Everywhere you go is everywhere I've been
You finish all my sentences before they begin
And I know that look in your eyes
It's like I've seen you before about a million times
In another life, in another life, maybe
In another life, you must have been mine
And I know that look in your eyes
It's like I've seen you before about a million times
In another life, in another life, maybe
In another life, you must have been mine
Do you love me?
