Every time that you're walking by, I feel the vibe inside
There's something about the way you are that's giving me butterflies
Maybe the planets have aligned, maybe it's all in my mind
So let me just introduce myself, before I get too shy
I've seen you in my dreams at night, to you, I fantasize

You caught my eye, you're just so fine
You caught my eye, you're just so fine

I'm burnin'
Up for you
I'm burnin'
Up for you

I see diamonds in the sky
Touch my hand and I can fly
All this is a mystery
So come on, come on and dance with me

I can't believe it's 4 AM, where did the time go?
I could sit here for days and days, just hanging with you alone
We got an instant history, some supernatural chemistry
Can't you feel it? Can you feel it? Oh
But I'm giving you my number now before this goes too far
It's getting really hot in here, and soon it will be hard

To say goodnight, the time's not right
So say goodnight, before I die

I'm burnin'
Up for you
I'm burnin'
Up for you

I see diamonds in the sky
Touch my hand and I can fly
All this is a mystery
So come on, come on and dance with me

You make me feel like fire
Is this love, or just desire?
You make me feel like fire
Is this love, or just desire?

I'm burnin' (Is this love?)
Up for you (Is this love?)
I'm burnin' (Or just desire)
Up for you (Or just desire)
I'm burnin' (I'm burnin' up)
Up for you (Is this love?)
I'm burnin' (I'm burnin' up)
Up for you (For you)
I see diamonds in the sky
Touch my hand and I can fly
All this is a mystery
So come on, come on and dance with me
I see diamonds in the sky
Touch my hand and I can fly
All this is a mystery
