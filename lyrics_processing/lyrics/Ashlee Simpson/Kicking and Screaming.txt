Don't get me waiting, anticipating
Treating me like a fool
I got news for you
I'm turning my back
I'm dropping a bomb on you
Ah

You want me, you need me
Believe me, you'll be calling
You love me, you hate me
Believe me, you'll come crawling

So get down and get off
Let me show you what you'll be missing
We break up, you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming

Don't get me guessing, I'm your favorite obsession
So give me that lame excuse
It's with me that your messing
It's the same old confession
You're the one with something to lose
Ah
You might also like
Watch out now, a blackout
There's no doubt, you can't have it
Control you, I'll own you
I'll show you, but you still can't have it

So get down and get off
Let me show you what you'll be missing
We break up, you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming
So get down and get off
You're not the only one that I've been missin'
We break up, you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming

You'll be kicking and screaming
You'll be kicking and screaming
(Ah) I'm so deceiving
You'll be kicking and screaming

Watch out now
You'll find out, you'll cry out
There's no one above me
I play hard, don't run far
Come back now
I really do like you
So get down and get off
Let me show you what you'll be missing
We break up, you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming
So get down and get off
You're not the only one that I've been missin'
We break up, you break down
Gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming

You'll be kicking and screaming
You'll be kicking and screaming
Kicking and screaming
