I've been through hell and back again
I shook hands with the devil, looked him in the eye
Looked like a long-lost friend
Oh, anything you want, any dirty deeds
He's got everything
'Cept what I really need
Keepin' me temporarily satisfied
But not one thing I tried
Filled me up inside or felt like mine
Mine all mine
Yeah, the search goes on, the more I look
My world keeps getting smaller
Staring at the sun, searching for the light
Almost endin' up blind
Some only see what they want to see
Claiming victory
Oh, but that's not me
Gimme truth, gimme something real
I just want to feel
Like it's mine, all mine
You might also likeOoh, really mine (Mine all mine)
Come on and gimme something (Ooh)
Something that's mine, all mine, all mine

Mine all mine
All the words on the wall look the same in the mirror
Every riddle and every clue
Oh, you got Allah in the east, you got Jesus in the west
Christ, what's a man to do?
They'll find a cure for anything
Just kill the pain
Oh, numb my brain
We see a man speaking the word of God
Proven to be a fraud
Oh, his own church applauds
Stop lookin' out, start lookin' in
Be your own best friend
Stand up and say
Hey, this is mine, ooh
All mine (Mine all mine), yeah
And, baby, you got something
Uh, and I got somethin' (Mine all mine)
Hey, and it's mine, all mine, all mine
Uh (Mine all mine), mmm
(Mine all mine) Yes, I'm searchin'
(Mine all mine) Well, I gotta have it
(Mine all mine) Ooh
(Mine all mine) Well
(Mine all mine) Gotta, gotta, got to
(Mine all mine) Got to have it, ow
(Mine all mine) Uh, uh, uh
(Mine all mine) You got, you got, you got, you got
