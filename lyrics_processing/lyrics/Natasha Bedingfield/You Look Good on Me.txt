Da, da, da, da, da, da
Oo oo oo

I'm goin' on a shopping spree
Pick something out to look good on me
I want quality
Not quantity
I want a classic
Not a trend
Casual, yet still high end
I know what I want
And I'm not afraid to spend

So if you
Fit me tight, but let me breathe
Let me wear your heart on my sleeve
Be the thread that winds the seams
You could look so good on me
Fit me like a second skin
My favorite jeans that I could live in
Wouldn't need accessories
You would look so good on me

Don't play it safe or too risque
I'm done window shoppin'

I'm going up
Fifth floor
The best stuff's in store
'Cause that's where they keep
What every girl would die for

So if you
Fit me tight, but let me breathe
Let me wear your heart on my sleeve
Be the thread that winds the seams
You could look so good on me
Fit me like a second skin
My favorite jeans that I could live in
Wouldn't need accessories
You would look so good on me

Ahh, ahh, ahh
Da. da. da. da. da, da
Ahh, ahh, ooh
Everything's perfect
When you're looking through the glass
The colors can fade as seasons pass
This time I wanna, wanna nail them to the mat
Ooh, yeah, yeah

Fit me tight, but let me breathe
Let me wear your heart on my sleeve
Be the thread that winds the seams
You could look so good on me
Fit me like a second skin
My favorite jeans that I could live in
Wouldn't need accessories
You would look so good on me
Fit me tight, but let me breathe
Let me wear your heart on my sleeve
Be the thread that winds the seams
You could look so good on me
Fit me like a second skin
My favorite jeans that I could live in
Wouldn't need accessories
You would look so good on me
