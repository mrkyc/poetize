Roll with me till the sun comes down
Roll with me all around London
Rollerskatin' in the parking lot
Roll with me till our wheels fall off
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Roll, I'm tryin' to keep up with you
But you're so fast and the pavement's bumpy
But you know that, oh yeah
And I think you kinda like that
Hot shot, all the tricks that you do
With your dance, stop, everybody wants you
But you know that, oh yeah
And I think you kinda like that
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah

Chasing the feeling
Gotta get outside these concrete ceilings
From a million miles away (Yeah), a million miles away
Chasing the feeling
Gotta get outside and find new meaning
I'm a million miles away, hey
