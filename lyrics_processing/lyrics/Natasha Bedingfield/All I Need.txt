(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)

I'm a dreamer, I'm a gypsy
I'm a river passing by
Got to run to keep up with me
I'm a sailor in the sky
And if I keep my heart open
If I wear it on my sleeve
No matter what life's throwing
Nothing's ever gonna get to me
(Hey, hey, hey)

All I need is what I've got
My soul is free and I've got more than enough
I believe in love and I'll never stop
That's why all I need is what I've got
Let it roll, roll, roll, right off my back
Let it flow, flow, flow, that's where I'm at
Let it roll, roll, roll, right off my back
Let it flow, flow, flow, that's where I'm at

I'm working up to something
So don't drag me down with you
We're all looking for that one thing
That's gonna pull us through
And I'll keep my heart open
Even if it starts to bleed
And all the daggers that you're throwing
They're gonna bounce right off of me
Hey, hey, hey

Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is? Forgot? I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Let it roll, roll, roll, right off my back
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

When I release (I release) and I set free (And I set free)
Giving fear it's amnesty
And I give in (I give in), and I let out (I let it)
Overthrowing any doubt (Oh)
This is my sanctuary, yeah (Sanctuary)

All I need is what I've got
My soul is free and I've got more than enough
I believe in love and I'll never stop
That's why all I need is what I've got
Because when I arrive
