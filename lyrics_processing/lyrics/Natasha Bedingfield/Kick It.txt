Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I didn't care?
Left it all on the kitchen table
For my heart to bear
We used to run along the shoreline
On the sands of Malibu
Holding hands in the shallow waters
Promises and I-love-yous
Oh, the stars we counted
Laying on the hood of your car (Oh yeah)
Oh now
And I'm praying for an endless summer
To heal the wounds and mend the scar, oh

Like a dozen bonfires
Lined up and down the road
Can't keep up with your baby
Do I need to let you go?
Something always turns ugly
Someone always gets mean
And the darkness that follows
Weighs too heavy on me

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Kick it if you wanna make it
Kick it if you wanna make it last
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Kick it if you wanna make it
Kick it if you wanna make it last

There's no hiding underneath the linen
I can see the sparks, low and high, low and high, low and high
I really wanna say I know ya, mmh
But the truth is I'd be tellin' a lie, tellin' a lie, tellin' a lie
Why he will never show you no mercy
She will just tell you things you wanna hear
Yeah, you wanna hear
I won't let you become a number, baby
I won't let you just disappear

Black and white exposure
Showing every single flaw
I thought you and I were special
Didn't think it'd be this hard

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Kick it if you wanna make it
Kick it if you wanna make it last
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Kick it if you wanna make it
Kick it if you wanna make it last
Kick it if you wanna make it
Kick it if you wanna make it last
Kick it if you wanna make it

Kick it if you wanna make it
Kick it if you wanna make it last
Oh, the world is ours forever
We can fill it with possibilities
I wanna be there when you're sleeping
Yeah, I wanna be there when you breathe
The pain we cause each other
The way we pull apart
Wrestling to fit together
Reaching an end to find a start

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Kick it if you wanna make it
Kick it if you wanna make it last (Make it last)
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh yeah, yeah)
Kick it if you wanna make it
Kick it if you wanna make it last
Kick it if you wanna make it
Kick it if you wanna make it last
Kick it if you wanna make it (Oh yeah)
Kick it if you wanna make it last
Kick it if you wanna make it
Kick it if you wanna make it last
Kick it if you wanna make it (Oh)
Kick it if you wanna make it last
