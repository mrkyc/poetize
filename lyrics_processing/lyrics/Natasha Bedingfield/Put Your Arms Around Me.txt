That's why I'm standing here today
(Whoa-oh, yeah, yeah, whoa-oh)
So many ups and downs and nothing's changed
That's why I know I'm here to stay
(Yeah, whoa-oh, yeah, uh, whoa-oh)

So put your arms around me and then stay there forever
Let it always be this way, you and me together (Yeah, uh)
So put your arms around me and I'll never let go
I know they're easy words to say, but I mean it more than ever
(Uh, yeah, sing it with me)

Yours is the kind of love, makes nothing else feel good enough
And I'm never gonna give you up, oh no, oh no (Yeah, up, yeah, up)
