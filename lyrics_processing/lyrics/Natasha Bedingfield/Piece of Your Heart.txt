I know you're tryna make me happy
And I know you're doing it you way, way
And I don't always make it easy
To know the perfect words to say, say

If you wanna give me what I want (Listen)
'Cause I'm gonna tell you what I need (So bad)
If you want to give me what I crave (Hold me)
So I can feel your love

When the craziness begins to get to me (Whoa)
Just need a hand to hold, just be that somebody (Whoa)
It's your tenderness that's gonna make it right
I wanna piece of your heart, not a piece of your mind
When the craziness begins to get to me (Whoa)
Just need a hand to hold, just be that somebody (Whoa)
It's your tenderness that's gonna make it right
Give me a piece of your heart, not a piece of your mind

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa

You're always tryna solve the puzzle
And you always wanna fix what's broke, broke
You keep searching through the rubble
And never wanna let it go, go

Sometimes it feels like I'm raining on the inside
And all the things that I'm tryin', I don't get it right
And sometimes, yeah, I fall, but I get up
It takes awhile, but I get there in my own time

If you wanna give me what I want, listen
'Cause I'm gonna tell you what I need, so bad
If you want to give me what I crave, hold me
So I can feel your love

When the craziness begins to get to me (Whoa)
Just need a hand to hold, just be that somebody (Whoa)
It's your tenderness that's gonna make it right
I wanna piece of your heart, not a piece of your mind
When the craziness begins to get to me (Oh, whoa)
Just need a hand to hold, just be that somebody (Yeah, whoa, oh)
It's your tenderness that's gonna make it right
Give me a piece of your heart, not a piece of your mind
Love is a very wide open door
You can go through every time you want more
Why do I feel like the glass is half full
When I've got enough of it to fill a swimming pool?

Listen
'Cause I'm gonna tell you what I need (So bad)
If you wanna give me what I crave (Hold me)
So I can feel your love

When the craziness begins to get to me (Whoa)
Just need a hand to hold, just be that somebody (Whoa)
It's your tenderness that's gonna make it right
I wanna piece of your heart, not a piece of your mind
When the craziness begins to get to me (Oh, whoa, oh)
Just need a hand to hold, just be that somebody (Whoa)
It's your tenderness that's gonna make it right
