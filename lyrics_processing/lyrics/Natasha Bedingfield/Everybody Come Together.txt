Well, I'm thinking 'bout the roles that we play
The life that we chase
Buried deep in mixed emotions
Love is always two steps away
But so is the pain
On this sunny afternoon

Yeah, we're walking without shoes on the sand
Hand in your hand
Sometimes, that's all that we can do, yeah
Makes no difference what we all say
Ooh, we can change
When everybody comes together
When everybody comes together

Yeah, we're drifting underneath the strobe light
Everything's alright
The whole world is invited
No one really wants to go home
And float on their own
Back where everything divides us

Yeah, we're walking without shoes on the sand
Hand in your hand
Sometimes, that's all that we can do, yeah
Makes no difference, what we all say
Ooh, we can change
When everybody comes together (Yeah)
When everybody comes together

Who the hell are we to say that the world
Can't be something better? Reach for each other
Gotta need someone, be someone, seas come together
We be dancing through the sands, ha, posing with our hands up
Make a difference, it would take one person to stand up
Yeah, and your thoughts'll change
When we already won 'cause our hearts the same

Yeah, we're walking without shoes on the sand
Hand in your hand (Hand in your hand)
Sometimes, that's all that we can do, yeah (All that we can do)
Makes no difference, what we all say
Ooh, we can change (Waiting on the world to change)
