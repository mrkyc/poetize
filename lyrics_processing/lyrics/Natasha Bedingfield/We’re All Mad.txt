I think the lady did protest too much
She wouldn't take the flower from my hand
She only saw the shadow of my circumstance
Perception can't describe what makes a man
I didn't mean to interrupt your stride
But a rose was all I had to give

Who's to point a finger at what's not understood?

Each reveals a meaning
We're all mad in our own way
Fill the sky with different shades
