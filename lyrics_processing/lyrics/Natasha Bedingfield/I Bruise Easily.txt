Oh-ooh-ooh, mmm, yeah

My skin is like a map
Of where my heart has been
And I can't hide the marks
But it's not a negative thing
So I let down my guard, drop my defenses down by my clothes
I'm learning to fall with no safety net to cushion the blow

I bruise easily, so be gentle when you handle me
There's a mark you leave
Like a love heart carved on a tree
I bruise easily
Can't scratch the surface without moving me
Underneath, I bruise easily
I bruise easily, yeah

I found your fingerprints
On a glass of wine
Do you know you're leaving them
All over this heart of mine too?
But if I never take this leap of faith, I'll never know
So I'm learning to fall with no safety net to cushion the blow
