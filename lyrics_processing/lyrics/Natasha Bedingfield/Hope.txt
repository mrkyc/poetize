Remember morning always comes
As night surrenders to the sun
No matter how dark it may become, yeah
Don't stop your light from shining on

'Cause nothing's ever over
'Til you say it's over
And nothing's ever finished
Not unless you walk away

You see, I got hope
So we can use a little, use a little even when you don't
And I won't let go
'Cause a little bit, a little bit of it can go a long, long way

Oh, oh, oh
I've got hope (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

It's easier to say you can't when you know you can, oh
It's easier to let go than to hold somebody's hand
But if you do, then you might just understand, yeah
That it's okay to not know where you're gonna land, yeah, yeah
