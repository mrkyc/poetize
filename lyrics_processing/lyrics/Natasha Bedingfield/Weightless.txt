I have to keep reminding myself
I'm not like anyone else
That's my face on my ID
That makes me VIP
No one exactly like this
No one with my fingerprints
No one can touch you like me
No, I can't fake what you see

They told me: "Girl, to get your way, you've gotta be a bitch!" (Nah)
They say: "A guy won't get the girl, if he's not filthy rich!"
You start with little changes 'til you don't know who you are
Surround yourself with friends who only call you superstar
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
(Ready, set, ready, let's go)

The sky is the limit and I just wanna float
Free as a spirit on a journey of hope
Cut the strings and let me go
I'm weightless (I'm weightless)
I'm weightless (I'm weightless)
Millions of balloons tethered to the ground
Weight of the world tries to hold us down
Cut the strings and let me go
I'm weightless, I'm weightless
I'm weightless (Yeah), I'm weightless
I'm weightless (Mmm)

All the things I held in my fist
If I don't let go, I don't exist
They've become the things that define me
How I look and the things to buy me
That's not important anymore
I feel me rising off the floor
Light as a feather, I'm carefree
I'm weightless

The sky is the limit and I just wanna float
Free as a spirit on a journey of hope
Cut the strings and let me go
I'm weightless (I'm weightless)
I'm weightless (I'm weightless)
Millions of balloons tethered to the ground (Tethered to the ground)
Weight of the world tries to hold us down
(The weight of the world tries to hold us down)
Cut the strings and let me go
I'm weightless (I'm weightless)
I'm weightless (I'm weightless)
(Oh, yeah) I'm weightless
(Oh, yeah) I'm weightless
(Oh, yeah) I'm weightless (Yeah)
La, la, la, la, la (Yeah)
They told me: "Girl, to get your way, you've got to be a bitch!" (Nah)

It seems to me that's so heavy and weighs you down like lead
Don't wanna be someone I hate
That don't make no sense

The sky is the limit and I just wanna float
Free as a spirit on a journey of hope
Cut the strings and let me go
I'm weightless, I'm weightless (Ready, set, ready, let's go)
The sky is the limit and I just wanna float
Free as a spirit on a journey of hope

Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
I'm free as a spirit
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
There's nothing holding me down (Oh, yeah)
Nothing holding me down
