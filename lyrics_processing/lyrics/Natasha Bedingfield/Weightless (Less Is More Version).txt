Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah

I have to keep reminding myself
I'm not like anyone else
That's my face on my ID
That makes me V.I.P
No one exactly like this
No one with my fingerprints
No one can touch you like me
No, I can't fake what you see

They told me: "Girl, to get your way, you've gotta be a bitch!"
They say: "A guy won't get the girl, if he's not filthy rich!"
You start with little changes 'til you don't know who you are
Surround yourself with friends who only call you a superstar
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)

The sky is the limit and I just wanna float
Free as a spirit on a journey of hope
Cut the strings and let me go
I'm weightless, I'm weightless
Millions of balloons tethered to the ground
Weight of the world tries to hold us down
Cut the strings and let me go
I'm weightless, I'm weightless
I'm weightless, I'm weightless
I'm weightless

All the things I hold in my fist
If I don't let go, I don't exist
They've become the things that define me
How I look and the things to buy me
That's not important anymore
I feel me rising off the floor
Light as a feather, I'm carefree
I'm weightless

The sky is the limit and I just wanna float
Free as a spirit on a journey of hope
Cut the strings and let me go
I'm weightless, I'm weightless
Millions of balloons tethered to the ground
Weight of the world tries to hold us down
Cut the strings and let me go
I'm weightless, I'm weightless
I'm weightless, I'm weightless
I'm weightless, I'm weightless
I'm weightless
They told me: "Girl, to get your way, you've got to be a bitch!"
They say: "A guy won't get the girl, if he's not filthy rich!"
It seems to me that's so heavy and weighs you down like lead
Don't wanna be someone I hate
'Cause that don't make no sense, no

The sky is the limit and I just wanna float
Free as a spirit on a journey of hope
Cut the strings and let me go
I'm weightless, I'm weightless
Millions of balloons tethered to the ground
Weight of the world tries to hold us down
Cut the strings and let me go
I'm weightless, I'm weightless
I'm weightless

Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
I'm weightless
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
I'm free as a spirit
