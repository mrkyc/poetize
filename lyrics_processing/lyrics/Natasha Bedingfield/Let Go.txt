Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey!

Foggy mornings, weekday grind
Take a minute to free your mind
Monday madness, Sunday's best
Let's go take a walk and catch our breath

Can't let the little things, get you down
The sun is shining, let's enjoy right now
No matter where we go, when we close our eyes
Know it'll be alright (alright)
Well dive through the ocean
And soar through the skies
Let go and enjoy the ride
Hey!

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
Let go and enjoy the ride

Waves are crashing
Sandy feet
Let our troubles wash out to sea
Climb a mountain, name a star
We are free to be who we are
You know it doesnt get better than this

No matter where we go, when we close our eyes
Know it'll be alright (alright)
We'll dive through the ocean
And soar through the skies
Let go and enjoy the ride (enjoy the ride)
Yeah!

No matter where we go, when we got our eyes closed

No matter where we go, when we got our eyes closed
We know we'll be alright, hey hey! (we know we'll be alright)
