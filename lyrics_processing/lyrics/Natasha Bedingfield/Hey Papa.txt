Kids and guns starting out so young
We normalize and empathize and hold our hands over our eyes
The breaking news, when I wake into
Turn it on, turn it off, pray to God one day it stops
What are we supposed to do
When everyone's afraid of changing?
How much do we have to lose?
Isn't all that we are worth saving?

So raise your hands and raise them high, ooh yeah
Hold them up and hold your fight, oh yeah

Hey Papa, what's the news?
Doesn't anybody wanna hear the truth?
Hey Papa, it's not fair
Seems like people going down everywhere

Hey Papa, oh hey

And we try to survive, oh, we'll live or we'll die
And we wanna be free, but we wanna be right
When I don't understand, I get angry sometimes
And we all want a piece of American dream
Red, white, and blue, freedom and peace
I don't know what it means 'cause it's far from our reach

Hey Papa, I give up
I don't know if I'm strong enough

Mamas mourn the loss in this world
And children pay the cost to live in this world

Hey Papa, what's the news? (What's the news?)
Doesn't anybody wanna hear the truth?
Hey Papa, it's not fair (It's not fair, it's not fair)
