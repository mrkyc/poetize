I was always searching for a reason
Never knew that taste of freedom
I knew that there was some more than just what I was seeing
But it was so hard to believe it

Then somehow you brought out a strength that was deep down
Let it out

Now I got my eyes open and wide
My heart burnin' like fire
Feels like I'm so alive
I'm never going back
Whatever I want now, I'm gonna chase
Who I am I can't contain it
I'm not gonna hold it in
'Cause there's more of me to give
There's more of me to give

I can feel the sunlight shining through me
Theres a beautiful world under my feet
It's all mine, its time to soak it all up
Full speed, can't keep it bottled up
Feel my spirit, let it run wild
