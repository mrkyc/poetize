I used to care so much about what others think about
I almost didn't have a thought of my own
The slightest remark would make me embark on a journey of self doubt
But that was a while ago
This girl has got stronger
And if I knew then what I know now
I would've told myself "Don't worry any longer"
It's okay

'Cause a face without freckles is like a sky without the stars
Why waste a second not loving who you are?
Those little imperfections make you beautiful, lovable, valuable
They show your personality inside your heart
Reflecting who you are

(Who you are, who you are, who you are)
Oh, yeah, yeah, uh

I wondered if I could trade my body with somebody else in magazines
Would the whole world fall at my feet?
I felt unworthy and would blame my failures on the ugliness I could see
When the mirror looked at me (Sometimes I feel)
Sometimes I still feel like that little girl who doesn't belong in her own world
But I'm get it better by reminding myself (Yeah)
