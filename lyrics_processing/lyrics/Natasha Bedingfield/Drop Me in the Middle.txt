Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Yeah, something different, Tasha, Estelle
Come on, uh
UK, stand up for this
You know what, the world stand up for this
This, come on, Tash, sing it

I think I found the recipe for creativity
Put all you've got, then add some heart
They fence us in to break us down
But still, they can't shut us down
The walls are thin
But still, they're strong
We're broken, but we beat as one

From the UK to your street (London blood)
Saying nothin' ain't different under the sun
So I'm'a become somethin' like a ripple in the sea
Cause I wanna be
Where it's happening, oh

Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple effect
Upon the ocean, I'll be the moon that turns the tide
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple
A domino effect, falling through the sands of time

Da-da-da, oh, da-da-da, oh

Think I'll change the temperature
'Til it's the right weather
Here in the core, it's getting warm
Too many channels, nothing on
To turn it off, it just takes one

From the UK to your street (London blood)
Saying nothin' ain't different under the sun
So I'm'a become somethin' like a ripple in the sea
Cause I wanna be
Where it's happening, oh

Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple effect
Upon the ocean, I'll be the moon that turns the tide
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple
A domino effect, falling through the sands of time

Da-da-da, oh, da-da-da, oh
(Sing it, 'tash, come on)
Da-da-da, oh, da-da-da, oh
Put me in the middle, let me start the drama
Said I'm trying to do this 'cause it affects my karma
Listen, no one expected us to do this
Well, so I know we're making best without any time to dwell
Said I'm trying to make a stand for my family name
I got my piece of gold and I had it engraved
It's more than a chain, more than hearing what they say
I'm trying to go, be global, be out in space
Try to do it at a pace, but I got a little sick of it
Robbin' me hot and lukewarm a little bit
In my two feet two-stepping in my Timbo's
Anyone in my way's getting moved out the window
I have to represent my Mama my Nanny like Laila Ali
I need your daddy every time she fight
I'm trying to live my dreams 'stead of watching them flow
You'll be just another memory

Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple effect
Upon the ocean, I'll be the moon that turns the tide
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple
A domino effect, falling through the sands of time
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple effect
Upon the ocean, I'll be the moon that turns the tide
Drop me in the middle so I can make a ripple effect
A domino effect, falling through the sands of time
Drop me in the middle
Drop me in the middle
