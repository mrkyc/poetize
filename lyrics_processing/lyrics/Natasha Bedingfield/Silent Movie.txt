Yeah, yeah, yeah

We're in a picture black and white
You took the light out of my life
When you gave in
We're playing out our different roles
We should be wanting the same goals
Listening, forgiving

Oh, why can't we communicate
When the main feature is just beginning?

In this silent movie
There's no talking
You're just an actor
So, break into my story
Take it over
Paint me with colour

Everybody's speaking, but you don't know what they're saying
You're just guessing meanings
Interpreting emotion through a window that is broken
We're just testing feelings

So, break into my story
Take it over

Step into the movie, you can be my leading man
Break into the silence, so your heart can understand
Step into the movie, we can walk along the sand (Walk along)
Let me stand beside you, put your life into my hands (Woo!)

Don't you know you love me, like you never loved yourself?
(Step into the movie, you can be my leading man)
(Like you never loved yourself)
Don't you know you love me, like you never loved yourself? (Wo-hoo)
(Break into the silence, so your heart can understand)
