Just like a shadow
I'll be beside you
I'll be your comfort
I'm there to guide you home
I will provide you a place of shelter
I wanna be your zone

I'll act as if you do (Do)
Tell me what you wanted me to do (Do)
I'll make you great to be a man
With a woman who can stand
On every promise given
Making vows to please her man
Ooh, whoa, oh

If I could be your angel (Your angel, your angel)
Protect you from the pain (From the pain, oh)
I'll keep you safe from danger (From danger, from danger)
You'll never hurt again (No more)

Yeah, A-N-G-E-L
Hey, A-N-G-E-L
