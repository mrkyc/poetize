I'm in like with you
Not in love with you, quite yet
My heart's beginning to
Slightly overrule my head

Oh-no, oh-no
My self-control
It won't hold up
For very long
Oh-no, oh-no
You touch my soul
I can't help falling too fast for you

Can you hold on a bit?
Stop before we go
'Cause I might need a moment
And I wouldn't wanna spoil it
Who knows
If I am
Ready or not? (Ready or not)
Only time will tell
Who knows
If we are
Ready to make this something
Who knows?
Mmm, yeah
