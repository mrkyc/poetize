Standing still, but still moving
Lying down, but not resting
Breathing air, suffocating
All the while, I'm debating
Life was never what I thought
Never what I wanted it to be
Had a plan, couldn't follow
Had a dream, it was hollow
Everywhere felt like nowhere
Everything was so boring
Life was never what I wanted
Never what I thought
Until you came and turned it all around

Oh, you found the peace of me
It was missing; it was broken
You put soul into it
Oh, you found the whole of me
I was empty, now I'm better
All my peace is back together

Restless ways for a living
Fitting in 'cause I was driven
Saying "Yes", when I meant "No"
Holding on, should've let go
I was scattered all around
Left shattered on the ground
You picked me up
All I wanted was a little bit of hope
Couldn't find it
You showed me something that I never knew I owned
You put a light to it

Oh, you found the peace of me
It was missing; it was broken
You put soul into it
Oh, you found the whole of me
I was empty, now I'm better
'Cause you pieced me back together

What a life, always tried
What a life, lived without you
Don't leave me, and I won't fall apart
I won't leave you
And it's cold and I'm blind
And I would and it feels good
What a waste of my mind
Every time, all the time

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, you found the whole of me
It was missing; it was broken
You put it back together
Oh, you've found the whole of me (Haha, yeah, oh)
I was empty, now I'm better
