Ooh, oh (Talk to 'em, babe)
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Never find a love like this
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Hey, let's go)
Never find a love like this (Ooh, oh)

Well, we go back so far, swinging in your backyard, all the things that we used to do
We were cool back in high school, ooh, I really liked you, must've been your attitude

And that's why you keep on running in and out of my mind
As the years, they all roll by, baby, now I know why I keep coming back to you (Skrr)

You're the only one that knows me, love it when you hold me, never find a love like this (Let me hear you say)
Now I'll never be lonely, look at what you've shown me, never find a love like this
Well, this life tried to keep us apart
You keep calling me back to your heart
Let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me, wrap your world around me (Yeah), never find a love like this (Love like this)

All the guys tried to take me, you're the one who saved me, I feel like I owe you my life (Oh, owe you my life)
And as strange as it may seem, I'll go if you take me, I'm willing to sacrifice

For you not to leave me now (Let's go)
