I got a short attention span
Can't sit around couch potato land
I wanna do all kinds of stuff
Talking about it's not enough, no
I wanna go to the extreme
I wanna stretch my limousine
I wanna take it way off road
Go where I'm not supposed to go

Life is music, play it louder

If you're gonna jump, then jump far
Fly like a sky diver
If you're gonna be a singer, then you better be a rockstar
If you're gonna be a driver, then you better drive a race car
'Cause I'm looking for a guard dog, not buyin' a Chihuahua, ah

I like my food with chili in
I like to laugh 'til it's hurtin'
I wanna stare fear in the face
I wanna take it all the way

'Cause I'm looking for a guard dog, not buyin' a Chihuahua
If you're gonna jump, if you're gonna jump, then jump far
If you wanna hit the high notes, then you gotta be a diva
If you're gonna play a guitar, you gotta play 'til you blister
'Cause I'm looking for a guard dog, not buyin' a Chihuahua
(Not buyin' a Chihuahua)

No half-baked apples for my tea
It's hot or cold, no in-between
If your gonna jump (Oh)

If you're gonna jump, then jump far
Fly like a sky diver (If you're gonna)
