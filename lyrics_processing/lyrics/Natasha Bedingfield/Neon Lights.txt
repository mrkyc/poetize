Every day there's a thousand things that somehow pass us by
Go cut through the noise so you can know what love sounds like
I'm gonna tune to your frequency to 106 point me
So there's no distractions

Take a breath, take it in
Love has no expiration date
My heart will always beat for you at a constant rate, uh
It will outlast everything you think is set is stone
It goes on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on

Buzzing like
Neon lights
Can you feel my love? Loud and clear
Pulls you near
Can you feel my love?
We got all the memories
So much more we can see
Better than our first kiss
Snow falling at Christmas
Like sleeping in on Sunday
Laughter we never fake
Bob Marley in summer
One love for each other
Oh, it feels like
Fireflies
Day and night
Can you feel my love?

Everyone is looking for a special connection, ha
But it's like your compass points a million directions (Oh)
Do you need me to buy you a telescope so you can see?
How good this could be, oh

Buzzing like
Neon lights
Can you feel my love? Loud and clear
Pulls you near
Can you feel my love?
Oh, we got all the memories
So much more we can see
Better than our first kiss
Snow falling at Christmas
Like sleeping in on Sunday
Laughter we never fake
Bob Marley in summer
One love for each other
Oh, it feels like
Fireflies (Can you feel it?)
Day and night
Can you feel my love? (Can you feel it?)

And I'll wait for you
As long as it takes
Until I get through
And it hits you right in the face
Can you feel my love?
Can you feel my love?
We got all the memories
So much more we can see
Better than our first kiss
Snow falling at Christmas
Like sleeping in on Sunday (Can you feel my love?)
Laughter we never fake
Bob Marley in summer
One love for each other
Oh, it feels like (One love for each other)
One love for each other
Can you feel my love?

Buzzing like (Fireflies)
Neon lights (Day and night)
Can you feel my love?
Fireflies
Day and night
