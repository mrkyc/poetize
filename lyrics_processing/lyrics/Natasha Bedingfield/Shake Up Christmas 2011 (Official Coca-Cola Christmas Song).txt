There's a story that I was told
I wanna tell the world before I get too old
And don't remember it, so let's December it
And reassemble it, oh yeah
Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To fill the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list (Yeah!)

Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on, yeah
It's Christmas time

Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on, yeah

At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say:
"I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground and my family above
Can you send some happiness with my best
To the rest of the people of the East and the West
And maybe every once in a while
You can just give my grandma a smile
'Tis the season to smile
It's cold, but I'm freezing in style
Let me meet a boy one day, yeah
That wants to spread some love this way, yeah
We can let our souls run free, yeah
And he can open some happiness with me"

Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on, yeah
It's Christmas time
Shake it up
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on, yeah
It's Christmas time
I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where your boots have been
I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
Your love will grow and they believe again

Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on, yeah
