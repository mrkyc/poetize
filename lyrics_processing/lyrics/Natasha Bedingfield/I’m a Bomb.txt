Yeah, yeah, oh, whoa
Oh-oh

Taxi ride, going downtown
Me and my girls, going out
Counting down to detonation
Ten to zero, mushroom cloud
Little angel, I've been too good (I've been too good)
Ditch the halo for a while
Dressed to kill
I'll be causing mass distraction
So shield your eyes

I'm all steamed up
And I'm ready to blow
The pressure max
Meter red overload
To get release
I gotta explode, explode

I'm a bomb
Can you hear me tick?
Beware if you turn me on, there is no safety switch
I'm a bomb, use only steady hands
To mess with me, you must be a brave man
I'm a bomb (I'm a bomb, yeah)
Bomb, bomb, bomb
I'm a bomb (hey, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb)

Bass so loud, I can't hear you
Can't defuse me, now I'm wired
Do not disturb while I'm dancing
Watch me set this house on fire
Yeah, yeah (Woo!)

I'm a bomb (I'm a bomb)
Can you hear me tick?
Beware if you turn me on, there is no safety switch (No, no, no)
I'm a bomb (Yeah), use only steady hands
To mess with me (Uh), you must be a brave man
I'm a bomb (Yeah, yeah)
(Bomb, bomb, bomb)
Can you hear me tick? (Hear me tick, tick)
Beware if you turn me on (Whoa), there is no safety switch
I'm a bomb (Bomb, bomb, bomb)
Use only steady hands
To mess with me, you must be a brave man

Club crescendo, getting loud
Run for cover, underground
What are you doing?
Showing me no fear
You must be crazy hanging 'round here
I'm all steamed up
And I'm ready to blow
The pressure max
Meter red overload
To get release
I gotta explode, explode

I'm a bomb
Can you hear me tick?
Beware if you turn me on, there is no safety switch
I'm a bomb, use only steady hands
To mess with me, you must be a brave man
(you must be a brave man)
I'm a bomb (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can you hear me tick?
Beware if you turn me on, there is no safety switch
I'm a bomb (Yeah)
Use steady hands
To mess with me, you must be a brave man

I'm a bomb (Bomb)
I'm a bomb (Bomb)
I'm a bomb (Bomb)
I'm a bomb (Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb)
