Da, da da...
Uh, yeah
Da, da da...

I've been sizin' you up and stuff
Watchin' you live life large
Big enough for the both of us to big up the love
Got the measure of the man in you
It's more than the sum of the parts
It's true what they say
You gotta big up the love
I was checkin' nice things you do
Standing in the Starbucks queue
You buy coffee for a stranger who's down on their luck
Random acts of kindness flow (Flow)
Compassion from a hand I'd like to hold (Hold)
It does it for me and I can't get enough

(Oh) Don't confuse me when I say
(Oh) Please don't take this the wrong way
You can lead a heart to love
But you can't make it fall
I'm tired of loving small
'Cause...

Size matters (Size matters), but not how you think
I'm talking 'bout your heart
And what you do with it
The more seeds you plant, the more flowers will grow
So, big up the love
'Til it overflows

Most blokes too shallow to swim in
Only interested in one thing
It's all so meaningless
'Cause puddles dry up (Yeah, up)
A view of the world so small it limits
It limits the size of the dream and you achieving it
(A new panorama) A new panorama with your arms around me
I see my life, how it should be

You can lead a heart to love
But you can't make it fall
I'm tired of loving small
'Cause...

Size matters (Size matters), but not how you think
I'm talking 'bout your heart
And what you do with it
The more seeds you plant, the more flowers will grow
So, big up the love
'Til it overflows
(Big up the love) Big up the love
Big up the love
Till it overflows
Big it up, big it up (Big it up, big it up)
Big it up, big it up (Yeah)
When size matters
Big it up, big it up  (Big up the love)
Big it up, big it up
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

You can lead a heart to love
But you can't make it fall
I'm tired of loving small

It's the little things you do
That show me how big you are
So, big up the love
