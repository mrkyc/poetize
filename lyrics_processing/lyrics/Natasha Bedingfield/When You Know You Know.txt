You taught me a lesson about love today
Oh-oh, yeah, mmm

Love is not a castle in the clouds
'Cause when there's a storm, it'll all come crashing down
I'd rather find it like a penny on the ground
'Cause that's something I can keep and carry around
Truth is not a feather blowin' 'round in the wind
It's that jump in your heart, goosebumps on your skin
Just pinch me if it's really happening
'Cause I'm more awake than I've ever been
And you're the one from my dream

You're out of my mind
And into my heart
You're more than a feeling
More than I could have thought
I can't deny, I can't say love never comes
All I know is, when you know, you know

And I just know
That love has come in the form of you (Yeah)
If someone put me on a witness stand
I'd point to you, as hardcore evidence
You're proof that you don't have to understand
You can still fall into the right hands
You're the one in my dreams

More than I could have thought
I can't deny, I can't say love never comes
All I know is, when you know, you know

I was a doubter
A typical, won't believe 'til I see
Oh, so grounded, to think that someone like you
Couldn't be right in front of me

You're out of my mind
And into my heart (Right in front of me, oh)
You're more than a feeling
More than I could have thought
I can't deny, I can't say love never comes
All I know is, when you know, you know
You're out of my mind (You're out of my mind)

You're more than a feeling (More than a feeling)
More than I could have thought
I can't deny, I can't say love never comes (Can't deny, no)
