Oh-oh, yeah

I feel these four walls closin' in
Face up against the glass
I'm lookin' out, mmm
Is this my life, I'm wonderin'
It happened so fast
How do I turn this thing around?
Is this the bed I chose to make?
There's greener pastures I'm thinkin' about, mmm
Wide open spaces far away

All I want is the wind in my hair
To face the fear but not feel scared

Wild horses, I wanna be like you
Throwing caution to the wind, I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love like I'm longing to
I wanna run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses, oh
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah

I see the girl I wanna be
Riding bareback, carefree along the shore
If only that someone was me
Jumping headfirst, headlong without a thought
To act and damn the consequence
How I wish it could be that easy
But fear surrounds me like a fence
I wanna break free

All I want is the wind in my hair
To face the fear but not feel scared, oh

Wild horses, I wanna be like you
Throwing caution to the wind, I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love like I'm longing to
I wanna run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses
I wanna run too, oh

Recklessly abandoning myself before you
I wanna open up my heart
Tell him how I feel
Oh, wild horses, I wanna be like you
Throwing caution to the wind, I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love like I'm longing to
I wanna run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses, oh
Yeah, yeah, oh, mmm

I wanna run with the wild horses
