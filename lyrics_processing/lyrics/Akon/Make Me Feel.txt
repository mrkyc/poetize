Easy as that?
Thought I'd take her home and
Bring her right back, bro
I felt for her
I felt

I was like, two-seater, "Hello, can I meet her?"
Know that she was gold from the first time I've seen her
I was like, Mamacita
Cooler than a freezer
Come and pop that body right here on me, no meter

She was there right, wasn't hard to read her
In the middle of the night, watch out with Khalifa
Then I saw that apple bum, it was bigger than Vanita'
I never leave a man down, had to go retrieve her

You say that we may be the one
We love hard and fight like we're done
But you know how to make me feel
You know how to make me feel
Can't lose you, this thing ain't no lie
While you mine forever will try
But you know how to make me feel
You know how to make me feel
(Sexy, sexy)
