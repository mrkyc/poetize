Konvict, Konvict
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Go gangsta
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Go gangsta, keep boppin' (Block Boy up)
Rock with me, let's get this bitch poppin' (Upfront)
Go gangsta, keep boppin' (Geah)
Like back when a nigga was clockin'

See nowadays it seems like everybody wanna be killers
Gorillas gettin' high off their weed and liquor
You die quicker, paramedics drive back slow to the hospital
You get pronounced dead at 4 to the hospital
Stop frontin' when you know you won't pull nothin'
First nigga to retreat when the tools bustin'
Playin' with death is bad for your health
All your homeboys gone, you the last one left
Now, they hearts beatin' but these niggas be scared
The real ones are all locked up or dead
Nowadays you can't find a good connect
But if you do, you might be the feds, so

I don't know you, you don't know me
You don't know the history I got on these streets
Only if you see what my eyes have seen
Then you'll understand why I'm surrounded by G's
If you owe me or we got beef
I recommend you reach for your heat and don't freeze
Pause for a minute, guarantee you gon' bleed
'Cause that's how we was raised growin' up in these streets

Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Rock with me, let's get this bitch poppin'
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Like back when a nigga was clockin'

See it's hard to be good but easy to do evil
And I ain't really into meetin' with new people
Just put the money in the bag and I'll leave you
The weed, coke, Lambo or Evisu
You make a hundred dollars, to the streets you made a G
When you coppin' O's, they swearin' you move ki's
Feds gettin' close and the rats seein' cheese
And they tryna find them birds, not the ones that sleep in trees
We got that bird, we got that blue
You want short skirts? We got that too
Whatever you need, my nigga, show me the cheese
And baby, you can believe that we can make that brew

I don't know you, you don't know me
You don't know the history I got on these streets
Only if you see what my eyes have seen
Then you'll understand why I'm surrounded by G's
If you owe me or we got beef
I recommend you reach for your heat and don't freeze
Pause for a minute, guarantee you gon' bleed
'Cause that's how we was raised growin' up in these streets
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Rock with me, let's get this bitch poppin'
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Like back when a nigga was clockin'

Streets been watchin' and they don't blink
Sidewalk got ears, the pavement don't sleep
The fittest will survive, the weak just don't eat
Everybody in between just gettin' a rap sheet
The streets been watchin' and they don't blink
