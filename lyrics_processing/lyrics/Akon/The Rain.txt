Ah-ah-ah-ahh, ah-ah-ah-ahh
Konvict music, yeah

The pressure's buildin' up (Oh), I feel like givin' up (Oh)
How in the fuck am I gonna back my first album up?
When everything has changed (Oh), it'll never be the same (Oh)
Nobody knew me then, now everybody knows my name
And I feel so ashamed
I never been the kind of nigga that would complain
But it's so crazy, man
It's no different, every day, it's just the same thing
Now it's been months out on the road
On tour doin' so many different shows
Head spinnin', feelin' like it's gonna explode
And I just wanna know
If anybody out there's feelin me
I'm losin my mind and I can't believe
I let this shit get the best of me
And now I gotta let you know

What's got me insane?
Ohh, 'cause I can't stand the rain
Ayy, it's hitting my window pane a little too much
And now I gotta let you know
What's got my face in a frown?
Ayy, 'cause I can't stand the sound (Can't stand the sound)
Ohh, the thunder that's crashing down upon my house (Ayy)
'Cause now I gotta let you know
See Akon LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like
Now I got no more worries now (Now), my pocket's fatter now (Now)
Look in the mirror, my reflection looks different now
You're gettin' bigger, Akon, you need to settle down
Why do I feel this way?
Should I be happy or should I just ignore
Everything that I've been given? Please help me Lord
It's all over, but I can't escape the rain
Now it's been months out on the road
On tour doin' so many different shows
Head spinnin', feelin' like it's gonna explode
And now I gotta let you know
If anybody out there's feelin me
I'm losin my mind and I can't believe
I let this shit get the best of me
And now I gotta let you know

What's got me insane?
Ohh, 'cause I can't stand the rain (Can't stand it)
Ayy, it's hitting my window pane (Can't stand it), a little too much
That's why I gotta let you know
What's got my face in a frown? (Yeah)
Ayy, 'cause I can't stand the sound (Can't stand the sound)
Ohh, the thunder that's crashing down (That's crashing down), upon my house
