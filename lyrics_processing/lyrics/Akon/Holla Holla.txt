Girl you need to quit it

So many girls outside

And I know you a sex machine
And I wanna do summin' new to you
The way you roll them thighs
And your girl doin' it too
If you want we can mix it up
I could set it up, she can get it too
We got plenty of drinks', plenty plenty of water
We got plenty of things comin' from Cal-ifornia
And we all got that bank so believe we can afford this
So stop, playin' and show me what you can do
And don't be actin' like that (like that) I know you wanna ride
Cause my Lamborghini doors go up and down
Now all these gorillas' here, all these women here
Somebody here gon' fuck
