Yo, excuse me, beg your pardon, girl
Do you have any idea what you starting, girl?
You got me tingiling, come to me mingiling
Steppin off lookin' bootylicious and jingiling
When you walk, I see it baby girl
When you talk, I believe it baby girl
I like that, thick-petite n' pretty
Little touch is a ditty
Love to work the kitty like "purrrr"
She loves to stir it up (Purrr)
I can hear her purring up
Cause she's the type that'll get arousy of
Get you excited and call her boyfriend up (Ohh)
What's the man without the plan B
We can meet up at the hutter house for the TV
So stand by like a butty pass
While I watch this beautiful thing shake that ass
See Akon LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like

Girl, I must say you the flyest thang in here
So hot we gon' need some rain in here
Type to make ex-gangstas bang in here
Girl, you could do anything you want in here
Clown if you want to, frown if you want to
You ain't even gotta drop down if you want to
'Cause I'd rather see you shake it standin'
Either way you do it girl, you look outstandin' (Uhhuuuhh)
And now you got me spending (Uhhuuhhh)
The way you got that body bendin' (Uhhhuhh)
An ass like that girl, you gotta be kickin'
And we goin' to church next day repentant
Lap dancing for my FA crew
Slide it ova to Bu cause he wants some too
Up in the VIP with no fee
Blessing you with the G even tho we gettin' it free, so

After the party party
Grab a hottie hottie
In the back seat of your Maserati-rati
Jiggle jiggle it to the left (Ah ah ah)
Jiggle jiggle it to the right (Ah ah ah)
Jiggle it to the front, then jiggle it to the back
And jiggle jiggle it all all night (Ah ah ah)
