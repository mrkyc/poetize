So soft and slow
Never knew, a girl could be so goddamn cold
I know the way she move got me spendin' my dough, and yo
If you would have seen what I seen on that pole, just know

That I was wrong for fallin' in love (love)
I was wrong for fallin' in love (they always said don't love a ho)
Said I was wrong for fallin' in love (love, don't do it yo)
I was wrong for fallin in love (they always said don't love a ho)
But I just went against the grain

It was a feelin' I can't explain, and it felt like harmony
Singin in my face like dee-dee-da-di-do-da-de
I don't want it to ever go away
I want it around me everyday
Singin in my face like dee-dee-da-di-do-da-de

Look at me, I'm stuck
The bubble in her pants got me caught up, I never had no luck
Thinkin with the wrong head got me jumpin' out there with no glove
It feels so good, had me sprung out on that stuff, now I'm stuck

So thick, so raw
That oil all over her body stole my heart, I'm cold
The way she dropped down won't allow me to close my jaw, cause I'm
Already in love and I knew better from the start, oh no
