You got a sex siren in your face
Let me get up on it, let me get up on it, let me get up on it
Talk dirty to me, babe, every time I want it
Every time I want it, every time I want it, every time I want it

Hush, please, no more games
No more of the same thing
Been thinking maybe could he
Make me scream his name and give me the right aim
Boy, can you tame these goodies?

Baby, make me tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, boom
Tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik
Baby, make me tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, boom
Not too slow, not too quick
Baby, make me tik, tik boom
Tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik boom
Tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik
Baby, make me tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, boom
Not too slow, not too quick
Baby, make me tik, tik boom

Shut your mouth, lock it up
Why you wanna flaunt it?
Why you wanna flaunt it?
Why you wanna flaunt it?
Your turn, switch it up
Let me get up on it, let me get up on it, let me get up on it

Turn it
Come here for a minute, let me taste you, baby
Light your fuel detonate you, baby
Got my brain have you going insane
My dynamite stick known to drive shit crazy, baby
I want you laying up in the bed with your feet up
Right there in my wife beater
She like the way I eat her, beat her, beat her
Treat her like an animal somebody call PETA
Put a little bit of this inside a margarita
Then put your thing have you running like a meter
On a cab in the city, where the girls are pretty
Find me in the club, where the girls get busy
With a flat stomach, fat booty, nice shaped titties
My wrist so froze you could ice skate with it
Give it to you til you curl your toes
Get your ass out your clothes, sit back and behold the explosion
Baby, make me tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, boom
Tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik
Baby, make me tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, boom
Not too slow, not too quick
Baby, make me tik, tik boom
Tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik boom
Tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik
Baby, make me tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, boom
Not too slow, not too quick
