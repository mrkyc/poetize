Break it up, break it down
See me comin' you can hear my sound
Tell somebody in your town
Spread the word, spread the word
Go call the police
Go call the governor
I bring the treble
Don't mean to trouble ya
I make it bubble up
Call me the bubbler
I am the bad bitch
The bitch that you're lovin' up

Hold your head high
Fingers to the sky
They gon' try and try ya, but they can't deny ya
Keep it moving higher, and higher
Keep it moving higher, and higher
So hold your head high
Fingers to the sky
Now they don't believe ya, but they gonna need ya
Keep it moving higher and higher
Keep it moving higher and higher and higher
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work it out, work it out, work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out, work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out, work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out

You better work bitch
