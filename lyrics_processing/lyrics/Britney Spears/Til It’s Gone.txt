I'm blind from the tears that fall like rain
So lost, ever since you went away
Sometimes our lives forever change
My heart's never gonna be the same

'Cause you came and you gave me a place
Place to lay all my pain
Why'd you take it away?

You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never, you never, you never, you never
You never know what you got 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
'Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone

I try every night, to turn the page
But daylight can't confine me to a cage
In my mind, the life we had replays
Now everywhere, I turn I see your face
You might also like
'Cause you came and you gave me a place
Place to lay all my pain
Why'd you take it away?

You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never, you never, you never, you never
You never know what you got 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
'Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's, 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
'Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone

All the memories, I'm saving
So your love is never fading
Holding on my heart is breaking
Can't let go

You never know what you got 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
'Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's, 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
'Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's, 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
'Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's
