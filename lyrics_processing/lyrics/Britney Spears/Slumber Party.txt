I think I see confetti from this potion
Pillow fights and feathers, overdosin'
Smells like a cologne and candy lotion
Like a slumber party
Sheets all on the floor just like an ocean
Building up your fortress like a mountain
Neighbors say we're causing a commotion
Like a slumber party

No one but, no one but you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonigh-igh-ight
Oh baby, no one but, no one but you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonight

'Cause we got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go
Go crazy, go
Like a slumber party
Like a slumber party
Like a slumber party

Let's fill up this clawfoot bath with bubbles
Loving me so hard it's causing trouble
If there's seven minutes in heaven make it double, triple
Like a slumber party

No one but, no one but you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonigh-igh-ight
Oh baby, no one but, no one but you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonight

'Cause we got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go
Go crazy, go
Like a slumber party
We got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go
(Crazy, go) Go crazy, go
Like a slumber party
(I go fucking crazy)
Like a slumber party
A slumber party, yeah
Like a slumber party
No one but, no one but you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonight
Like a slumber party

We got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos (our own videos)
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go
Go crazy, go
Like a slumber party
We got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go
(Go crazy, yeah) Go crazy, go
Like a slumber party (a slumber party)
Like a slumber party (I go crazy for you)
