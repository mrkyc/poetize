They ain't nothin' in this world that I don't know
I saw Old King Pharaoh's daughter find Little Moses on the water
And I can whip the man that says it isn't so
I saw Noah when he built that famous ark
I slipped into it one night when it got dark
I saw Jonah swallowed by the whale, and I pulled the lion's tail
I can whip the man that says it isn't so
I'm an educated man, to get more sense within my head I plan
Well, I've been on earth so long, and I used to sing a little song
While all of them old timers took their stand
Queen Elizabeth fell dead in love with me, (hee, hee, she did)
We was married in Milwaukee secretly
Then I took her out and shook her, and I went with General Hooker
To fight mosquitoes down in Tennessee
I taught Solomon his little A B C's (smart feller)
And through all his books, I tutored him with ease
Then I sailed out on the bay with Methuselah one day
And I played with his flowing whiskers in the breeze
I'm an educated man, to get more sense within my head I plan

I seen old Satan when he searched that Garden o'er, (old booger)
Saw Adam and Eve driven from the door
When the applese they were eating, from the bushes I was a-peeping
I can prove it from the man that ate the core
I saw Cain when he killed Abel with a spade
And I know the game was poker that they played
I was hid behind the shrub when he slapped him with that club
Poor old Abel caught him a-cheatin', and now he's dead
I'm an educated man, to get more sense within my head I plan
Well, I've been on earth so long, and I used to sing a little song
