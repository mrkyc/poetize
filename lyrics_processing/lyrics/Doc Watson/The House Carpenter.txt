We've met, we've met, said he
I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
And it's all for the love of thee
I could have married the King's daughter fair
She would have married me
But I've forsaken her crown of gold
And it's all for the love of thee
Come in, come in, my old true love
Come in, she said to him
For it's been three fourths of a long, long year
Since together we have been
No, I can't come in, nor I can't sit down
For I have but a moment's time
And they say that you're married to a house carpenter
And your heart will never be mine
Will you come with me, my old true love?
Oh come with me, said he
And I'll take you to where the grass grows green
On the banks of Bittery
Then she picked up her sweet little babe
And kisses she gave it three
Sayin', stay at home my darlin' little babe
And keep your papa company
You might also likeThen he jumped on a milk white steppe
And her on a dapple grey
They rode until they came to the banks of a sea
Three hours before the break of day
They had not been on the ship two weeks
I'm sure it was not three
Until his true love began to weep and to mourn
And she wept most bitterly
Oh, is it for my silver you weep?
Is it for my store?
Or is it for that house carpenter
Whose face you'll never see no more?
It's neither for you silver I weep
And neither for your store
But it's all for the sake of my sweet little babe
Whose face I'll never see no more
Then a curse, a curse to the sailor she cried
A curse, a curse, she swore
You've robbed me of my house carpenter
Whose face I'll never see no more
They had not been on the ship three weeks
I'm sure it was not four
Till they sprang a leak in the bottom of the ship
