I didn't mean it one bit
But if I could take it back
I'd have already done that
I'm sorry it went like this
'Cause some days I still miss you
But tomorrow it will pass
At least I'm telling myself that
At least I tell myself (That's fine)
At least I tell myself it's not your fault
I bet too much and lost it all
At least I tell myself you're better off
I just had to figure out how to stop
I wish you'd felt the same
But I'm not bitter about it
I swear I'm better without it
By now I'm on a better track
Despite my fucked up past
If I'd had time to explain
What was going on in my brain
Maybe we'd have never cracked
At least I was telling myself that
At least I tell myself it's not your fault
I bet too much and lost it all
At least I tell myself you're better off
I just had to figure out how to stop

It's ok if you hate me
