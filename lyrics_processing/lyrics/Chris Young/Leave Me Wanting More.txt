I know it's seven o' clock
I know I've already got a dinner reservation set for two
We made a plan to go out, but all I'm thinking  about is me laying
Right here beside you
So if you change your mind and tell me that you wanna stay
At home instead of going, you know what I'm gonna say
As long as I got your eyes staring back into mine
I got everything that I need

We don't gotta leave this room
You don't have to get dressed up for me tonight
Girl, to get me staring at you
You look good in any light
You're gonna leave me breathless
Even if we never walk out that door
We don't gotta leave this room
For you to leave me wanting more (for you to leave me wanting more)

Wanting more of your kiss landing right on my lips
Leaning right into me, skin on skin
Wanting more of just of us falling deeper in love
Over and over again

We don't gotta leave this room
You don't have to get dressed up for me tonight
Girl, to get me staring at you
You look good in any light
You're gonna leave me breathless
Even if we never walk out that door
We don't gotta leave this room
For you to leave me wanting more
For you to leave me wanting more

So, when you pull me close and tell me that you wanna stay
At home with me, girl, everytime you know I'm gonna stay

We don't gotta leave this room
You don't have to get dressed up for me tonight
Girl, to get me staring at you
You look good in any light
You're gonna leave me breathless
Even if we never walk out that door
We don't gotta leave this room
For you to leave me wanting more
