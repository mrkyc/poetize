I see you're doin' well
Well, I'm not
Got someone new in your life
Well, I don't
I've been busy wantin' you back
And you've been busy movin' on way too fast
Guess my heart's takin' the long way out
It don't even know what to do
And seein' you with him tonight
I guess I don't break like you

I don't drink like you do, I can't just have one
'Cause I'm still drinkin' 'bout us, so I'll probably get drunk
Wish I could laugh and dance on a Saturday night
Like you do, like goodbye ain't even crossin' your mind
Maybe you're just good at gettin' gone
Or I'm just really bad at movin' on
I'm still in love, girl, it's true
What can I say?
I hate that I don't break like you do

I wish I could just smile, say hello
Show you I'm doin' fine, but I won't
'Cause I can't fake it through
Damnit, I don't break like you

I hate that I don't break like you do, oh

I don't drink like you do, I can't just have one
So, I'll just sit right here, keep drinkin' 'bout us
I wish I could laugh, wish I could dance
But, baby, I just can't

I don't drink like you do, I can't just have one
'Cause I'm still drinkin' 'bout us, so I'll probably get drunk
Wish I could laugh and dance on a Saturday night
Like you do, like goodbye ain't even crossin' your mind
Maybe you're just good at gettin' gone
Or I'm just really bad at movin' on
I'm still in love, girl, it's true (I'm still in love, it's true)
What can I say?
I hate that I don't break like you do
