It's better than sippin' something strong
The way my name rolls off your tongue
The way the light, it hits your eyes, and makes me come alive
It moves me more than any song
When you got that shade of lipstick on
Across the room or by my side

Baby, I can feel my heartbeat, heartbeat
Pound in my chest
You in that dress
Makin' it jump like a kick drum on repeat (On repeat)
I love the way you make my heartbeat, heartbeat
There's no mistakin'
Right now it's racin'
Every time that you get close to me (Close to me)
Baby, I can feel my heartbeat

You make me feel like I could fly
Like some old rollercoaster ride
The way you flip your hair
Oh, girl, it gets me every time
You drive me that perfect kind of crazy

And baby, I can feel my heartbeat, heartbeat
Pound in my chest
You in that dress
Makin' it jump like a kick drum on repeat (On repeat)
I love the way you make my heartbeat, heartbeat
There's no mistakin'
Right now it's racin'
Every time that you get close to me (Close to me)
Baby, I can feel my heartbeat

In the middle of the floor we're swayin'
And your favourite song is playin'
Girl, I'm just sayin'

I can feel your heartbeat, heartbeat
Pound in your chest
There in that dress
Makin' it jump like a kick drum on repeat
I love the way you make my heartbeat, heartbeat
There's no mistakin'
Right now it's racin'
Every time that you get close to me (Close to me)
Baby, I can feel my heartbeat, heartbeat (Heartbeat, heartbeat)
Baby, I can feel your heartbeat, heartbeat (Heartbeat, heartbeat)
