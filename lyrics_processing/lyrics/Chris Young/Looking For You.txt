I didn't know what I was missin'
Until the second that you walked in
To that bar that night
Under those neon lights
From the moment that you touched me
I was hoping that you'd love me
Forever and ever, for all time

Didn't know that I had been so blind
But you opened my eyes

I was looking more single every single weekend
Looking for a feeling to get my heart beating
Looking for an up all night long
The right kiss, right song
Looking for a sunrise leading to a sunset
Looking for a someone I can spend it with
Then it came around, right out of the blue
And it turns out
Oh, I was looking for you
Yeah, I was looking for you

Couldn't have just been anyone
The way you smiled and said my name
Girl, you were so original
I knew I'd never be the same
