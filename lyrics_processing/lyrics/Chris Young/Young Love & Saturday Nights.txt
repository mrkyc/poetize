He's got a Chevrolet that don't always run
And the radio never turns down
He's got a pedigree that's no good for nothing
No commas in his bank account

But there's a girl at the hole in the wall
Where he plays, don't take her eyes off the stage

She loves his southern drawl from north of Atlanta
That Silverado he got parked outside
Loves a cranking '89 Alabama
Kissing for an hour in the parking lot light
Here's to good girls that can't keep from falling
For bad boys that their daddies don't like
Small towns that keep staying small
Here's to old trucks, young love, and Saturday nights

Na-na, na-na, na, na-na, na
Saturday nights
Na-na, na-na, na, na-na, na

As long as pawn shops, sell beat up guitars
To a kid with some hand me down keys
As long as leather jackets
Keep stealing hearts like Elvis and Cash and James Dean

Tank of gas, some blue eyes, and some beer in the back
Falling way too fast

For a southern drawl from north of Atlanta
That Silverado he got parked outside
Loves a cranking '89 Alabama
Kissing for an hour in the parking lot light
Here's to good girls that can't keep from falling
For bad boys that their daddies don't like
Small towns that keep staying small
Here's to old trucks, young love, and Saturday nights
Na-na, na-na, na, na-na, na
Saturday nights
Na-na, na-na, na, na-na, na
Yeah, Saturday nights
Na-na, na-na, na, na-na, na
Young love and Saturday nights
