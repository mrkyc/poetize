If you need your car towed
If that Volkswagen breaks down
On the way out of this town
I know a guy
I'll make a few calls
If you need something part time
'Til you're back on your feet
I know a guy

And if you're looking for someone, barely hanging on
Lost the only thing that he ever loved
Wishing you would come over
Give anything just to hold you
If you're trying to find a man
Who lost his mind
Doesn't sleep at night
Unless he's dreaming about you
Laying right here beside him
Praying someday you might feel like forgiving
And think about giving him one more try
Then I know a guy

If you would ask me
To think of a person that didn't deserve you
I know a guy
And if you needed a man to never really listen
Not know what he'd be missing
I know a guy

And if you're looking for someone, barely hanging on
Lost the only thing that he ever loved
Wishing you would come over
Give anything just to hold you
If you're trying to find a man
Who lost his mind
Doesn't sleep at night
Unless he's dreaming about you laying right here beside him
Praying someday you might feel like forgiving
And think about giving him one more try
Then I know a guy

Yeah, I know a guy
Who feels like a fool
He's been hating himself for what he put you through
He'd take it all back if he only knew how
He knows that you've probably moved on by now

But if you're looking for someone, barely hanging on
Lost the only thing that he ever loved
Wishing you would come over
Give anything just to hold you
If you're trying to find a man
Who lost his mind
Doesn't sleep at night
Unless he's dreaming about you laying right here beside him
Praying someday you might feel like forgiving
And think about giving him one more try
Then I know a guy
One, one more try
