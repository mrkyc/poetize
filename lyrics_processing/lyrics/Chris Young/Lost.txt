I'm out on the highway
Just about a mile away
Meet me out in the driveway
I'm gonna be there soon
I'll swing by and pick you up
Don't bother getting fixed up
Me and you and this old truck
Will find something to do

No, I ain't got no plan in mind
It's such a perfect night
So I just thought
That we could go get lost

Lost down some old back road
Lost in a song on the radio
Lost in your deep blue eyes
I don't care if we spend all night
Lost by the river cross the turnpike
Somewhere near nowhere
Is my favorite thing to do
Won't you say girl me and you
Go get a little lost

Come on baby let's go
When we get there we'll know
No bars on the cellphone
Sounds good to me
We can find us a place to park
By the water underneath the stars
And do a little "fishin' in the dark"
If you know what I mean

Well all we need's a tank a gas
So grab that GPS
And turn it off
Let's go get lost

Lost down some old back road
Lost in a song on the radio
Lost in your deep blue eyes
I don't care if we spend all night
Lost by the river cross the turnpike
Somewhere near nowhere
Is my favorite thing to do
Won't you say girl me and you
Go get a little lost
No, I ain't got no plan in mind
And it's such a perfect night
So I just thought we could get

Lost down some old back road
Lost in a song on the radio
Lost in your deep blue eyes
I don't care if we spend all night
Lost by the river cross the turnpike
Somewhere near nowhere
Is my favorite thing to do
Won't you say girl me and you
