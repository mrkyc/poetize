Look: part of me, if you'll pardon me
Is in love, I know we've just met
But a part of you is in part of me, this I know it's more than just sex
I'm like "Oh girl, you're my ghost girl, you (ah!) you take away my breath!"
And if I break your heart or you break my heart
Then there's not a lotta heart left
And I ain't the best at this, ask my ex's this
They probably be glad to tell you this
Thinking that you rebellious
You got a belly button ring but you barely is
(ey) And nobody here celibate
I just wanna love you for a long time
I just wanna pick you up and then toss you 'round
And that body, girl, is all mine

Go, so, what'd you say?
When you gonna let me know
If you give a damn about me?
'Cause you got my hands tied
In my defense, I always fall for confidence
And your compliments look good on me
(I was)
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

On the floor o' the kitchen and I'm feeling all you now
And nobody else is home, we ain't scared of being loud
Baby, it's just me and you
Let me hear you scream it out
Say my name, say my name, wear it out
Say my name, say my name, wear it out
Say my name, say my name, wear it out

Some say one love is dumb love, but I know for sure it ain't true
I've been in and out of a lot of girls, I got stuck when I was in you
And, like, don't you get it confused, you see
You know how them girls they be doing me
They've got nothing on you, that's nothing only
A rubber comes between you and me (ooh!)
Sorry baby, ain't the type chillin' at the party, baby
Ain't the type to pull up in a 'rari, baby
Ain't the moonwalking nigga saying "Call me, baby"
I know, give me that passion please
No tellin' if they're asking me
Just say my name and I'll play the game
And now how you saying "Is this happening?"

Go, so, what'd you say?
When you gonna let me know
If you give a damn about me?
'Cause you got my hands tied
In my defense, I always fall for confidence
And your compliments look good on me
(I was)
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
On the floor o' the kitchen and I'm feeling all you now
And nobody else is home, we ain't scared of being loud
Baby, it's just me and you
Let me hear you scream it out
Say my name, say my name, wear it out
Say my name, say my name, wear it out
Say my name, say my name, wear it out

Say my name, say my name, wear it out
Say my name, say my name, wear it out
Say my name, wear it out
