Kristine, Kristine, look over here
Fabulous, fabulous
Yes, can you hold that pose? (Hold that)
That looks beautiful
Turn around now so we can see your shoes

I know you get a lot of girls but don't eff with me (With me)
Symptoms of last guy backlash, still recovering

You should think twice because I'm not that nice
Might be my human sacrifice
I'm a ticking timebomb, yeah, you should be alarmed
He made me cold as ice

My vendetta, out to get ya
And you can feel me, I'm the chill up your spine
I'm a killer, not your thriller
Boy you better hail to the queen of the night

Now remember
Oh, I'm the assassinator
Oh, I will assassinate ya
Oh, I'm the assassinator
What you waiting for? Get on the floor
For the siren assassin

He made me cold as ice

My vendetta, out to get ya

I'm a killer, not your thriller
Boy you better hail to the queen of the night

Now remember
Oh, I'm the assassinator
Oh, I will assassinate ya

For the siren

Poisons, potions, I'ma get you love-drunk
Take as much as you want, you won't feel a thing
Silly little boy, I got you where I want you
This will put an end to all my suffering
Oh (Assassin)
Oh (Assassin)
Oh (Assassin)
(I'm a ticking timebomb, yeah, you should be alarmed)

My vendetta, out to get ya
And you can feel me, I'm the chill up your spine

Boy you better hail to the queen of the night

Now remember
Oh, I'm the assassinator
