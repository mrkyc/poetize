Couldn't help but watch
When you walked into the room
Dress to impress
Definitely got me checking you, mhm

No, you can't blame me, won't let them tame me
I wasn't looking for somebody tonight
Mystery stranger, right when you came here
It only took a minute for you to change my mind 'cause

Something about you makes me feel so alive
There's no fighting here
You're the one I want, baby, when you kiss me
I, I feel it in me like a sucker punch

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
In me, me, me, me
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I feel it in me like a sucker punch
You might also like
I can't get enough of your touch
Need a little bit more
Push up on me, wanna break the rules
That's what they're made for, for

No, you can't blame me, I let you tame me
I wasn't looking for somebody tonight
Don't be a stranger, put me in danger
It only took a minute for you to change my mind 'cause

Something about you makes me feel so alive
There's no fighting here
You're the one I want, baby, when you kiss me
I, I feel it in me like a sucker punch

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
In me, me, me, me
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I feel it in me like a sucker punch
You hit me with your best shot
Didn't you, didn't you? Didn't you, didn't you?
You hit me with your best shot
Why'd you have to sucker punch me, baby, baby?
You hit me with your best shot
Didn't you, didn't you? Didn't you, didn't you?
You hit me with your best shot
Why'd you have to sucker punch me, baby, baby?

Baby when you kiss me
I, I feel it in me like a sucker punch

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
In me, me, me, me
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I feel it in me like a sucker punch
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (Sucker punch)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
In me, me, me, me
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (Sucker punch)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
