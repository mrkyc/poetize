Tabloid beauty seen around the world
Always such a rush, I'm your crush
Hottest topic, latest thing that hit the scene
I'll put you in touch, so hush

You can do whatever you want
Let's go get fucked up at my place
Don't wanna kill what we got
Just keep those records on replay, p-p-play

I don't want this party to end, no
Just keep the music playing
Don't think you're getting away, no
I'm gonna kidnap, k-kidnap the DJ

Oh, oh, I'm gonna play on in my way
Oh, oh, I'm gonna kidnap the DJ
Oh, oh, I'm gonna play on in my way
Oh, I'm gonna kidnap, k-kidnap the DJ

Alter ego, freaky side, take you on a sexy ride
You're mine, I'll drive
I'll show you things that blow your mind
Moves I would usually hide, but not tonight
You might also like
You can do whatever you want
Let's go get funny in my place
Don't wanna kill what we got
Just keep those records on replay

I don't want this party to end, no
Just keep the music playing
Don't think you're getting away, no
I'm gonna kidnap, k-kidnap the DJ

Oh, oh, I'm gonna play on in my way
Oh, oh, I'm gonna kidnap the DJ
Oh, oh, I'm gonna play on in my way
Oh, I'm gonna kidnap, k-kidnap the DJ

I hope you didn't make no plans tonight
'Cause you're going home with me baby, alright?
I'll be your private dancer 'til the morning light
So I hope you didn't make no plans tonight

I don't want this party to end, no
Just keep the music playing
Don't think you're getting away, no
I'm gonna kidnap, k-kidnap the DJ
Oh, oh, I'm gonna play on in my way
Oh, oh, I'm gonna kidnap the DJ
Oh, oh, I'm gonna play on in my way
