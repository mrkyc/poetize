Yo Kristine, drop it
Good girl, bad boy
Bad boy, good girl
Good girl, bad boy
Bad boy

I'm not a girl from around the way
Don't call me up when you wanna play
Ain't a man that can make me whole
But right when I see you I lose control
Know your rep, it's not too good now
Hear me out so it's understood
Treat me right and I'm here to stay
Treat me wrong and I'm on my way

Come here, just be my bad boy
Tired of being a good girl
I know just what I want and it's you
And it's you
You might also like

Boy, you're making me lose control
It's not like me to just let it go
Have to say that I like your stock
But babe, I know you can't get enough
Boy, you're making me lose my mind
I'm not the kind to wait in line
Know what I want, I'll have my way
Games are over, it's time to play

Come here, just be my bad boy
Tired of being a good girl
I know just what I want and it's you
And it's you

Good girl, bad boy
Bad boy, good girl
Good girl, bad boy
Bad boy
Take off clothes, anything goes
Baby, watch yourself when life takes a hold
I gotta bring it back, I got the boom track
Baby, when you shake it I don't how to act
So I ease in, got the swerving tempo
I know what you got, I brought the instrumental
So don't trip, Kristine, this is it
Epic's on a mission, now hop in the whip, uh

I know what I like and you're just my type
Well, it's gonna take more for me to go there
Show me what you got, 'cause this is your shot
And I like it hot, make me your bad girl

Good girl, bad boy
Bad boy, good girl
Good girl, bad boy
Bad boy

I know what I like and you're just my type
Well, it's gonna take more for me to go there
Show me what you got, 'cause this is your shot
