Yeah, yeah, yeah

I see you looking from the corner of your eye
I wanna step to you but I'm shy
There's a spot in the back of my mind
Not gonna let the chance go by, so
So I stop to creep over
Familiar motion's 'bout to take over
And then I asked your friend for his name
He looked back and he told me "Shane"
I said "I like the way you do what you do
You look lonely, can I dance with you?"
Then a smile rose from his face
Put his hand on my waist, yeah
So I told him...

Pop it like a popstar, baby
Rock it like a rockstar, baby
Drop it like a drop-top, baby
Wind up and then go crazy

Let me see you work it, let me see you shake it
Let me see you freak it, then step back now
(Now, now, now, now)
Now (Now, now, now, now)
You might also like
Ooh, you put your hand up on my shoulder
Say you gotta leave, but can you stay a little longer?
The feelings are getting stronger
The things we do can't get much wronger
But oh, I don't wanna be right
So please could  and meet you tonight
With that being said and done
Can you do that thing one more time for me?

Pop it like a popstar, baby
Rock it like a rockstar, baby
Drop it like a drop-top, baby
Wind up and then go crazy

Let me see you work it, let me see you shake it
Let me see you freak it, then step back now
(Now, now, now, now)
Now (Now, now, now, now)

Baby, come ride with me
I'm everything you never seen
So what you waiting for?
You're welcome through my door
Let's get it on and poppin'
You know that they ain't gon' stop it
Baby show me whatchu got
You and me will make it hot
Pop it like a popstar, baby
Rock it like a rockstar, baby
Drop it like a drop-top, baby
Wind up and then go crazy

Let me see you work it, let me see you shake it
Let me see you freak it, then step back now
(Now, now, now, now)
Now (Now, now, now, now)

Pop it like a popstar, baby
Rock it like a rockstar, baby
Drop it like a drop-top, baby
Wind up and then go crazy

Let me see you work it, let me see you shake it
Let me see you freak it, then step back now
(Now, now, now, now)
