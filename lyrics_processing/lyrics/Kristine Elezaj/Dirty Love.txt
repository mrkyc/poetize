G-G-Give me (Dirty love)
G-G-Give me
It's dirty, it's dirty

Dude, your vibe is kinky and I'm down, down
To get you bumping like an eight-o-eight
Feeling on me in the middle of the crowd, crowd
Heavy petting, put it on display

We get up, up, up, burn me up, sweat it out
You're bringing me closer, my body's like "yeah"
We get up, up, up, dirty love, want it now
It's taking me over, my body's like "yeah"

Oh-oh-oh, keep touching me
I feel your dirty love, love, your love
Oh-oh-oh, keep touching me
I feel your dirty love, love, your love

It's dirty, oh-oh-oh, give me some of that love
It's dirty, oh-oh-oh, that's the love that I love
It's dirty, oh-oh-oh, give me some of that love
I just can't get enough of that dirty love
You might also like
Getting frantic like a panic at the disco
Do it to me, make me scream out loud
You know how to push the buttons on my stereo
Like a speaker, blow me out

We get up, up, up, burn me up, sweat it out
You're bringing me closer, my body's like "yeah"
We get up, up, up, dirty love, want it now
It's taking me over, my body's like "yeah"

Oh-oh-oh, keep touching me
I feel your dirty love, love, your love
Oh-oh-oh, keep touching me
I feel your dirty love, love, your love

It's dirty, oh-oh-oh, give me some of that love
It's dirty, oh-oh-oh, that's the love that I love
It's dirty, oh-oh-oh, give me some of that love
I just can't get enough of that dirty love

If I give myself to you
Will you still love me when the morning comes?
Forever be my guilty pleasure
Tease me with your dirty love
Oh-oh-oh, keep touching me
I feel your dirty love, love, your love
Oh-oh-oh, keep touching me
I feel your dirty love, love, your love

It's dirty, oh-oh-oh, give me some of that love
It's dirty, oh-oh-oh, that's the love that I love
It's dirty, oh-oh-oh, give me some of that love
