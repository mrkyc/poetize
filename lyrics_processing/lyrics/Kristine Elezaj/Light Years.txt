No word from you has got me at the edge of my chair
So paralyzed, my thoughts won't let me move from here
When you left you told me not to cry
"Babe just trust in me, that it's only for a little while"
Can't stop what's meant to be

So I decided that I'd hold on
'Cause I believed in what you promised
Was it in your plan all along
To leave me stranded?

'Cause it's like we're light years apart
Left me with no signal to trace
All of our connection is lost
You're five trillion miles away
You're floating away from my heart
'Cause it's like we're light years apart
You're five trillion miles away

I sacrifice my sleep wishing that you were here
The lies I tell myself just to quiet my fears
You come home and hold me close
But we can feel the space between
Terrified to say that things are not the way they used to be
You might also like
So do we carry on in denial?
Hurting each other more each day
Thinking if we just stay a while
We'll close the distance

'Cause it's like we're light years apart
Left me with no signal to trace
All of our connection is lost
You're five trillion miles away
You're floating away from my heart
'Cause it's like we're light years apart
You're five trillion miles away

You left, I stayed
Because of those promises we made
Abandon us when you went away
Love is out of reach, you're too far gone

'Cause it's like we're light years apart
Left me with no signal to trace
All of our connection is lost
You're five trillion miles away
You're floating away from my heart
'Cause it's like we're light years apart
You're five trillion miles away
Lost in light years, we're lost in light years
Lost in light years, we're lost in light years
Lost in light years, we're lost in light years
