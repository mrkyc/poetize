B-b-boy, you better find a hiding place
'Cause when I get ya, I'ma beat that ass
It might be assault and battery
But it don't matter if I catch that case
(Don't matter if I catch that case, won't care, don't matter if I catch)

As long as I get my revenge
I just don't give a fuck 'bout anything
Long as you're down on your knees
I'd even track down your friends
You're gonna tell me where the fuck you've been
I got a cure for your cheater's disease

Warpath, takin' out the trash
I'm on a warpath
I'm on a warpath
Lookin' for ya
Warpath, takin' out the trash
I'm on a warpath
I'm on a warpath
Lookin' for ya

You're so dirty
Should have known by now you're a man-whore
You're so guilty
Should have known by now that this means war
Warpath, takin' out the trash
I'm on a warpath
I'm on a war--

I saw that trick that you was with tonight
She was Justin Bieber's look-alike (Baby, baby, oh)
Boy, you think you're such a player, right?
But you won't be playing'
When I get my hands around your neck

As long as I get my revenge
I just don't give a fuck 'bout anything
Long as you're down on your knees
I'd even track down your friends
You're gonna tell me where the fuck you've been
I got a cure for your cheater's disease

Warpath, takin' out the trash
I'm on a warpath
I'm on a warpath
Lookin' for ya
Warpath, takin' out the trash
I'm on a warpath
I'm on a warpath
Lookin' for ya

You're so dirty
Should have known by now you're a man-whore
You're so guilty
Should have known by now that this means war
Warpath, takin' out the trash
I'm on a warpath
I'm on a warpath, lookin' for ya
You did it once, then you did it again
You thought I was stupid
Baby boy, think again
You had your fun, now I'll get my revenge
I'm out on a warpath
And you're not gonna win
You did it once, then you did it again
You thought I was stupid
Baby boy, think again
You had your fun, now I'll get my revenge
I'm out on a warpath
And you're not gonna win

Warpath, takin' out the trash
I'm on a warpath
I'm on a warpath
Lookin' for ya
Warpath, takin' out the trash
I'm on a warpath
I'm on a warpath
Lookin' for ya

You're so dirty
Should have known by now you're a man-whore
You're so guilty
Should have known by now that this means war
Warpath, takin' out the trash (I'm talking to you)
I'm on a warpath
