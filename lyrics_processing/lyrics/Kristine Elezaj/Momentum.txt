Remember life starting now, everything felt so brand new
Trying all to figure it out, ran around so confused
Didn't know my mission, only superstition
Inside my heart, didn't know what I was missing

It made sense when I discovered you
The fog lifted and I found a clear view
And everything started moving in the same direction

Don't make me wait for love
(When I can taste it)
Don't make me save my heart
When you can take it away
'Cause this momentum (This momentum)
This momentum (This momentum)
Not even the world can stop the power of our momentum

Every night I lay awake, thinking about what went wrong
Wonder if I have the strength, find a path to where I belong
Staring at the ceiling, nothing to believe in
Sown apart, never know what I was feeling
You might also like
It makes sense when I'm here with you
The clouds open and I see a clear view
And everything is moving in the same direction
You take away all of my concerns
You get me through every twist and turn
And now it feels like I'm staring at my own reflection (Reflection)

Don't make me wait for love
(When I can taste it)
Don't make me save my heart
When you can take it away
'Cause this momentum (This momentum)
This momentum (This momentum)
Not even the world can stop the power of our momentum

I can't fight it any longer so I'm letting go
(Letting go, letting go)
I rush closer, feel your pulse and I lose control (Lose control)
(Letting go, letting go)
There must be a reason we were so afraid
You can't deny the feeling, your love is a part of me
Don't make me wait for love
(When I can taste it, oh I can taste it)
Don't make me save my heart
When you can take it away (You can take it away)
'Cause this momentum (This momentum)
This momentum (This momentum)
Not even the world can stop the power of our momentum
(Can't stop, can't stop, no)

(When I can taste it, oh I can taste it)
Don't make me save my heart
When you can take it away (You can take it away)
'Cause this momentum (This momentum)
This momentum (This momentum)
Not even the world can stop the power of our momentum
