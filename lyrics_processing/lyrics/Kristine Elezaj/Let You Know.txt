Oh, oh, oh, oh

Use me, use me, use me
Knock me down, I come right back
Cut me, chop me, screw me
Like a record I spin right back
You can't just cut me out
'Cause I'm not your paper doll
You are so transparent
Don't try to deny it

Using your position 'cause you can, 'cause you can
I won't be a victim to your plan, to your plan
Sorry you didn't see there's so much more to me
Now I'll be the one that's haunting your dreams

Hurt, but I should have known
That you would do me wrong
I'm better on my own
So I had to let you go
I'm okay, can't get the best of me
It's all a test to me

Thought that I should let you know, let you know
Thought, thought that I should let you know, let you know
Thought, thought that I should let you know, let you know
Thought, thought that I should let you know, let you know
Thought that I should let you know

Gag me, rope me, tie me
Won't be still, can't keep quiet
Got me asking "Why me?"
Got no choice but to fight it
Try and put me away
You just put me on display
Thank you, I don't hate you
I laugh while you're crying

Using your position 'cause you can, 'cause you can
I won't be a victim to your plan, to your plan
Sorry you didn't see there's so much more to me
Now I'll be the one that's haunting your dreams

Hurt, but I should have known
That you would do me wrong
I'm better on my own
So I had to let you go
I'm okay, can't get the best of me
It's all a test to me
Thought that I should let you know, let you know
Thought, thought that I should let you know, let you know
Thought, thought that I should let you know, let you know
Thought, thought that I should let you know, let you know
Thought that I should let you know

I'm not blind, boy I got 20/20
I'm not deaf, I hear you coming honey
No, no, no, you can't take nothing from me
Not that you care, but I just had to let you know

Hurt, but I should have known
That you would do me wrong
I'm better on my own
So I had to let you go
I'm okay, can't get the best of me
It's all a test to me

Thought that I should let you know, let you know
Thought, thought that I should let you know, let you know
Thought, thought that I should let you know, let you know
Thought, thought that I should let you know, let you know
Thought that I should let you know
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
