Use me use me use me
Knock me down i come right back
Cut me chop me screw me
Like a record i spin right back
You can't just cut me out
Cause i'm not your paper doll
You are so transparent
Don't try to deny it

Using your position cause you can

To you plan
Sorry you didn't see

Now i'll be the one thats haunting your dreams
Chorus:
Hurt but I should of known
That you would do me wrong
I'm better on my own

I'm ok
Can't get the best of me
It's all a test to me
Thought that i should let you know, let you know (5x's)

Gag me, rope me, tie me

Got me asking why me
Got no choice but to fight it
Tried to be me away
You just put me on display
Thank you i don't hate you
I laugh while your crying

Not that you care
