Yes, it's time, time for me, play the villain (Yeah, you know it)
Walking on all you men, abuse the power (Yeah, you know it)
Don't need no validation, had enough (Yeah, you know it)
Br-br-breaking my frustration with that bullshit you be saying

They say if I talk back I'ma blow it
I don't give a damn, watch me own it
I do me, just keep going
Won't walk to the beat of your drum (Drum)

I, I got my own control
I ain't gon' play no role
Ain't gotta sleep with you to get what I want
It's too much, overload
I'm 'bout to break the mold
And I'm sorry if it's cold
Thank yourself
You made me a monster

I'm a, a monster, a monster
I'm a, I'm a, a monster, a monster
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, a, a monster
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, a, a monster

Leash is off, out my cage and I'm ready (Ready)
