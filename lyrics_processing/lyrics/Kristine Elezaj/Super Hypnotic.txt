Boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom

Call this fascination
You keep goin' 'round inside my head
You're like a song that's playin' on and on
Tell me how you did it
Got the whole room spinnin'
My body starts to shake
Each time the record plays

Ooh, ooh, ooh
You got your arms around me holding tight
Ooh, ooh, ooh
All I really wanna do is be with you tonight

Slowly moving into position
Like a beat from a kick drum
You're so boom, boom super hypnotic
Floating from the floor to the ceiling
You know I gotta feel it
One more time, rewind, that's right, super hypnotic
You might also like
Don't stop what you're doing
The vibe will be ruined
Just keep movin' on, the one, the three baby
It's so absolutely
Right on point how you move me
Attracted like a magnet
I could get used to this (Used to this)

Ooh, ooh, ooh
You gotta turn it up 'cause it's what I like
Ooh, ooh, ooh
All I really wanna do is be with you tonight

Slowly moving into position
Like a beat from a kick drum
You're so boom, boom super hypnotic
Floating from the floor to the ceiling
You know I gotta feel it
One more time, rewind, that's right, super hypnotic

And I'm mesmerized each and every time
I hear the record spin, my baby goes again
So I close my eyes, I realize that I belong to you
And I can't help but just give in
Slowly moving into position
Like a beat from a kick drum
You're so boom, boom super hypnotic
Floating from the floor to the ceiling
You know I gotta feel it
One more time, rewind, that's right, super hypnotic

Slowly moving into position
Like a beat from a kick drum
You're so boom, boom super hypnotic
Floating from the floor to the ceiling
You know I gotta feel it
