Freakshow, I'm the body you're about get to know
You can't, you can't ignore it
If love is blind, even  you hold the light
Make you taste it, make you crave it
I'ma be the one you savor

We won't stop, no
Ooh, what you think about that?
What's my name, oh?
Go ahead and scream out
I've got what what you want
So I'm about to serve it
Ooh, baby you deserve it
Worth it, work it, na-na-na

So come and take what's yours tonight
Oh-la-la-la-la, give me what I want, eat me alive
It's like the first day of your life
Oh-la-la-la-la, give me what you want, just come inside

So come and taste what's yours tonight
Oh-la-la-la-la, give me what I want, eat me alive
Oh-la-la-la-la, oh-la-la-la-la
