Redrama and the one and only Isac Elliot
I think you need to tell 'em right now Isac, go ahead, hey, let's go

I called you up on the telephone
To let you know, girl, you looking so amazing (Amazing)
Would you be, could you be mine?
I know I acted a bit too cool today in school
Can you please forgive me? (Forgive me?)
Would you be, could you be mine?

Girl, I'll take you to a movie
Hold your hand if you approve it
It's you who makes my heart go boom
I will treat you like a princess
Girl, you're more than gorgeous
Oh, can't you see you'll always be

My lady, my baby
My favorite girl in the world
I'd never let you go
I'd never let you go, no, no
My lady, my baby
My favorite girl in the world
I'd never let you go
I'd never let you go, no, no
You might also like
Girl, you give me butterflies
Your big brown eyes are making me feel shaky
Would you be, could you be mine?
I send my love in an SMS
You are the best, my special little goddess
Would you be, could you be mine?

We can go down to the mall
You can fall back in my arms
While you share a milkshake with me
I will treat you like a princess
Girl, you're more than gorgeous
Oh, can't you see (Oh, can't you see) you'll always be

My lady, my baby
My favorite girl in the world (In the world)
I'd never let you go
I'd never let you go, no, no
My lady, my baby (Yeah, come on, come on)
My favorite girl in the world (Hey, hey)
I'd never let you go
I'd never let you go, no, no
(Now here we go, tell 'em)
No, no, no, no no (No, uh-huh)
I'm never gonna let you go (Never, ever let you go, baby)
Let you go, let you go (Never let you go, uh, come on)
No, no, no, no no
I'm never gonna let you go (Can't let you go, baby)
F-A-V-O-R-I-T-E girl

I remember back in school and trying to act cool
Thinking 'bout you all day, waiting in the hallway
Then at the mall (Hey), you're surrounded by your friends
How can I begin with this heart pounding in my chest?
Now I'm texting, SMSing, waiting
My cell, checking every second, baby
Don't tell me no, just tell me maybe
You're my favorite girl, you're my special lady, come on

My lady, my baby (Uh-huh, yeah)
My favorite girl in the world
I'd never let you go
I'd never let you go, no, no (Never let you go)
My lady, my baby
My favorite girl in the world (Hey)
I'd never let you go
I'd never let you go, no, no (I'd never let you go)
(Now here we go, baby)
No, no, no, no no (Nope, no, no)
I'm never gonna let you go (I'm never gonna let you go, baby)
Let you go, let you go (Never gonna let you go, uh)
No, no, no, no no (Nope, no, ha)
I'm never gonna let you go
