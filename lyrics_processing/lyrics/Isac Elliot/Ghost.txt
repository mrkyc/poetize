Woke up high, a place
It's been a minute
Since I've seen your face
I didn't mean to call
Her by your name
I shouldn't have said it
But I can't forget it, uhh

And I guess, and I guess, and I guess she looks the part, yeah
But I'm a mess, I'm a mess I regret that I broke your heart, yeah
She don't mean what you mean to me
And I wonder if she sees though me
And I wanna say new year, new me but

I think she knows
I see your ghost
No matter what I do
No matter where I go
I still see your ghost
(I still see your ghost)

I'm tryna fill this space
But in the end I'm haunted every day
All my friends, they know
I'm loosing faith
Tonic and spirits, say goodbye to your spirit, uhh

But I'm a mess, I'm a mess I regret that I broke your heart, yeah
She don't mean what you mean to me
And I wonder if she sees though me
And I wanna say new year, new me, but

I think she knows
I see your ghost
No matter what I do
No matter where I go
I still see your ghost
(I still see your ghost)
I think she knows
I see your ghost
She's laying in my bed
But you're all up in my head
I still see your ghost
(I still see your ghost)
