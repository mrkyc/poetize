Barely know me sitting there
Barely know you but we're here
Just a moment, let it in
Let me tell you where I been
Got a story, so do I
Got a new one we should write
So familiar, this is strange
'Cause I hardly know your name

Falling so fast
Maybe this is all meant to be
So, baby, let's not slow down
Don't even take a second to breathe

'Cause right now
It's not for nothing, we're a lesson in love
There's a reason that you're here in my arms
Not for nothing, baby, we can write the rules, uh-huh
'Cause right now
I think we're onto something bigger than us
There's a reason that you're here in my arms
Not for nothing, baby, we can write the rules, uh-huh
You might also like
Not for nothing
Everything you've been through see it's
Not for nothing
For nothing

Different people every day
They can make you lose your way
Girl, I don't know where this ends
Feel the karma kicking in

Falling so fast
Maybe this is all meant to be
So, baby, let's not slow down
Don't even take a second to breath

'Cause right now
It's not for nothing, we're a lesson in love
There's a reason that you're here in my arms
Not for nothing, baby, we can write the rules, uh-huh
'Cause right now
I think we're onto something bigger than us
There's a reason that you're here in my arms
Not for nothing, baby, we can write the rules, uh-huh
Not for nothing
Everything you've been through, see it's
Not for nothing
For nothing

Ooh-ooh-ooh, here in my arms
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah-ooh

'Cause right now
It's not for nothing, we're a lesson in love
There's a reason that you're here in my arms
Not for nothing, baby, we can write the rules, uh-huh
'Cause right now
It's not for nothing, we're a lesson in love
There's a reason that you're here in my arms (There's a reason)
Not for nothing, baby, we can write the rules, uh-huh (Oh)
'Cause right now
I think we're onto something bigger than us
There's a reason that you're here in my arms (Not for nothing)
Not for nothing, baby, we can write the rules, uh-huh

Not for nothing
Everything you've been through, see it's
Not for nothing
