We don't need a plan to live in this moment
Sometimes you gotta take a chance while it's there
I don't wanna spend my whole life hoping
So tell me baby, are we going somewhere?

We don't need to hold back, not for a minute
I'm painting a picture and I want you in it
Anything you dream of, I'll let you live it
I just need to know if we're going somewhere

Or are we waving at cars? Just
Watching them pass, is
That who we are? Just
Stuck at the start, and
Watching them go back
Waiting for a ride
Wondering if we're gonna be alright

Waving at cars
Wishing they were ours
Why are we waving at cars? Just
Watching them pass, is
That all we are?
Just waving at cars
You might also like
We could spend the night going round in circles
Talking about all the fears we share
Or we could just go get those windows open
And you and I could finally go somewhere

We don't need to hold back, not for a minute
I'm painting a picture and I want you in it
Anything you dream of, I'll let you live it
I just need to know if we're going somewhere

Or are we waving at cars? Just
Watching them pass, is
That who we are? Just
Stuck at the start, and
Watching them go back
Waiting for a ride
Wondering if we're gonna be alright

Waving at cars
Wishing they were ours
Why are we waving at cars? Just
Watching them pass, is
That all we are? (Is that all we are?)
Just waving at cars
I'm tired of being stuck at the start
Even if it tears us apart
I'd rather go then stay where we are
Just waving at cars
