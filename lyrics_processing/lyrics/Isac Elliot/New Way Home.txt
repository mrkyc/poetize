My home is where your heart is
Want you to know you own it
And that you've had it from the start
I hate to see your tears
There are things you need to hear
Let me talk to you, baby

'Cause you need things he cannot buy
Yeah, you want him to make you smile
Carving our names in a tree
Just you and me, the rain can't wash that away

New way home
I dream a little dream of ya
To be with ya
Stone by stone
I'm working on a dream for ya
The best for ya
New way home
I dream a little dream of ya
To be with ya
Stone by stone
I'm working on a dream for ya
The best for ya

Your home is where my heart is
Want you to know that I want it that way

I'd love to feel you near (I'd love to feel you near)
There are things you need to see
Ooh, let me show it to you, baby

'Cause I got things he cannot buy
I know that I can make you smile
Carving our names in a tree
Just you and me, the rain can't wash that away

New way home
I dream a little dream of ya

I know that these are the times
When people lock their doors and hide inside
Girl, I know if you'll be mine
You're safe here with me 'til the end of time

New way home
I dream a little dream of ya
To be with ya
Stone by stone (Stone by stone)
I'm working on a dream for ya
(I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, dreaming a dream of ya)
The best for ya
New way home (Dreaming a dream of you)
I dream a little dream of ya
To be with ya
Stone by stone
I'm working on a dream for ya
