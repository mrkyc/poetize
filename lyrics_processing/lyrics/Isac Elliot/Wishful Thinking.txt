You tell me stop, you tell me go
Show me a sign, just let me know

'Cause loving you, girl, is like rolling the dice
Never know what I'm gonna get
Because you're hot then you're cold
Then you're left then you're right
Wanna hear you say it

You just keep me wishful thinking
Girl, just tell me what you're feeling
Still, I'm holding on believing
Someday you'll, someday you'll talk to me
Someday you'll, you'll give it all to me
'Til then I'm just wish, wish, wish, wish, wish
Wishful thinking

I'll give you time, I'll give you space
But make up your mind 'cause I just can't wait

'Cause loving you, girl, girl is like rolling the dice
Never know what I'm gonna get
Because you're shy then you're bold
Then you're yes then you're no
Girl I always gotta guess
You might also like
You just keep me wishful thinking
Girl, just tell me what you're feeling
Still, I'm holding on believing
Someday you'll, someday you'll talk to me
Someday you'll, you'll give it all to me
'Til then I'm just wish, wish, wish, wish, wish
Wishful thinking

Girl, you got me confused, all I really want is you
I'll meet you, where you at?
Don't do me like that, don't do me like that
Don't do me like that (Don't do me like that)
Don't do me like that (Don't do me like that)
Don't do me like that (Don't do me like that)
Don't do me like that

You just keep me wishful thinking (Wishful thinking)
Come on, tell me what you're feeling
(Come on, tell me what you're feeling)
Still, I'm holding on believing
Someday you'll, someday you'll talk to me
Someday you'll, you'll give it all to me
'Til then I'm just wish, wish, wish, wish, wish
