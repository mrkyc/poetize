Girl, I'll be your lollipop, your sugar rush
Tease you when you're with your friends and make you blush
Baby, let me turn into your teenage crush
If I could be your first
Girl, I wouldn't wanna leave you alone
I'd call you up, say, "what up" on the phone
Hang with you after school and walk you home
If I could be your first

I see you (You're looking so fine)
You see me (Will you be mine?)
Girl, take the first step with me
Take it with me tonight, oh

I wanna be your first kiss, your first kiss
I know you wanna feel like this, like this
Girl, I'm gonna show you what true love is
I wanna be your first kiss, your first kiss
I wanna be your first kiss, your first kiss
I know you wanna feel like this, like this
Girl, I'm gonna show you what true love is
I wanna be your first kiss, your first kiss
I wanna be your first kiss
You might also like
I'll tag you at my show so your friends can see
It'll be all over Facebook that you're with me
Girl, you need to know I don't fall easily
I wish I could be your first

I see you (You're looking so fine)
You see me (Will you be mine?)
Girl, take the first step with me
Take it with me tonight

I wanna be your first kiss, your first kiss
I know you wanna feel like this, like this
Girl, I'm gonna show you what true love is
I wanna be your first kiss, your first kiss
I wanna be your first kiss, your first kiss
I know you wanna feel like this, like this
Girl, I'm gonna show you what true love is
I wanna be your first kiss

I wanna take you, take you, take you
Far and beyond
I wanna take you, take you, take you
Up, up to the stars, ooh
I'll let nothing, nothing, nothing
Get in our way
It's just you and me, babe
I wanna be your first kiss
I know you wanna feel like this
Girl, I'm gonna show you what true love is
I wanna be your first kiss
I wanna be your first kiss
I know you wanna feel like this
Girl, I'm gonna show you what true love is
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be your first kiss
I wanna be your first kiss (First kiss)
I know you wanna feel like this (Feel like this)
Girl, I'm gonna show you what true love is
I wanna be your first kiss, your first kiss
I wanna be your first kiss (First kiss)
I know you wanna feel like this (Feel like this)
Girl, I'm gonna show you what true love is
I wanna be your first kiss, your first kiss

I wanna be your first kiss, your first kiss
I wanna be your first kiss, your first kiss
