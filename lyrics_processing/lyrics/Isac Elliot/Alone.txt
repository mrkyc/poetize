If you don't love me baby, leave me alone

There was a time that I would've done anything for you, lady
I would boot down the sun from the sky 'cause that's how much I adored you, baby
But to hear telling lately only thing I ever bring you is down
Say you don't even have a clue as to why you even sticking around?

Girl, I gave you so much
But it's never enough
Keep talking so wrong
Baby, tell me, tell me what's that about

If you don't love me
If you don't love me, baby, why don't you leave me?
Just leave me alone
We're playing games, baby, why don't you leave me?
Just leave me alone

Alone, alone
If you don't love me, baby leave me alone
Alone, alone
If you don't love me, baby, leave me alone
You might also like
And don't think
That I didn't know 'bout
All the little secrets you keepin'
Couldn't leave it in the past
And it's getting in the way
I wish that you could believe, yeah

Girl, I gave you so much
But it's never enough
Keep talking so wrong
Baby, tell me, tell me what's that about

If you don't love me
If you don't love me, baby, why don't you leave me?
Just leave me alone
We're playing games, baby, why don't you leave me?
Just leave me alone

Alone, alone
If you don't love me, baby leave me alone
Alone, alone
If you don't love me, baby, leave me alone
Sure I might be insecure, a little immature
But I still love you, baby
I gave everything I had, this is on your life
I said I love you, baby
I said I love you, baby
I said I love you, baby
I said I love you, baby, oh

If you don't love me, baby, why don't you leave me?
Just leave me alone
We're playing games, baby, why don't you leave me?
(Why don't you leave) Just leave me alone

Alone, alone
If you don't love me, baby, leave me alone
Alone, alone
Leave me alone, I said leave me alone

If you don't love me, baby, why don't you leave me?
(Why don't you leave) Just leave me alone
We're playing games, baby, why don't you leave me?
(Why don't you leave) Just leave me alone
Alone, alone
If you don't love me, baby leave me alone, ooh
Alone, alone
If you don't love me, baby, leave me alone
Alone (Alone), alone (Alone)
If you don't love me, baby leave me alone
(Leave me) Alone, (Leave me) alone
