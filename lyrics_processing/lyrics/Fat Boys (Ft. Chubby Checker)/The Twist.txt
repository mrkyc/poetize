Aah, we're back
Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Take me by my little hand and go like this
The party was packed, I'm talkin' back to back
There was a rapper that was rappin' to a beat that was wack
They was going through the motions out on the dance floor
An' when the rapper was done they wasn't yellin' encore
The people were tired of the same old groove
They wanted something def, something new and improved
Something easy to do but hard to resist
I got something for y'all, what do you call it? The Twist!
Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Chubby Checker and the Fat Boys, we're doin' The Twist
Take us by our little hands and go like this
We, we, we broke into the booth and the record stacks
Came up with The Twist and we were scratchin' the track
People started jammin' hard to the funky sound
Did The Twist down and up, then up and down
Then I heard somebody yell: "Yo Chubby's here"
The people took a little pause just to stop and stare
He said: "I'll show you people how to Twist with style
'Cause I've been doin' The Twist for a long long while"
