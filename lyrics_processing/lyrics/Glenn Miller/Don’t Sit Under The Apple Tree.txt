{male vocals}
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me
No! No! No!
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Till I come marchin' home
Don't go walkin' down Lover's Lane with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me
No! No! No!
Don't go walkin' down Lover's Lane with anyone else but me
Till I come marchin' home
I just got word from a guy who heard from the guy next door to me
The girl he met just loves to pet and it fits you to-a-tee
So, don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Till I come marchin' home

Don't give out with those lips of yours to anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me
No! No! No!
Watch the girls on the foreign shores, you'll have to report to me
When you come marchin' home
Don't hold anyone on your knee, you better be true to me
You better be true to me, you better be true to me
Don't hold anyone on your knee, you're gettin' the third degree
When you come marchin' home
You're on your own where there is no phone and I can't keep tab on you
Be fair to me, I'll guarantee this is one thing that I'll do
I won't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but you
Till you come marchin' home
{all}
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
I know the apple tree is reserved for you and me
And I'll be true till you come marchin' home
