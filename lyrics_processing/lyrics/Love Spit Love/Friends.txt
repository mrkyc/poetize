It's kinda rainy
I've a feeling i don't want to know
I'm walking down the pavement
Here i go
I'm heading for a place
I've been a million times before
And there's a thousand better ways
That i could spend my time
Than coversation with somebody
Where the sun don't shine
There's lots of people i can be around
And not pretend
That i've been everywhere before
And i call 'em my friends
Friends
Somebody's got a party where i go
I wish i lost the invitation
There's nobody there i know
Conversation gets too loud
Too many people want to talk
I wish they'd turn it all down
And everybody's got
A million different points of view
But when you're looking out the window
That they're looking through
Don't you think it's kinda stupid
Trying to jump onto the rat race
Train that's going the same way too
And there's a thousand better ways
That i could spend my time
Than coversation with somebody
Where the sun don't shine
There's lots of people i can be around
And not pretend
That i've been everywhere before
And i call 'em my friends
Friends
I look at my reflection on their wall
I feel so empty
I'm surprised to see my face in there at all
I make up an excuse to call my phone
And less than 20 minutes later
I'm in a taxi heading home
And richard burton's on a benderz
Trying to get back home
He's never been so many miles
From back where he comes from
He must be 20 times the legal limit
Staring at the end
There's not a telephone for miles
I want to talk to my friends
There's a thousand better ways
That i can spend my time
Than coversation with somebody
Where the sun don't shine
There's lots of people i can be around
And not pretend
That i've been everywhere before
And i call 'em my friends
