I didn't even see it coming (woah oh)
The bad bite of harsh reality
The something connecting
The nothing of you and me

You've been sounding kinda scratchy
So I checked the connection
Maybe I'll check the doctor for hearing correction
Can't speak too highly
On the subject of high fidelity, yeah
Turn up! Not hearing a word you say
Turn down, listen to what I parlez
Burn up!  When tempers are running high
Burn down everything we've built last night

Last night was a bitch for me
I didn't even see it coming (woah oh)
A bad fight and no apologies
A something connecting the nothing...
Bring the left to the center and the right to the middle
We have to come together, the answer to the riddle
Don't wanna fight no more
Bring the left to the center and the right to the middle
We have to come together, the answer to the riddle
Get back to hearing mono
Too much stereo
Woah oh!
You might also like
Living on the left side of the conversation
Maybe I'll turn my back on this humiliation
You're always wrong, I'm always right
I'm on the left and you're on the right
Turn up! (check the connection)
Hah!
Burn up! (hearing correction)
Yeah!

Last night was a bitch for me
I didn't even see it coming (woah oh)
The bad bite of harsh reality
The something connecting the nothing...
Bring the left to the center and the right to the middle
We have to come together, the answer to the riddle
Don't wanna fight no more
Bring the left to the center and the right to the middle
We have to come together, the answer to the riddle
Get back to hearing mono
Too much stereo, ooh oh
I'm selfish I know
You saved me the effort of being for real
As long as you stand there and listen to reason
My colors won't show
No one will ever know
Will ever know...
Yeah!
Last night, oh last night, oh last night
Last night, oh last night
Bring the left to the center and the right to the middle
We have to come together, the answer to the riddle
Don't wanna fight no more
Bring the left to the center and the right to the middle
We have to come together, the answer to the riddle
Can't live my life in mono
Bring the left to the center and the right to the middle
We have to come together, the answer to the riddle
Get back to hearing mono
Too much stereo
Woah oh
Woah oh
