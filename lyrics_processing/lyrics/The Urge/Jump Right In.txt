Sitting at the edge of the bed
One million thoughts as I reflect
Tease me just a little I'm not hard to persuade
Fully aware for this that I might pay
Not too much that can be said
Thinking about the bad things in my head
Always wondering if what they said was true
Now I'm in the bed with...
Even though she was no stranger
Chose the one keep me out of danger
No song and dance just jump right in

Fought the urge to do it - skin to skin
What the hell here I go - jump right in
Fought the urge to do it - skin to skin
What the hell here I go - jump right in

Standing in the doorway of distress
Ask MD, for ways out of this mess
A wave of panic every time I lose a hair
I believe I'm falling apart but not quite despair
Turns into this one thing I just can't ignore
Don't know what I am feeling anymore
I guess it's time to end this affair
Like I don't care I don't care

Even though she was no stranger
Chose the one keep me out of danger
No song and dance I took my chances with her
No time to waste
Just jump right in I said to her
Stand in the doorway of distress
No time to waste just jump right in

Fought the urge to do it - skin to skin
What the hell here I go - jump right in
Fought the urge to do it - skin to skin
