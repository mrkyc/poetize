Berate me right to my face
I'm not quite as dumb as I look...
Much advantage of me, you took
It's a play-open up your mouth so I can check for truth decay
There could be no finer liar
In the whole state of North Carolina
I gave you my friendship, and a piece of my heart
You managed to break the bonds and barriers
So now I have to pull your card
Push on like Flintstone-your ass is too fake for me
Push on like Flintstone-just as fast as you can
Push on like Flintstone-your eyes are too blind to see
Please stop pretending. I don't like you, and you don't like me
Pretending to be my friend...
A pretty lame attempt-try to fit in
You fucked up yeah, but you still can't see
I listened to you fool, now listen to me
To me there will be no finer
In the whole state of North Carolina
I gave you my friendship and a piece of my heart
You managed to break the bond, barbarian
So now I have to pull your card
Push on like Flintstone-your ass is too fake for me
Push on like Flintstone-just as fast as you can
Push on like Flintstone-your eyes are too blind to see
Please stop pretending. I don't like you, and you don't like me
To me there will be no finer
In the whole state of North Carolina
I gave you my friendship and a piece of my heart
You managed to break the bond, barbarian
So now I have to pull your card
Push on like Flintstone-your ass is too fake for me
Push on like Flintstone-just as fast as you can
Push on like Flintstone-your eyes are too blind to see
Please stop pretending. I don't like you, and you don't like me
