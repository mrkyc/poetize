Yeah, alright

Sweepin' through another year and we're picking up speed
Never gonna give it up definitely
Take it to another level, grab the shovel
And scoop the rest out of my way, giddy like a schoolboy
Got the tools, boy, never play the unemployed
Comin' with velocity with the needles in the red
Think I lost my sanity

Straight to hell, that's where I sent 'em
Straight to hell, that's where I sent 'em
Straight to hell, that's where I sent 'em
Straight to hell

Here we come again
Bring another jam, with the mic in my hand
Yeah, you know we slam
Moving forward with momentum
Straight to hell, that's where we sent 'em
Sometimes freaky, sometimes we get nice
If it feels good, sometimes we do it twice
Or three times or four times or five or six
Rewind the tape, get me back in the mix
We'd like to thank our friends for a hell of a time
We hope it never ends
Crack a little smile when it's time to get high, so come on

Straight to hell, that's where I sent 'em
Straight to hell, that's where I sent 'em
Straight to hell, that's where I sent 'em
Straight to hell
Straight to hell, that's where I sent 'em
Straight to hell, that's where I sent 'em
Straight to hell, that's where I sent 'em
Straight to hell, come on

Yeah, allow me to illustrate and paint the perfect picture of the perfect perpetrator
Make me look down on the up stroke cause I got no love for the evil imitator
I live to hear the people yellin' and screamin' and clappin' and
Toe tappin'
Ain't gonna be no gum flappin'
To what, to shun, to what, to shun, yeah, to just turn away

Straight to hell, that's where I sent 'em
Straight to hell, that's where I sent 'em
Straight to hell, that's where I sent 'em
Straight to hell
Straight to hell, that's where I sent 'em
Straight to hell, that's where I sent 'em
Straight to hell, that's where I sent 'em
