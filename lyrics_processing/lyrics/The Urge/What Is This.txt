It indicated something was on
In the morning I yawn - take a look in the glass and turn my toothbrush on
Excuse me if I refer to this as it but it's soothing and cooling and
Calming me down-when I feel like Michael Douglas in "Falling
Down" - Like Calgon, it takes me away
101 nights of great flex - I like to keep the words simple about
Something complex
I'm shifting into second gear when I'm racing down the road with my
Baby blue and a hole in my shoe
What is this-what is this-things are happening, quite a bliss
The world is shifting-let me out, let me out
What is this-what is this-things that happen, don't wanna miss
The globe is shifting-when the fires burn, turn the knob cause
That's the way the world turns
008 on the zodiac brand-Doctor Pryor, the lion, the lion under fire
When it's crazy like Rodman, strange like Rice
Light a candle Teddy Pendergrass and turn off the lights
I plop myself down on the couch and let the action begin
I'm lifting weights so he can wash away all my sins
What is this-what is this-things are happening, quite a bliss
The world is shifting-let me out, let me out
What is this-what is this-things that happen, don't wanna miss
The globe is shifting-when the fires burn, turn the knob cause
That's the way the world turns

He's selling underwear
The ghost in the tube is the living in the air-but we're falling at 32
Feet per second squared
What is this-what is this-things are happening, quite a bliss
The world is shifting-let me out, let me out
What is this-what is this-things that happen, don't wanna miss
The globe is shifting-let me out, let me out
What is this-what is this-things that happen, don't wanna miss
The globe is shifting-when the fires burn
Turn the knob cause
That's the way the world turns
And they were falling at 32 feet per second squared
