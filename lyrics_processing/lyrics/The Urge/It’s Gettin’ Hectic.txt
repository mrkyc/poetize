Similar to groove so freely, people say I'm gettin' kinda greedy, but so what
I'm supplyin' the needy
Some MC's go for therapy, I bury the remains of the others cause they suck incredibly
Superficial styles only last a little while, they never hold a candle to the Steve E profile
More than just wit, and more than just intellect, I'm more than a gangsta cause I kill with a mic check
I'm not the one with the H on his back, I fill up the place with the presence it lacks
It's gettin' hectic, it's gettin' crazy! It's gettin' hectic, it's gettin' wild
It's gettin' hectic, it's gettin' crazy! It's gettin' hectic, it's gettin' wild
Rearrangin' the script as my words shift gear in a flash, puttin' cash in the stash ain't nothin' funny money
Greater gifts are received by those who are blessed, me I got a treasure chest
By all means protected at all times, you try to front and you'll pay more than a small fine
I don't brag about the stuff I get, cause if you roll correctly, demolish the stupid kids
They're runnin' off with the lip, not accomplishin' zip
I tell 'em wake up son, 'cause this is it, peep out the suckers who are faking, flaking moves on the mic and in life
It's gettin' hectic, it's gettin' crazy! It's gettin' hectic, it's gettin' wild
It's gettin' hectic, it's gettin' crazy! It's gettin' hectic, it's gettin' wild
It's gettin' hectic, it's gettin' crazy! It's gettin' hectic, it's gettin' wild
It's gettin' hectic, it's gettin' crazy! Yeah take it down, uh. Yeah
Check it, yo, when mic stands free, I done step to the point of attack cause the track feels good to me and I intend to break you out of your restraint
