Come from a long line of tough
And I'm built to stand my ground
Yeah, when push comes to shove
I don't back up and I don't back down
Because I know just what
Is back home that I'm fighting for
I'll storm through the gates of hell
Even if it means I'm walkin' on heaven's door

So don't tread on me or my memory
I fight for you so that you're free
We've never met, but bet I'll do it again
And I'll lose my mind; I'll give my life
If that's what it costs for that flag to fly
And I'll wear it proud like all the others before me
Why the hell you think they call it Old Glory?

Rolling through the sea
Or boots down in the sea
Those eyes in the sky
The Lord knows that you're in good hands
In the land of the free, it doesn't matter where you are
Always have will always be fighting for the stripes and every star
Every star
You might also like
So don't tread on me or my memory
I fight for you so that you're free
We've never met, but bet I'll do it again
And I'll lose my mind; I'll give my life
If that's what it costs for that flag to fly
And I'll wear it proud like all the others before me
Why the hell you think they call it Old Glory?

The eagle spreads its wings all over the world
Too many miles from husbands and wives
And little boys and girls back home
Missin' first steps and wedding rings
Last words and angel wings
But if that's what it takes, that's what it takes

So don't tread on me or my memory
I fight for you so that you're free
We've never met, but bet I'll do it again
And I'll lose my mind; I'll give my life
If that's what it costs for that flag to fly
And I'll wear it proud like all the others before me
Why the hell you think they call it Old Glory?
That's why we call her Old Glory
