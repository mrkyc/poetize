To protect the innocent, which would be, me
Well, I missed class today, slept in a little late
Had too much fun last night
At least I got a A on my last test
I drank a case of Keystone Light
Well, that's the beer we drink here
You'll always get your money's worth
You put your beer goggles on, and they don't wear off
Until you're lovin the worst
So let's change the subject
Well how about those grades?
Well there's an A in alcohol
A B in beer, C is for the night class we live all year
D is for drunk, and there ain't no E
So F is for, for Everclear
The teacher missed class today, slept in a little late
Had too much fun last night
At least she took us up on our last offer
To drink some warm red wine
She used to be a stripper at the Ol Red Fox
Down on Highway 69
Well let me tell you friends, her shirt came off
By the end of the night

So we missed class today, slept in a little late
Had too much fun last night
Well I woke up this morning without any warning
Ms. Carter's layin' by my side
Well I got a full ride all last night
She really knows her Sex Ed
And I learned more with my hands on
Than any book I've ever read
Well let's change the subject
Well how about those grades?
There's an A in alcohol
A B in beer, C is for Ms. Carter who's asleep right here

So F is for, for Everclear
That ol' D is for drunk, and there ain't no E
