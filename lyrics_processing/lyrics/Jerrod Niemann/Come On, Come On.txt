Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

I wish each day was like a Friday night
A cold drink, my baby by my side
With no worries anywhere around
Life's a party if you want it to be
If you've got friends well that's all you need
So crank the music up and come unwound, yeah

Come on, come on, come on
Forget your problems
Come on, come on, come on
We've all got them
Come on, come on, come on
Put them in the past
Come on, come on, come on
Kick your shoes off
Come on, come on, come on
Just sing along
Come on, come on, come on
And just relax
Come on and lay on back (Come on, come on, come on)

Well if we all took life a little more slow
Not in such a hurry and out of control
Well we just might find a little piece of mind, that's right
We can tip our hat, wave and smile
Mix the city life with some country style
So join me, twist a top, let's all unwind, yeah

Come on, come on, come on
Forget your problems
Come on, come on, come on
We've all got them
Come on, come on, come on
Put them in the past
Come on, come on, come on
Kick your shoes off
Come on, come on, come on
Just sing along
Come on, come on, come on
And just relax
Come on and lay on back
Come on, come on, come on
Forget your problems
Come on, come on, come on
We've all got them
Come on, come on, come on
Take a minute to laugh
Come on, come on, come on
Forget your problems
Come on, come on, come on
We've all got them
Come on, come on, come on
Put them in the past
Come on and lay on back(Come on, come on, come on...)
(Come on, come on, come on)
(We gonna take on the world oh)
Forget your problems
Come on and lay on back (Come on, come on, come on...)
Kick your shoes off (Come on, come on, come on...)
And sing along (Come on, come on, come on...)

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
