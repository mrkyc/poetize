Baby I know this week has felt like two
No time for me and you
When you get home, here's what I want you to do
Kick up your shoes and kick back
Fill up a bubble bath, relax
Take your time and I'll be waiting

Like whiskey waiting on ice
Like red lips waiting on wine
It's Friday, can't wait to take you out
Like a floor waiting on a summertime dress
Sheets waiting on your hair in a mess
A candle waiting on a fire to melt it down
Like whiskey waiting on ice
I can't wait to hold you tonight

Been a while since we've been out on the town
Wanna show you off and show you how
I don't care where we go right now, as long as I'm with you
Girl I know you really like to dance
It's about time you get the chance
Get in these arms of mine, your man is waiting
You might also like
Like whiskey waiting on ice
Like red lips waiting on wine
It's Friday, can't wait to take you out
Like a floor waiting on a summertime dress
Sheets waiting on your hair in a mess
A candle waiting on a fire to melt it down
Like whiskey waiting on ice
I can't wait to hold you  tonight

I haven't loved
Loved on you lately
It's time to love
Love on you baby, baby

Like whiskey waiting on ice
Like red lips waiting on wine
It's Friday, can't wait to take you out
Like a floor waiting on a summertime dress
Sheets waiting on your hair in a mess
A candle waiting on a fire to melt it down
Like whiskey waiting on ice
I can't wait to hold you  tonight
Like whiskey waiting on ice
No, I can't wait to hold you
I can't wait to hold you tonight
Whiskey waiting, whiskey waiting on ice
