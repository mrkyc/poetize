Put my Chevy in the ditch, couple grand to get it fixed
Bank account runnin' dry, boss ain't got no overtime
Friday rolls around, gotta get this party to town
Got nothing to drive, but just outside I hear my ride

Gonna ride that donkey, donkey
Down to the honky tonky
It's gonna get funky, funky
Gonna ride that donkey, donkey
Down to the honky tonky
It's gonna get funky, funky

George Jones took a John Deere tractor, hope my donkey gets there faster
When I pull up in no pickup truck, jocks break out in laughter
But the ladies think it's cool, I kick it with a mule
I fill their glass, they tip them back
They dig the way I ride that ass and I do, you would if you could, too
They all walk funny when they're done, riding you know who

Gonna ride that donkey, donkey
Down to the honky tonky
It's gonna get funky, funky
(Donkey bray)
Gonna ride that donkey, donkey
Down to the honky tonky
It's gonna get funky, funky
(Donkey bray)

All the ladies like to ride, oh, the ladies like to ride
Oh, the ladies like to ride, the ladies like my D-O-N-K-E-Y

Well, they say that's it last call, no, I don't sweat it, y'all
Got a bottle in the saddle, a six pack in the stall
So, baby, what you say we giddy up to my place
We hit the barn, ain't no harm rolling in the hay, hey

Gonna ride that donkey, donkey
Down to the honky tonky
It's gonna get funky, funky
