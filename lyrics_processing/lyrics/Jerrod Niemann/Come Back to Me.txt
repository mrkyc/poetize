(I'm not a toy, don't act like a boy)
Come back to me
(We fall so much how are we still standing)
Oh
(Let's toss this thing like a boomerang, I'm empty handed)
Come back to me
(Come back to me)
We say we're good as gone
But then we cross those lines we've drawn
It's like we're taking turns
Throwin' matches at a bridge that will not burn
So won't you
Come back to me
(Come back to me)
Come back to me
(Come back to me)
Come back to me
(Come back to me)
Come back to me
(Come back to me)
You win
Come back to me
(Come back to me)
Come back to me
(Come back to me)
Come back to me
(Come back to me)

Come back to me
(We fall so much how are we still standing)
Oh
(Let's toss this thing like a boomerang, I'm empty handed)
Come back to me
(Come back to me)
It this love or just a game?
We hide the passion, crave the pain
And in the midst of slammin' doors
I'm back in your arms wondering what we're fighting for
So won't you
Come back to me
(Come back to me)
Come back to me
