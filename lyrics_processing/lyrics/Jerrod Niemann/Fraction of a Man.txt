Suits and rich folks don't make me nervous, no
But I respect the law and those below the clay
And I don't answer to those who question
My job, my lingo or my religion
See I know well those are choices I made
I take the high in the road
Give the light of the load
I live my life with passion and love
I'm a man, not a fraction of
Me and my friends tend to spend time
Laughing at jokes with the same ol punch lines
Still I wouldn't trade those wasted days
Oh, that's right
And I don't always learn my lesson
Haven't left the best first impressions
And my baby knows I'm stubborn and stuck in my ways
I take the high in the road
Give the light of the load
I live my life with passion and love
I'm a man, not a fraction of

Aw, lets play
The eagle flies with the right and left wings
I'm partial to farmers with small town families
No, I don't forget where I was born and raised
And I don't claim to be a Rhodes scholar
I'm rough on the edges, blue in the collar
But I ain't alone, I'm feeling proud to say
I take the high in the road
Give the light of the load
I live my life with passion and love
I'm a man, not a fraction of
I take the high in the road
Give the light of the load
I live my life with passion and love
I'm a man, not a fraction of
I take the high in the road
Give the light of the road, aw
I live my life with passion and love
I'm man not a fraction of
