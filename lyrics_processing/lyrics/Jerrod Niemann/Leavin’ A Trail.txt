Lipstick stain on a little white straw
Two lonely glasses sitting on the bar
We're leavin' a trail
We're leavin' a trail
Goodyear marks in the gravel rock
Leading out of that parking lot
Leavin' a trail
Yeah, leavin' a trail

Leavin' a trail of love behind us
No we don't care who finds us
All over you, all over me
All out there for the world to see
Girl you know we're not controlling ourselves
Yeah, we're leavin' a trail
Yeah, we're leavin' a trail
Where we're going it ain't hard to tell
Yeah, we're leavin' a trail
Yeah, we're leavin' a trail

House keys still hanging in an open door
One high heel still on the porch
We're leavin' a trail
We're leavin' a trail
Smell of smoke and candles burning
Sound of Motown vinyl turning
You and me making our way to morning
You in my eyes, me in yours
You might also like
With a trail of love behind us
No we don't care who finds us
All over you, all over me
All out there for the world to see
Girl you know we're not controlling ourselves
Yeah, we're leavin' a trail
Yeah, we're leavin' a trail
Where we're going it ain't hard to tell
Yeah, we're leavin' a trail
Yeah, we're leavin' a trail

When we come to and the sun comes in
We'll trace our steps to where it all began
So we can do it all over again

Leavin' a trail of love behind us
No we don't care who finds us
All over you, all over me
All out there for the world to see
Girl you know we're not controlling ourselves
Yeah, we're leavin' a trail
Yeah, we're leavin' a trail
Where we're going it ain't hard to tell
Yeah, we're leavin' a trail
Yeah, we're leavin' a trail
Girl you know we're not controlling ourselves
Yeah, we're leavin' a trail
Yeah, we're leavin' a trail
Where we're going it ain't hard to tell
Yeah, we're leavin' a trail
