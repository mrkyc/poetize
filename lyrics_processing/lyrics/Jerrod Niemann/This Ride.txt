I don't wanna love you for a weekend
I don't want that goodbye kiss before I drive away
I don't wanna love you for a weekend
And put it out like a cigarette, you don't need to go

I could just lay on the gas with you sitting pretty
Chuck T's on the dash all night on this ride
Chasing these white lines
I could hit cruise control, yeah, we could roll slow
We could park in the  glow of the streetlight
I just know that I wanna stay on this ride
I wanna stay on this ride
All night with you

I don't wanna spin these tires 'cause I can't sleep
See a couple in a car being everything we're not
We could cruise down to the South Side pier beach
Listen to the waves in the dark, I don't need to drop you off

I could just lay on the gas with you sitting pretty
Chuck T's on the dash all night on this ride
Chasing these white lines
I can hit cruise control, yeah, we could roll slow
We could park in the  glow of the streetlight
I just know that I wanna stay on this ride
I wanna stay on this ride
All night with you
I wanna stay on this ride
I wanna stay on this ride
All night with you

I don't want that goodbye kiss

Chasing these white lines
I can hit cruise control, yeah, we could roll slow
We could park in the  glow of the streetlight
I just know that I wanna stay on this ride
I wanna stay on this ride
All night with you
I wanna stay on this ride
I wanna stay on this ride
