Alright

 forward sitting off shore
And that sun is hot as tobasco
Coast is killing that glare
While I sip and stare bikinis going by in a bass boat
Life is good only getting better
Got no words living free as a feather
My guitar floats, back porch is my boat
Just jamming all the happy notes

Well it's a sundown song, halfway to drunk
Hey wanna hang, what you got in that cup
Kinda feeling
(Baby don't stop fill it up to the top)
It's a slow it on down, pass one around
Smoke in the air yeah we can all share
That kinda feeling
(This here is my jam, turn it up)
Chilli peppper lights on all night
Spinning in records till we see the sunrise
Living like we're gonna live forever
Kinda feelin'
You might also likeI kinda like it
It feels good

Come on down no cover charge
Just chilling like a Nashville hippie
Driftwood fire rolling towards the sky
Whoa, that baccardi just hit me
Better chill right here in this lounge chair
Before we get a little too far out there

Well it's a sundown song, halfway to drunk
Hey wanna hang what you got in that cup
Kinda feeling
(Baby don't stop fill it up to the top)
It's a slow it on down, pass one around
Smoke in the air yeah we can all share
That kinda feeling
(This here is my jam, turn it up)
Chilli peppper lights on all night
Spinning in records till we see the sunrise
Living like we're gonna live forever
Kinda feelin'

If you got a cup
It's time to raise it
If you got a cup
It's time to get crazy (get loco)
Just come up and get a little hazy
If you got a cup
It's time to raise it
Well it's a sundown song, halfway to drunk
Hey wanna hang, what you got in that cup
That kinda feeling
(Oh what're you gonna see underneath this palm tree)
It's a slow it on down, pass one around
Smoke in the air yeah we can all share
That kinda feeling
(A little private party next to the water)
Chilli peppper lights on all night
Spinning in records till we see the sunrise
Living like we're gonna live forever
Kinda feelin'
I kinda like it
