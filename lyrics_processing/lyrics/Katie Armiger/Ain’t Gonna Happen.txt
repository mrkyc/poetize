You complete me
Yeah, right

If you were the sunshine I would stand in the rain
If you were a long day I would sleep it away
If you were a love song I'd hate to sing it
If you were the truth I'd never believe it

Ain't gonna happen as long as I'm breathing
As long as I'm walking on this earth
As long as it turns around, ain't gonna happen
Not in this lifetime, not in a million years
Will I ever take you back, oh no
It ain't gonna happen as long as I'm breathing

If you were a lesson I would never learn it
If you were a hundred dollar bill I would burn it
If you were a heart I'd wanna break it
If you were a smile I'd have to fake it

Ain't gonna happen as long as I'm breathing
As long as it turns around, ain't gonna happen
Not in this lifetime, not in a million years
Will I ever take you back, oh no
It ain't gonna happen as long as I'm breathing
You might also likeNo no no

Ain't gonna happen as long as I'm breathing
As long as it turns around, ain't gonna happen
Not in this lifetime, not in a million years
Will I ever take you back, oh no
It ain't gonna happen as long as I'm breathing

If you were water I'd die thirsty
If you were a long bath I'd stay dirty
If you were a memory I'd never remember
If you were July I'd be December
If you were my last wish I wouldn't wish it
If you were my lost dog I wouldn't miss it
If you were a good book I wouldn't read it
If you were a chocolate I wouldn't eat it
