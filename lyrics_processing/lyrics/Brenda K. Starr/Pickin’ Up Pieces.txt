Pickin' up pieces of my heart
(Ooh, yeah) pickin' up the pieces of our fantasy
Pickin' up pieces of my heart
I thought you believed in me
Like I believed in you
Never did occur to me
That I was only playing the fool
Now I want to (want to)
Take my love back
And all those memories
I need to (need to)
Never look back
Here's the way it's got to be, so I'm
Pickin' up the pieces of our broken dream
Pickin' up pieces of my heart
(Ooh, I'm) pickin' up the pieces of our fantasy
Pickin' up pieces of my heart
(Pickin' up, I'm pickin' up, pickin' up pieces)
(Pickin' up, I'm pickin' up, pickin' up pieces)
(Pickin' up, I'm pickin' up, pickin' up pieces)
(Pickin' up, I'm pickin' up, pickin' up pieces)

There's so much to do
In the mirror on the wall
You'll see the face from a crying fool

Ever look back
On all the memories

Never look back
It's the only way I see, so I'm
