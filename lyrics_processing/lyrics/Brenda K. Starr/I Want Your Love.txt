I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
Do you feel like you ever want
To try my love and see how well it fits?
Baby, can't you see when you look at me
That I can't get this feeling when it hits?
I'm all alone, I'm in my bed at night
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight
I think of you and I dream of you
All of the time, what am I gonna do, baby?
I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, I want your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love 'cause I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love 'cause I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, I want your love)
Sometimes do you feel
Like you never really had love that's real?
Well, here I am and who's to say?
A better love you won't find today
Just one chance and I will show you love
Like no other, two steps above
On your ladder, I'll be a peg
I want your love, boy, please don't make me beg

I'll share my dreams and make you see
(To share my dreams and make you see)
How really bad your love I need
(How really bad your love I need)
I want your love, I need your love
('Cause I want your love and I need your love)
Just like the birds need skies above
(Just like a bird in the skies above)
