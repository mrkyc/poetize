Going, going
Since a youngin, I've been flowing, flowing
Tryna find my way out of here
Doing it for the love, for politics
Soundtrack to the heart of it, made a art of it
Team Swell, still a part of it
Had to jump out the boat into the water
I wanted to be a baller but I didn't have a starter kit, nah
Eighteen years old
Signed a record deal with label Parlophone
Now we on the road to do an EP
And they even got a nigga on TV
Catch, Chiddy was really just tryna ball tho
And the industry I ain't really know it all tho
And the fans is like, what the fuck happened?
They been trying find a nigga like Waldo
If the shoe fits wear it like Aldo
They can't stop you from shining the way you are, bro
I've been listening to your music in the car, bro
Gotta keep it pushing, it was written in the stars tho, I know
You a hard act to follow
Lauryn Hill's first night at the Apollo
Like the Bulls without Mike in Chicago
Gotta have the team doing well like Fargo, get it!

I was a youth on a mission
Put the key in the ignition
They told me that I should quit
But I just wouldn't listen
This is my life and I'm playing my cards
Taking my chances and facing these odds
Stuck on the road with no place to call home
Had to just learn the whole game on my own, damn
Back to the drawing board
Jumping off the ship when they was all aboard
Shaking up the picture like a Polaroid
Now they actin' like they don't know the boy
But I'm back on the grind
Only luxury that we have is the time
Planted some seeds to make it out of my mom's
Now I'm back home, you can call it LeBron
Road less traveled, that be the path to take
Full speed ahead, don't mash the brakes
Fuck you for judging me for my past mistakes
'Cause I was cutting the grass and it had some snakes, like

I've been on my grind, I've been on my grind
I ain't gon' settle, I'm here to take what's mine
Money on my mind, pussy is a drug
