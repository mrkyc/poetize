"Welcome to the Swelly Express, can I help you?"
"Yeah, can I get two round trips to New York, please?"
"Sure, that'll be $48, cash or credit?"
"$48? Damn!"
"Uh, that'll be cash"
"Alright, thank you, your change is $2, departing from track 5"
"Thank you, it's a bus, I didn't know it was departing from track 5"
"Oh yeah"

Never chase girls, chase dreams first
Motion picture drive, I concluded that my dream works
So I pace right, never see my brake lights
Never trust a person but fam, too many great whites
Never work without merit, never live but don't cherish
'Cause we only born to perish
This is a luxury, tariff
Here to preach a brand new sermon, Eric, and it's hysteric
They say you too pretentious, don't get into that
Never the same, I went left like a Democrat
I would like to present you with this rap award
And I got more gigs than a Apple store
Ayo, you wilding, boy, you ain't even styling, boy
It's like I'm on a boat, feeling lonely on this island, boy
My life will never be the same
If never ever was, you'll probably feel my pain
You might also like
This is forever, this beat is on black pepper
You could get shook if you looking a little extra
Never fall off, just make it a little better
And when they think it's sunny, that's when we change up the weather
And when you say you better, I bet I'll say, "Never"
And if you say you better, I bet I'll say, "Never"
And when you say you better, I bet I'll say, "Never"
And if you say you better, I bet I'll say, "Never"

Uh, I never do as I'm supposed to
Give me the light, Sean Paul, '02
At homecoming, yeah, I went and brought my whole crew
I thought I killed it, though they could not hear my vocals, damn
And they say, "Why you roll that great stuff?"
I take a pull and wonder why the Beatles break up
Imagination is magic, so when I wake up
Feel like I'm looking out at Hogwarts
Would it be wrong to have meetings in my ball shorts?
The flow excessive like cops when they using what you call force
Xaph, this beat, you prolly should have brung to West
I swear I'm never like a nun when it comes to sex
And yeah, I p-p-p-p-poke her face, her best bet
Frequent flyer miles, yeah, I'm trying jet set
It's gonna take me higher, might even make me flyer
Life is a box of chocolates, so I prefer Godiva
This is forever, this beat is on black pepper
You could get shook if you looking a little extra
Never fall off, just make it a little better
And when they think it's sunny, that's when we change up the weather
And when you say you better, I bet I'll say, "Never"
And if you say you better, I bet I'll say, "Never"
And when you say you better, I bet I'll say, "Never"
