(Ray Charles)
Ooh boy, open your eyes
A girl like me ain't waitin' all night
Ooh boy, better think twice
I got that honey, that sugar, that spice (Ray Charles)
Ooh boy, open your eyes
A girl like me ain't waitin' all night
Ooh boy, better think twice
I got that honey, that sugar, that spice (Ray Charles)

Yeah, hey yo, I'm feelin' like Ray Charles
I got my shades on, I don't know where they are
You couldn't find me even if you had a radar
And I spit rapidly AK, AR
I make the music with the soul of a blind man
They be amazed how I get them ladies that cry, "yeah"
And they try to do it, but they're blind to the fact
That they're just stuck in a trap and stayin' right where they at
But I'm Ray Charles, Miss A calls
Talkin' to my dime and I miss 8 calls
And I spit tough, bet you I'ma last Great Wall
I'm goin' ape y'all, I'm the new Ray Charles

I don't need no walking stick, my shit cost a grip
I get out the mouthwash if you talkin' shit
And I can hear the evil, but I won't see it
And if the blunt go out, you better reheat it

I got my black shades on, smoke it 'til it's gone
Head to the sky, feelin' so on
Ray Charles, I-I'm Ray Charles
Ray Charles, I-I'm Ray Charles (Ray Charles)
I got my black J's on, dancin' to my song
Lookin' so fly, feelin' so gone
I'm Ray Charles, I-I'm Ray Charles
I'm Ray Charles, I-I'm Ray Charles (Ray Charles)

Ooh boy, open your eyes
A girl like me ain't waitin' all night
Ooh boy, better think twice
I got that honey, that sugar, that spice

Yeah, and I think I'm preheated, oven
They hear me spit, they think they know me like their cousin
But it's okay, we at the door that means we're buzzin'
Now that's McDonald's and baby I think I'm lovin', it
But you know that size doesn't fit
MC Hammer with this shit, like why the fuck would I quit?
Let's hire 40 people and get like 40 cars
And I wouldn't even drive cause I would be Ray Charles
See us and say, "What up?" like, how the fuck is he talkin'?
He don't even trip, like how the fuck is he walkin'?
I'm blind, man, yeah, like the Three Blind Mice
And them haters, I'ma throw it on 'em
Tell 'em I don't need no walkin' stick, my shit cost a grip
I get out the mouthwash if you talkin' shit
And I can hear the evil, but I won't see it
And if the blunt go out, you better reheat it

I got my black shades on, smoke it 'til it's gone
Head to the sky, feelin' so on
Ray Charles, I-I'm Ray Charles
Ray Charles, I-I'm Ray Charles (Ray Charles)
I got my black J's on, dancin' to my song
Lookin' so fly, feelin' so gone
I'm Ray Charles, I-I'm Ray Charles
I'm Ray Charles, I-I'm Ray Charles (Ray Charles)

Ooh boy, open your eyes
A girl like me ain't waitin' all night
Ooh boy, better think twice
I got that honey, that sugar, that spice (Ray Charles)

You're too blind to see it
