Xaphoon, you crazy

Can I rock to this rhyme?
You're not on my mind
They say we blowing up
Don't jump on our mine
I once had a tie to the world, I was blind
Now I see everything through these contacts of mine
I'm at the office, yeah, I does it again
I touch it, it wins, that's why the label buzzing me in, uh
Told my mama I won't stop 'til I'm signed
I'm hot with the rhyme, you Megatron, I'm Optimus Prime
I'm locked in a line, I'm just waiting for my turn
Still fresh to death, so this paper I gotta earn
I am stern, David commissioned me for athleticism
The prototype on the mic, just check my mechanism
They ask, "How you make the world feel it?"
I say it's D-N-A, it's just in my double helix
My controversions sells, if controversy sells
Then I'ma take this 9, shoot the president and bail, uh
Not Barack, though I love ya
You in a lower weight class, I'm above ya
Can I get this? Guarantee I spit this
Hand on the stand, I guarantee you should witness
Yeah, the boy back like retro
I want my car to have NOS like Esco
I'm in the class in the corner, I'm special
The flow magic, magic, presto
I take off, before it, I break off
Perfect attendance, I'm never taking days off
And while I put in work, they getting a laid off
And this is based off, flow
I'm feeling like I'm near cash, on drive, so I steer fast
Don't they feel my impact like a deer crash
Promised Aunty if I win, you see it's right
Make the rain go away like a windshield wipe
I'm ripe, I'm raw, I'm everything above
A big enough heart to give a hater a hug
Shooting off whether its grenades or a slug
