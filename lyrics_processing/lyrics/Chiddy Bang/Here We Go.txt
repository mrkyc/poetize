Here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go

Here we go
Them other rap dudes ain't near me though
This that shit for your stereo
Hit Louis Vuitton, yeah we go
Back at ya, spectacular
Flip shit 'round here, no spatula
The way they bite my shit like Dracula
And if the shorty fine, then I get back to her
And I love this game like Mario
But my flow is just like cardio
Intensive, offensive
And they ask why your belt expensive
They can't see me even if they had lenses
Top lonely, give a fuck about friendses
'Cause I'm a lonely stoner, pop Corona
College dropout, no diploma
You might also like
If you feel the heat in the kitchen
Or just washing dishes
Or dancin' for tuition
With the big dreams and wishes
Don't stop to listen
Just keep tryna get it
'Cause you gon' get there
Put your hands in the air and say

Here we go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Here we go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Here we go, we go, we go-oh-oh
Here we go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And I think I'll have the last laugh and I'll pass class
Told them I was done with it
Opposite of adult, let's have fun with it
I'm a genius, and so is Xaphoon
Stay up, nocturnal shit, raccoon
Rap soon, holla at you later
They say we bound to blow up, Al-Qaeda
And this track was just a favor
That turned into a classic, hater
I run rap like a master dater
You take forever to make a procrastinator
Blind niggas can't see shit
And he a story of Victoria Secret
That's only if she keep it
Never mistake kindness for weakness
If you feel the heat in the kitchen
Or just washing dishes
Or dancin' for tuition
With the big dreams and wishes
Don't stop to listen
Just keep tryna get it
'Cause you gon' get there
Put your hands in the air and say

Here we go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Here we go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Here we go, we go, we go-oh-oh
Here we go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

A hater tried to stop me on my way, today
I got to get my move, get out the way, my way, my way

Here we go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Here we go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Here we go, we go, we go-oh-oh
Here we go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Here we go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Here we go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Here we go, we go, we go-oh-oh
Here we go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Here we go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Here we go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Here we go, we go, we go-oh-oh
