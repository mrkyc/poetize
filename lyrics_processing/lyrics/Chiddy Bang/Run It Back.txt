We the winners tell em' run it back
Problems money come with that
I just ease the pain by chopping trees like a lumberjack
Thundercat, you ain't even ready for my summer raps
Coolin' on a minute I'm in to take the world, yeah I'm finna
It's young kidster, ain't no body hotter than
Soon as I step in the building, shit she forgot her man
College ran to the point I had to leave, was not a fan
Maybe a little, now my email get a lot of spam
I'mma wild out, basically
That means I probably don't care about what you say to me
I got a couple bad bitches, Lord, pray for me
Look in the mirror we the shit that they pray to be
And cater to me
Roll the blunts make a mixed drink
And don't you dare say that I ever care what a bitch think
She ain't a single but for me she tryna lip sync
And once the lips link, now that's instinct

We on Cloud 9, welcome to the mothership
Second verse is dedicated to bitches that's medicated
Off the pine tree, and she a dime piece
If I forgot you then make sure that you remind me
I'm only partly here until I see my guy Z (?)
When I cheef, so is you down to get lizzit
And livin', our lifestyle, they are so addictin'
I said they always be amazed how I rap fly
Hey yo, my eyes is currently upon your backside
Why? I stay gone off the loud perp
They gonna drop you if ever try to crowd-surf
I touch em all, they say my style hurts
I get your number but I'm never gonna dial first
But I'm lovin' that
Go have fun with that
'Fore I jump out the window, I tell 'em "run it back"
