Yeah
Look what we have here
Hero

And everything ain't what it seems
And this is for the people that's chasing they dreams
Get your money hustle up
So could you get your money hustle up
But don't let them take it, rules we break it
Tryna get it 'cause we overachieve
Momma I made it, now they hate it
But you could trust they got nothing on we
They got nothing on we

And everybody needs a hero
Just another number, they rather you be a zero
But you could make it out, be patient with no surgery
Somebody call 9-1-1, it's an emergency
The kids need a hero, let us get bread
They follow everything, they seein' and embed in they head
Custodian clean, get Banks, bring Cody in
And I know that you probably into that Nickelodeon
They gon' watch it on that TV screen
And when you sleep, remember it and retrieve these dreams
We livin' the good life, we don't need these fiends
And when we focus it's easier than a free throw seems
Cousins without clothes, tell 'em keep those jeans
Pausin' and time froze, now we beat those teams
Victorious, and can we bring this to the chor-e-us
And sure he is a boy meetin' world like Cory is
You might also like
And everything ain't what it seems
And this is for the people that's chasing they dreams
Get your money hustle up
So could you get your money hustle up
But don't let them take it, rules we break it
Tryna get it 'cause we overachieve
Momma I made it, now they hate it
But you could trust they got nothing on we
They got nothing on we

And you can tell they got nothin' on we
And you can tell they got nothin' on we
You can tell they got nothin' on we
You can tell they got nothin' on we
And you can tell they got nothin' on we

And if you dream it, you could grab it
When obstacles arrive you drive past it
I learned there's more to life when we had a smash hit
And the only thing guaranteed in life is a casket
That's why I live it up
They try to rob me of my dreams, they told me give it up
Uh, I said I refuse, this journey I pursue
And what I do to haters, I made them my own muse
Kinda funny, I'm amused
They say your mind is the most powerful thing to use
But I hope it's just powerful as the Pope is
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley, like Ford I got focus
Yeah, see you could do it if you follow it
Look into the stars, they shootin' with no hollow tips
And it isn't what it seems
So, just like Yeezy, we steady gettin' out our dreams
That's G.O.O.D
And everything ain't what it seems
And this is for the people that's chasing they dreams
Get your money hustle up
So could you get your money hustle up
But don't let them take it, rules we break it
Tryna get it 'cause we overachieve
Momma I made it, now they hate it
But you could trust they got nothing on we
They got nothing on we

And you can tell they got nothin' on we
And you can tell they got nothin' on we
You can tell they got nothin' on we
You can tell they got nothin' on we
