I done been around the world
Real shit, had a thousand girls
Real shit, finna shine like pearls, I know it
I'ma come through in the clutch and show it
Focused on this paper route
I wake up in the morning and chase it
Started at the bottom
Now there's lb's on my bracelet
Take off in a spaceship
G-Give it a try
Picture me picking a prize
Ask me why I get so high
We living to die
My limit's the sky
And everybody now we gotta have it
Yeah, we gotta have it
And I get this paper
I'm a turn to a savage
Just like Randy
They can't stand me
All my hoes chase 'cause my house change
Undertaker, my flow caine
Yeah, you know I got bite, dog
Yeah, you know I spit propane
Yeah, you know she gon' throw it back
Y-Yeah, you know it's straight Kodak
'Cause this life for the picture
I came back with a verse from the Bible
And I write from the scripture

I'm in this bitch like "fuck that"
Head spinning like hub caps
And we not gonna land
And I'm hot like a pan
Motherfuckers can't touch that
Where the hell did my friends go
I'm sipping on Cliquot
And I'm sticking to the G-code
A hundred dollar smoking, weed rolled
We cold
Dre had dreams of living this life
F-ing the world, giving her pipe
Forecast, champagne showers
This time, the game ours
Kobe with that fade
We sold out in L.A
Got that contract to get paid
My million dollar plan made
Said "yeah, I gotta get it" (Every time we touch)
So promise I'm gon' get it
Get this money for momma (I can feel your heart beat)
Take it back to the crib and then split it
Yeah, you know that we did it
Back on the committee
Fuck all of that bullshit
'Cause that bullshit, we ain't with it
Young nigga!
