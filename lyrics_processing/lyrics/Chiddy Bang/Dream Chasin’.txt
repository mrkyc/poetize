"Alright guys, good shit today at the label, I think it went well"
"Yo, I'm tired as hell"
"Yeah, well, we got a long ass ride home, so you gotta get some sleep on the bus"
"We'll try to"
"We got that show tomorrow, so make sure you get that rest, alright?"
"Alright"
"Before you miss that bus, the last one tonight, try not to sleep at my house"
"Alright, man"
"Meet you tomorrow"

Ay, check the plans out
We work hard, I ain't asking for a handout
If I hit the booth, I don't have to pass them grams out
And be the well when the other thoughts ran out
They say they lost words, I got 'em puzzled like the crossword
Harvard, I'm nuts, George Washington Carver
But you can never pay a boss peanuts
If it gets messy, be prepared for the cleanup
But this thing called success is so strange
'Cause you can get notoriety and still ride the train
Make it in its entirety and search for the fame
But I'm still Michael Phelps, swimming in my lane
Where's Lois? Me, I'm Superman, I'm just here to save the day
Or at least I thought I was, 'til I
Flew in to save her and I met my opponent
I'm fighting with myself, don't offer the condolence, I'm dreaming
You might also like
We chasing the dream
So what is life? The diamonds and the gleam
Get a job while I'm doing it, promise to stay true in it, doing it
But never let another soul ruin it
And things ain't what it seem
Make money to spend it, I got my scheme
Work hard while we doing it, promise to stay true in it, doing it
But never let another soul ruin it

It's too haunting, the task is daunting
Tryna get the labels on board while flaunting
But let's make some music, make some money, get the rides
European ties, have models for wives
Sometimes I feel fated to pretend
Unsafe, 'cause my crib is far from gated in
I'm a relic, believe slightly the psychedelic
If I could take off, would you consider me angelic?
Hysteric, I'm the subject and the predicate
They hating on me, tell me where's the etiquette
If you Goliath, I don't need to prove I'm better than
I play David, I'm a fourth-year letter man
So Letterman, can't you hear me knocking on the door?
Hard to breathe at this altitude where oxygen is poor
Think Benz, I don't know what Pontiac means
And this is what happens when an insomniac dreams
We chasing the dream
So what is life? The diamonds and the gleam
Get a job while I'm doing it, promise to stay true in it, doing it
But never let another soul ruin it
And things ain't what it seem
Make money to spend it, I got my scheme
Work hard while we doing it, promise to stay true in it, doing it
