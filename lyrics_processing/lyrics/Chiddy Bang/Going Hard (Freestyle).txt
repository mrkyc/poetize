Hey! Listen

Uh, yeah, hey've been raw
I'm in my hotel on filet mignon
When Breakfast dropping, I'm Lexus shopping
And once my album drops, I'ma probably be necklace-copping
Clean ass record but feel like the feds is watching
I'm a motherfucking bad boy, Dennis Rodman
And I don't bleach my hair, my reach ain't fair
You're irrational but I'm international
And I'ma step my shit up until my status catapult
And your opinion doesn't matter, you don't have a vote
But here's a big fat dick for haters to have a choke
'Cause wrong or prone, situation's ugly like an ogre though
I'm just on my starship with these cobra flows
Big shout to my older bro
I was next Hov, Sean album dropped
Quiet as fuck but wishing that I could have his spot
Yeah, guess we'll all sit back and watch
I don't just jump in the booth, nigga, I rabbit hop
An avid pot smoker so I'ma grind up every batch
I'm upfront with her instead of in the back
Let her see the seats, watch her change her speech
Once she realize that it's wood, all my shit then will be good
Got the kind of shit to just excite her
911, tell her we can catch fire, yeah
It's nothing worse than a bitch fighter
Yeah, it's nothing worse than a hitchhiker
And she in Team Swell but only if Chids like her
I'm a dog, I'm a Rotty
I'm Roddy, I'm a Piper (Hard)
Yeah, steady going hard like that Ke$ha chick
Let's admit, I be out in London shopping at Suffragettes (Hard)
Longest rap, I got the wildest title
Smoking out in France, I thought I was on the Eiffel (Hard)
I don't want your car, that's a salvage title
Used to watch wrestling, Vince was my idol (Hard)
So tell them bitches pay-per-view, she would fuck a Laker too
But she like, "I love you, Chiddy, I would fucking pay for you"
Recess, tell them hoes they should play for you
You gotta go but they all willing to stay for you
Fast life, flash life; man, ain't it true?
Shout to Tiana, Biggie said it's what the game will do
I'm banging through never afflicted
I'm the future, motherfuckers could never predict it
In the building, motherfucker, I'm never evicted
Team Swell captain forever enlisted
I'm out for my biscuits
Yeah, out for the biscuit
Throw a javelin, discus
Cumulonimbus, yeah
Be nimble, be still
We will take over
Give the whole game a makeover
Telling whole chicks to stay over
You might also like
Yeah, I'm done
Team Swell, ho
All's Swell that ends Swell
Saved by the Swell
Duke Swellington (Hard), ha
We crazy man, hard (Hard)
And that's all, that's all you gon' get for now (Hard)
