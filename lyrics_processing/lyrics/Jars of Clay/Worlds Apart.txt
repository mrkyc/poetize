I am the only one to blame for this
Somehow it all ends up the same
Soaring on the wings of selfish pride
I flew too high
And like Icarus I collide

With a world I try so hard to leave behind
To rid myself of all but love
To give and die

To turn away and not become
Another nail to pierce the skin
Of One who loves
More deeply than the oceans
More abundant than the tear
Of a world embracing every heartache

Can I be the one to sacrifice
Or grip the spear and watch the blood
And water flow

(To love you) Take my world apart
(To need you) I am on my knees
(To love you) Take my world apart
(To need you) Broken on my knees
You might also like
All said and done I stand alone
Amongst remains of a life I should not own
It takes all I am to believe
In the mercy that covers me

Did You really have to die for me
All I am for all You are
'Cause what I need and what I believe
Are worlds apart
And I pray

(To love you) Take my world apart
(To need you) I am on my knees
(To love you) Take my world apart
(To need you) Broken on my knees
On my knees

I look beyond the empty cross
Forgetting what my life has cost
And wipe away the crimson stains
And dull the nails that still remain
More and more I need you now
I owe you more each passing hour
Battle between grace and pride
I gave up not so long ago

So steal my heart and take the pain
And wash the feet and cleanse my pride
Take the selfish, take the weak
And all the things I cannot hide

Take the beauty, take my tears
Sin and soul, heart, make it yours
Take my world all
Take it now, take it now

And serve the ones that I despise (To love you)
Speak the words I can't deny (Take my world apart)
Watch the world I used to love (To need you)
Fall to dust and blow away (I am on my knees)

I look beyond the empty cross (To love you)
Forgetting what my life has cost (Take my world apart)
And wipe away the crimson stains (To need you)
And dull the nails that still remain (Broken on my knees)
So steal my heart and take the pain (To need you)
Take the selfish, take the weak
And all the things I cannot hide (To need you)
Take the beauty, take my tears (On my knees / To need you)

Take my world apart, take my world apart
And I pray (To love you)
And I pray, and I pray (On my knees)
Take my world apart
