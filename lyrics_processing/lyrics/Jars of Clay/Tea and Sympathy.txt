Fare thee well
Trade in all our words for tea and sympathy
Wonder why we tried, for things could never be
Play our heart's lament
Like an unrehearsed symphony

Not intend
To leave this castle full of empty rooms
Our love the captive in the tower never rescued
And all the victory songs
Seemed to be playing out of tune

'Cause it's not the way
That it has to be
Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy, no
And it's not the way
That it has to be

You begin
All your words fall to the floor and break like china cups
And the waitress grabs a broom and tries to sweep them up
I reach for my tea
Slowly drink in
You might also like
And it's not the way
That it has to be
Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy, no
And it's not the way
That it has to be
Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy

(Don't trade)
Yeah
(Don't trade)
(Don't trade)
(Don't trade)

Fare thee well
The words, the bag of leaves that fill my head
I could taste the bitterness
And call the waitress instead
'Cause she holds the answer
Smiles and asks one teaspoon or two

'Cause it's not the way
That it has to be
Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy, no
And it's not the way
That it has to be
Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy
It's not the way
That it has to be
Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy, no
'Cause it's not the way
That it has to be
Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy
Yeah
No
Don't trade us for tea and sympathy
(Don't trade us for tea and sympathy)
Don't trade us for tea and sympathy
We can work it out
Don't trade us for tea and sympathy
(Don't trade us for tea and sympathy)
Don't trade us for tea and sympathy
We can work it out
Yeah
Oh
