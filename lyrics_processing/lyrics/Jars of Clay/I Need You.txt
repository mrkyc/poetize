Strangely out of place
There's a light filling this room where none would follow before
I can't deny it burns me up inside
I fan the flames to melt away my pride
Do I want shelter from the rain or the rain to wash me away?

I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you
You're all I'm living for

I might sound like a fool, but I think I felt you moving closer to me
Face to the ground to hide the fatal cut
I fight the weight, I feel You lift me up
You are the shelter from the rain and the rain to wash me away

I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you
(You're all I'm living for)
I need you, I need you, I need you
You're all I'm living for (all I'm living for)
All I'm living for (all I'm living for)
You're all I'm living for
You might also like
Face to the ground to hide the fatal cut
I fight the weight, feel You lift me up
I can't deny it burns me up inside
I fan the flames to melt away my pride
Only have a second to spare
But all the time in the world to know you're there
You are the shelter from the rain and the rain to wash me away

I need you, I need you, I need you (all I'm living for)
I need you, I need you, I need you (all I'm living for)
I need you, I need you, I need you
You're all I'm living for (all I'm living for)
All I'm living for (all I'm living for)
You're all I'm living for (all I'm living for)
All I'm living for (all I'm living for)
