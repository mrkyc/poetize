Took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
Stuck a lovin' 44 beneath my head
Woke up next morning grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
I made a good run but I went too slow
They over took me down in Juarez, Mexico
Sittin in the hop joint smoking my fill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said "Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown'
Why you're the dirty hog that shot your woman down
Yes, oh yes my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
Shot her cold how she made me sore
I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more
Put me on the train I was dressed in black
Lost the sheriff man it brought me back
Had no one to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail
And next morning along about nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
And he coughed as he cleared his throat
Come on you dirty hop into the district court
You might also likeInto the court room the trial began
Where I was paneled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw the little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I thought, "Oh lordy lordy have mercy on me"
The judge smiled as he picked u his pen
Ninety-nine years in that old San Quentin pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I'll never forget the day I shot my woman down
Come on you hops and listen up to me
