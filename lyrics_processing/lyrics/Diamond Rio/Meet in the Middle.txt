It was seven hundred fence posts from your place to ours
Neither one of us was old enough to drive a car
Sometimes it was rainin', sometimes it would shine
We wore out that gravel road between your house and mine

I'd start walkin' your way, you'd start walkin' mine
We'd meet in the middle, 'neath that old Georgia pine
We'd gain a lot of ground, 'cause we'd both give a little
There ain't no road too long when we meet in the middle

It's been seven years tomorrow since we said our vows
Under that old pine tree, you ought to see it now
Standin' in the backyard, remindin' me and you
That if we don't see eye to eye, there's somethin' we can do

I'd start walkin' your way, you'd start walkin' mine
We'd meet in the middle, 'neath that old Georgia pine
We'd gain a lot of ground, 'cause we'd both give a little
There ain't no road too long when we meet in the middle

Babe, I love the way we work it out
That's what love is all about
