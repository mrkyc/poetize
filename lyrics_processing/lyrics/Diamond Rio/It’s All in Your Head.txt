In a home for wayward girls
Daddy was sidewalk, soapbox preacher
Looking forward to the end of the world
Every Friday night he'd pick a Jesus fight
Down at the local pool hall
Racking up souls condemning all those
Caught behind the eight ball
He said I preach for the light - the light shows the way
Don't ever trust what the government say
We never walked on the moon
Elvis ain't dead
You ain't going crazy
It's all in your head
Lucy was a messed up, dressed up waitress
With a slightly tarnished heart of gold
She wasn't half bad for a new step momma
As far as step momma's go
Daddy knew she was the one as he baked in the sun
In a parking lot preaching the truth
Up shot her hand and she cried, oh, man
I feel it, yes, I feel it I do
It's been revealed to me down deep in my soul
There were two shooters on the grassy knoll
We never walked on the moon
Elvis ain't dead
You ain't going crazy
It's all in your head

To find the truth you gotta read between the lines
Work out your own salvation
That narrow path is hard to define
Heaven's more than a place
It's a state of mind
In his quest for truth
Daddy was moved by the spirit
To take up a snake
In a moment of doubt the venom turned out
Stronger than daddy's faith
But I'll never forget his dying breath
The last words that he said
We never walked on the moon
Elvis ain't dead
You ain't going crazy
It's all in your head
Let me tell ya
It's all interpretation
To find the truth you gotta read between the lines
Work out your own salvation
That narrow path is had to define
Heaven's more than a place
It's a state of mind
