Going out of my mind these days
Like I'm walking 'round in a haze
I can't think straight, I can't concentrate
And I need a shave

I go to work and I look tired
The boss man says, "Son you're gonna get fired, this ain't your style"
And from behind my coffee cup I just smile

What a beautiful mess
What a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
'Cause I can't get enough
Can't stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Ahhh

This morning put salt in my coffee
I put my shoes on the wrong feet
I'm losing my mind, I swear; it might be the death of me
But I don't care

There's nothing else I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
'Cause I can't get enough
Can't stop the hunger for your love
What a beautiful, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Ahhh

Is it your eyes is it your smile
All I know is that you're driving me wild

What a beautiful mess
What a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing else I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
'Cause I can't get enough
Can't stop the hunger for your love
(What a beautiful)
