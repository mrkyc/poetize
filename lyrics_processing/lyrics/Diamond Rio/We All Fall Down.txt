You know the monkey bar rules
As she kisses away his playground bruise
You don't have to skip a bar each time
To make it to the other side
She picked him up out of the sand
And tied the shoelace that read superman
(chorus)
We all fall down
It's the getting back up that really counts
We live and we learn
To help someone up when it's their turn
And life there's only one garuntee
You're feet won't always be on the ground
Cause we all fall down
She says. . 
I know what you're going through
She talks through the door of her daughter's room
Your heart feels like it broken in two
Well Baby I'm here for you
The door opened and she stepped inside
She put her arms around her and said
"It's okay to cry"

We all fall down
It's the getting back up that really counts
We live and we learn
To help someone up when it's their turn
And life there's only one garuntee
You're feet won't always be on the ground
Cause we all fall down
He's 45 and his job is gone
He's at his desk then heads on home
He sees his kids out playing in the yard
It's been a while since he's been hit so hard
He's as scared as a man can be
He tells his wife and she says
"Honey look at me"
(chorus)
We all fall down
It's the getting back up that really counts
We live and we learn
To help someone up when it's their turn
And life there's only one garuntee
You're feet won't always be on the ground
Cause we all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
