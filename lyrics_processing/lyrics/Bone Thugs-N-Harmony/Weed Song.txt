Take me
Higher, higher, baby
Can you feel it?? (Feel it, feel it, feel it)
Do you feel the same weed high that I feel??
'Cause I'm so high (Reefer makes you feel that way)
And I feeling so right
Roll (roll), let's smoke, I got to get high
I been high since the last song (Off that la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
And I just been smokin' and smokin'
Smoke another blunt, roll another up
You know that weed can really ease your mind
Every time I smoke good reefer that endo high makes me fly
If everybody smoked a blunt, relieve the mind, the world could
Be a better place
If everybody took a break and we all just got wasted
Toked out (Out, out out), smoked out (Out, out, out)
Choked out (Out, out, out), pull another O (Out, out, out)
Let's get P-O-D-ded (P-O-D-ded, P-O-D-ded)

The weed can't get no better (no better baby)

20 dollar hollars all day, every day
Come around my way, you gon' want to stay
Weed makes me hungry, happy, and all I can say
Sure I need some more
Don't make we wait, stay awake, fake sleep
Got the weed between the sheets, catch me
Mary J. blessed me
Open up the dime, stimulate your mind, slide my thumb up the blunt
Open up and what you'll find in there (You don't really want)
I never been in High Times (Never been in High Times)
I never been in High Times
But can you tell me that I've been so high all my life
Am I high enough (Am I high enough)
Am I high enough (Am I high enough)

I remember being a little thug
Weed, really didn't know what it was
Then I took a puff and I realized
I should always, stay high
The weed (the weed), makes me feel alright (alright)
If you feel like I feel, I got half on yo dime
If you got weed smoke it
I'm a real weed smoker
If it's mine then I would
Since its yours you could, you should
If I ain't there when you blaze a blunt nigga
Huh, please think of me
'Cause you know I nigga like to get high (high)
High and free
Smokin' all night, feelin' all right
Bone Thugs get high, so high
High, high, all night, high, high
So high

Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh, my my my my
I know you wonder why I do it
Love the sky and I soar up so high
This mornin' I woke in my bed
Bangin' and ringin' inside my head
I wanted to make love to you baby
But last night I got P-O-Ded instead
So please don't go away, that's all I got to say
Is I gotta have you Mary J
Such a heavenly feelin' I get
When I'm taking fat ass blunts to the brain
Oh darlin' I'm goin insane, and I really wish we can
Kick it at home in America, like it was on in Amsterdam
You heard enough, you heard it all, nothin' but a, a really thug nigga
Nothin' less than a killa, I'm out in front makin' my scrilla
I'm happy to know, the slide is the ball, and kick as strong as me
You rippin' the bong like me, can't hit it as long as me
And when I need to free my mind
I can find, satisfaction in a bag of weed
Everything I need, leave it to the trees
It can make me feel better
And every day I wake, niggas rollin' up blunts
And mo blunts, and mo blunts
And I keep a case of Swisher Sweets in the trunk
So when I'm rollin', smokin', chokin', just floatin'
Through the city in my drop-top
Glock cocked, rollin', just rollin'
Me and mary jane
Its my world, its my thang
The way she penetrates my brain
Buddah, done blessed me with game
Good game, you wanna chop it up
We can kick it, smoke a fatty to the dome
Nigga lay high, thugged out
Smokin' all night, long

The weed can't get no better (No better, baby)
The weed can't get no better (No better, baby)
The weed can't get no better (No better, baby)
