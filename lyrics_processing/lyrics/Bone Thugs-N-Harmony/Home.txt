I been stuck in the struggle
And I been wonderin' if I'm ever gon' bubble
I'm gettin' caught up in a tussle 'stead of usin' my muscle
And every time I extend my heart to my mother
Caught up in the game, now I'm back up in the hustle
Sometimes I sit and I wonder
If a nigga pull my number if it wasn't for the Bone Thug fam
In this world where nobody don't give a damn
But I'm still a man, got us all programmed
I'ma pump my fist, I'm stayin' ready for this
And you can put this on Wish, I never see the abyss
And when I needed a ride, you wouldn't give me a lift
And now I'm poppin' my Cris, you niggas all on my dick
I wanna change the world, you wanna change your life
I wouldn't a put up a fight if I knew it was trite
They say everything happen for a reason
Can you tell me why there's niggas bleedin'?
Needin' general assistance
Out here needin' public housing
Out here tryna make ends meet
Tryna get on their feet, but see, your brain is so cloudy
And I know what you don't know
You better get on your mission and get down for your dough
See, the real niggas ready out here takin' control
See, I'm screamin' out Mo', with my pockets on swole
Please Mr. Postman
Quit bringin' these bills to my house
Quit bringin' this stress to my spouse
'Cause I'm ready for the kill on look out, look out
If you niggas try to run up on the Bone
I'ma show you like this, I'ma pull out my chrome
I don't wanna have to send a nigga home
Lord, please take me home, come and take me home

'Cause I don't remember

Home (Home), home (Home), home (Home)
Home (Home), home (Home), please take me home

When I'm lookin' at my money now
Thinkin' backward to when I was livin' foul
I was runnin' wild, surviving
Hustle nine-to-five
And even put in overtime if I had to grind
I was stayin' up, slangin' dubs, hangin' up on the block
Duckin' and dodgin' the cops clocked doin' the night shift
Didn't think I'd ever make it out, out, out of the ghetto
But we finally made it
Stayed dedicated to the music we made, yeah
Now it's on Bone Thug, leavin' on
Came back the next year, number one, Platinum song
It blew up from the door and what do you know? (Oh no)
Eazy, rest his soul
Left us in a mess, I don't regret it
But we better get up and get it, go
Everything's gone wrong
Since you left Bone, it never been right
I knew it woulda been on, we woulda been tight
We woulda been in the zone, ridin' so high
Up in the game, five thugs live
See, we used to love makin' music
We was always in the studio, groovin'
We kept it movin', we was ready to do it
Right? But you know I'm goin' through it
And ain't feelin' this rap thing right now
They got me trippin', ready to flip
They got me trippin', ready to come get my chips
They got me trippin', loadin' the clips
They trippin', Lord, I feel like I'm losin' it
Right now, right now, now, now
So take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember

I'll never give in, I'll never give up
I let 'em live it, they sinnin', they pretend to be tough
Pretend to be tough, pretend to be blessed
They want money and women, it's never enough, they in a rush
Hope nobody knows just too much, you better be good
You know I'm from the hood, and so, we get 'em the dough
Ride out, laughin' up
When niggas died, niggas brought around nasty junk
And to the grave, I been one of the brave, not one of the slaves
I'm one of the paid and I'll be one of the same
Stay hazed and amazed by the television
Run around tellin' niggas we better behave
God in the place and they grins right up under my face
I steady debate the pain that I bring with hate
Sweet as the cake, I take another puff and shake
The smell of right it's all about heartache, hard to break
Lost mommy, poppy left home
I miss Wish Uncle Charlie
Sit listenin' in the back, and I'm tellin' his selection, his gain is probably
Probably my mind in the zone
Cryin' for the life of you gone
Just me and my destiny, let's roll, let's roll
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember

When I lost my Uncle Charles, a part of me went wrong
And then it happened when the Bone was comin' up so strong
We just wanted him to see what we do
You motivated us at the shows we seen you
And I really hope you live through what we spit on the song
You mighta been through somethin', hopin' nothin' like Bone
Like one said we'll never make it
Like two, thirty mil in they faces
And I really thought it was over, put us on and you left
Crossed over, back to the hood, we soldiers
The music thing, I make it back scandalous
But faith kicked in and award shows that we winnin' now
Gotta keep it comin' food in my baby mouth
And things have changed like relationships
Ain't did nothin', now you wanna flip
Suin' people, thangs you would've never made on your own
Now I wanna stay, watch thug niggas leave the hood, buy bigger homes
Stick in the hood, mess with scrubs, it'll all be gone
You can really help a busta if it ain't meant to be
With a little ooh-wee, with a little ooh-wee
I'm tired of tryin' to help these thugs
Lord, just guide em' home, guide 'em home

So take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home (Oh, Lord)
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
