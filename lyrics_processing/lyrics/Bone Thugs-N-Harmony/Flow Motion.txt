Layzie Bone is in the house, I'm gettin' it starrrted up
And it's my parrrt of the cut to let you know
That the harrrder the nuts, the harrrder you're stuck
I get the gauge, and let it blast and get you shot
And then you drop, you're popped
So now I got to free the block
I'm breakin' 'em, takin' 'em, makin' 'em
Fakin' 'em, shakin' 'em off to a new height
I rocks the mic, yes, I'm hype
I love to write, so don't you bite
Yeah, I'm the Bone, the nigga that's on the microphone
You shoulda known, you're fuckin' with me, yeah, it's on
'Cause I got Krayzie, and Bizzy Bone without a doubt
Wish Bone, and my bigger brother Stan Howse
So call your posse, you gon' need 'em
When the Bone's approachin', 'cause I be doin' it flow motion

We never get caught whenever we run, because we throw bolo
I'm hypin' 'em up, and strikin' 'em up to keep 'em in flow mo
You step and you're stuck
Now, what in the fuck is up with this dumb shit?
I'm packin' a 9 most all of the time, now back up, bitch!
I'm locked down all the time because I might go psycho
For drinkin' that Cisco, and poppin' my pistol
You're claimin' you're rough, I'm callin' your bluff
So, what's up, sucka?
I'm callin' my niggas and pullin' them triggers
Quick than a mothafucka

A 187, a lesson, for the niggas who think they get with the Bone
The weapon is kept in a trench and
So give me the gat, at once you're shown
There's nothin' flow like flow mo
I roll with the Bone, no, never go solo
Time and time again, think I'mma need for smoke 'em
So, so, no, no, 'cause I don't think that Biz will ever back down
You cross our ways, so you sing, then you chill in the background
I'm psycho, like no Leatherface, is no one on my level
Let's meet at the cemetery, and no, don't forget the shovels
I'm diggin' a ditch
For the sucka who thought that they could fade me
Chillin' with my nigga Wish, Layzie and Krayzie
The gauge be pointed at your temple in our land
My F-L-O-M-O-T-I-O-N can
Flow, flow, flow, flow, flow, flow, flow, flow

Well, it's the nigga, the nigga, the nigga, the once again
And niggas they pick up the pen and they try to contend
See, all that they win is a MAC-10
It's blastin', pick up my gun
And you're runnin' now from the assassin
Pumpin' the clip and you askin'
"Who in the fuck was that masked man?"
The nigga that pulled the trigga
'Cause I'm slimmer they figured they bigger
But when you can see the real killer is peelin' your cap
Come with the nigga that's runnin' the pack
They step, so pack the gat, tossin' your life
I proceed with the murders
Servin' ya off in a coffin, you're fucked
'Cause your niggas, they heard that I buck
So, don't think you'll win when I got my steel
And I'm feelin it, when you feelin' a pain
Well, like I'm insane
And know I can throw the gauge if you complain
There's never another to go with a brother
While smotherin' suckers been goin' undercover
We leave 'em in gutters, ain't goin' to get caught
But who was the sucka that's squealed on a murder?
Well, 187 the weapon is kept and
You step and get learned a lesson
I grab my Smith & Wesson for punks that run to test and
So punks get ready to drop
'Cause I'm on a roll and you'll get smoked, and
I'm kickin' a gangsta twist
Let's keep 'em movin' in flow motion
I flow (flow) when I go (go) in flow mo (mo)
I flow (flow) when I go (go) in flow mo (mo)
I flow (flow) when I go (go) in flow mo (mo)
