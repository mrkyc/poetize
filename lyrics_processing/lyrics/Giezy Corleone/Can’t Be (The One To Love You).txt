If it ain't 'bout money don't call me
Ya dig, yeah (major move)

I can't be the one to love you baby no not me
She said I'm runnin' through her head like a fuckin' flea
Lately I'm finna dip out and turn to memories
But 9 times outta 10 she don't want me to leave
(x2)


I just need you for a little baby not for keeps. (yeah!)
Keep the conversation moderate, not so deep. (yeah!)
Lately I been feeling you, baby feeling you. (you)
Maybe I can feel on you, baby feel on you. (baby you)
I just wanna dip and go and turn to memories
Every time you get fucked how you wanna you remember me
Every time you hearing 'bout relationship I'm stuck on your B
Like a melody, tryna stick around like full custody
Yeah I know I seem pushy but I gotta be
If I'm smokin' on that kushy then it's gotta stink
I been drinking way too much bitch I gotta pee
Told that to her and she never again got a glimpse from me
Roll it up, roll it up, I ain't talkin' sushi
I like that she bad, and that she boujee
Hate how she roll her eyes like she Lil Uzi
I ain't worried if that bitch 'bout to loose me

She been doing shit got me hot like jacuzzi. (bitch!)
She been on my dick, day and night like a groupie. (oou)
She told my main bitch facts 'bout me like she knew me. (what!?)
Really they ain't facts, random shit that she make up. (ay!)
Told her "hurry up" she take long with her make up. (hurry up)
I wanna fuck her but don't want her when I wake up. (when I wake)
She a 9 to 5 I showed her how to get her cake up. (get that cake)
Divin' board I'm on my shit, 'bout to dive in it
I don't listen to her what she speak ain't my business
But her body lookin' ripe, that's that Bally fitness. (ay!)
I ain't got too much time (no), she require a lot of maintenance
She workin' at the airport now, hmm, baggage claim
Ever since I fucked her once, hmm, ain't been the same
She just put an end to that, she don't fuck with lames
My lil' pendent just broke, bitch I'm off the chain
