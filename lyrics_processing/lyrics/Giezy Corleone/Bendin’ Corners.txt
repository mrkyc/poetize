Yeah I'm in this new car I might do the dash
Yeah, Ah Ah uh

I'm bending corners
I'm bending corners
In my new car, smoked a quarter
I'm bending corners
Whipping this foreigner
I'm moving forward
Major Move, I'm gettin warmer
Yo stacks is shorter
Stackin up like a hoarders
Fit out a horror
(X2)

I smashed ya girl only because she let me
Now she can't forget me
We sipped on Henny
Smoked the best weed
I need my stick
Like I can't see
I'm a walkin lick
I just spent a nick
I'm building a brand
Brick by brick
My hoe thick
Can't fit her whole ass in one pic
Got options for the fit, I make a pick
Fly as shit, I'm making plays
Type you'd feel like you're in a maze
Marathon runner, I don't do relays
I'm here to stay like I bought the place
No sunflowers but I spit my seeds at her face
Left her, said that I need my space
Use to wash cash out of Chase
I turn her on, like if I'm her key
I ate the beef teriyaki
All in a days
I'm Workin on holidays


I'm bending corners
I'm bending corners
In my new car, smoked a quarter
I'm bending corners
Whipping this foreigner
I'm moving forward
Major Move, I'm gettin warmer
Yo stacks is shorter
Stackin up like a hoarders
Fit out a horror

I bending corners in this new whip
I don't know how to act
Circle so small, My phone ain't
Got a contact
In a real-life situation you don't
Know how to react
Now days if you want a feature
I'm a need me a contract
Fall down, I'm a bounce back
No cap in none of my tracks
Thats no cap in my raps
Run laps round you, like track
My jeans rang up a rack
I'm flying for that pack
I'm tryna stuff my safe
In my hand that bag safe
I'm going going going going going for the win. win!
I just put some turtle waxed all four of my rims
If you on some lame shit Ima hit you in ya chin
She said that she only sip Hen not no Gin

I'm bending corners
I'm bending corners
In my new car, smoked a quarter
I'm bending corners
Whipping this foreigner
I'm moving forward
Major Move, I'm gettin warmer
Yo stacks is shorter
Stackin up like a hoarders
Fit out a horror
