Baby
I used to watch your flowers grow
Now it's raining
And all your petals turns to stone
I've been praying
I turn around and see my rose
But you've faded
You let me down, now it's time to go

You're like diamond and I'm like glass
Like oil and water we always clash
Sometimes my confessions are hard for me
I'll tell you now I'm setting you free

That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
It may be too late, our time is done

Baby
I think you've got your timing wrong
Hating
Is blowing this high we're riding on
And it's crazy
To think that I could be reborn
If you saved me
But now it's too late, and you'll never know

You're like diamond and I'm like glass
Like oil and water we always clash
Sometimes my confessions are hard for me
I'll tell you now I'm setting you free

That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
It may be too late, our time is done
With broken wings, I can't fly
(With broken wings, I can't fly)
Girl, I'm gonna need you to save me
Angel of mine
With broken wings, I can't fly
(With broken wings, I can't fly)
Girl, I'm gonna need you to save me
Angel of mine

That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
It may be too late, our time is done

You're like diamond and I'm like glass
Like oil and water we always clash
Sometimes my confessions are hard for me
