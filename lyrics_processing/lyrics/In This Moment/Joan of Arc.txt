Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?

You keep pushing me right to the edge
You are sanctified and I'm just a mess
And you blame me for, blame me for everything you hate
And you wage your wars
No matter what I give, you always take

You can crucify
You can nail me to your cross (light me up, light me up)
You can find me guilty for everything you've lost (light me up, light me up)
Go ahead, blame me for your sins
Go ahead and sacrifice me
Make me your martyr
I'll be your Joan of
I'll be your Joan of Arc
(Burn!)

You want to satisfy your high command
And you want to touch my face
With your dirty hands
So you blame me for
You blame me for the madness you create
And I wage my wars
Cause either way you'll burn me at the stake
