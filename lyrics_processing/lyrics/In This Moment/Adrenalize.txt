Adrenalize me

Come a little bit closer
Before we begin
Let me tell you how I want it
And exactly what I need
I'm here for one drug
I'm only here for one thing
So come on and tell me
Can you fly like you're free?

'Cause I need to feel
Yeah, I need to say

I must confess I'm addicted to this
Shove your kiss straight through my chest
I can't deny, I'd die without this
Make me feel like a God
Music, love, and sex
(Adrenalize me)
I crave excess, turning wine into sweat
Dripping down my neck
I can't deny, I'd die without this
Make me feel like a God
Adrenaline and sex

Get a little bit higher
So we can fall 'til we bleed
Push a little bit harder
Pull me into the speed
So tell me, can you feel this?
Come into my dream
Are you ready to awaken?
Are you ready to feed?

'Cause I need to feel
Yeah, I need to say

I must confess I'm addicted to this
Shove your kiss straight through my chest
I can't deny, I'd die without this
Make me feel like a God
Music, love, and sex
(Adrenalize me)
I crave excess, turning wine into sweat
Dripping down my neck
I can't deny, I'd die without this
Make me feel like a God
Adrenaline and sex
We have to live before we die
We were born to live before we die
Don't you wanna live before you die?
Let me see you live before you die
