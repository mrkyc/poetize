It's haunting
This hold that you have over me
I grow so weak

I see you
And everything around you fades
And I can't speak
But you can never know what it is you do to me

I can't take what you're doin' to me!
I can't take it! (What it is you do to me)
I can't take what you're doin' to me!
I can't take it!

No matter what I say or what I do
I know how this will end
So I'm turning away now before we begin
And no matter what you say or what you do
I know how this will end
So I'm turning away now
I'm dangerous for you
I'm dangerous for you

You touch me
And I can barely make a move
And I can't breathe
(I can't breathe)

You can never know what it is you do to me

I can't take what you're doin' to me!
I can't take it! (What it is you do to me)
I can't take what you're doin' to me!
I can't take it!

No matter what I say or what I do
I know how this will end
So I'm turning away now before we begin
And no matter what you say or what you do
I know how this will end
So I'm turning away now
I'm dangerous
