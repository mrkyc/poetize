Once upon a time
There was a nasty little piggy filled with pride and greed
Once upon a time
There was an eager little pig, your typical disease
You see, this little pig is slowly becoming my own worst enemy
You see, this eager pig
She's a blood, blood, blood-sucking part of me

Everywhere I go, you go along with me (She said)
Anything you get is all because of me (I said)
Everything I do, you do along with me (She said)
No matter where you run, you cannot hide from me

She's gotta hold on me
Maybe she is just what they want me to be

Even in these chains, you can't stop me
Even in these chains, you can't stop me

Pig, pig, won't you let me in?

You see, I am the wolf
And this dirty, little piggy lives inside of me
You see every now and then
I forget which one I want and which one that I need
I have come to realize
That both of them have become a necessity
And I have come to realize
That I become which animal I choose to feed
Anything I say you lie along with me (She said)
Every song you sing is all because of me (I said)
Anytime I cry you always laugh at me (She said)
No matter what you do you will belong to me

She's gotta hold on me
Maybe she is just what they want me to be
