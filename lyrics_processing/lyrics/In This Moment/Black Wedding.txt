Priest, are you there?
Can you hear my voice?
Will you hear my prayers?
Are you out there?
Forgive me, priest
For I have sinned (I know not what I do)
Mother I am here, I can hear your song
I can feel your fear, he's done you wrong
Temptation fed, his own desires
In the ring of fire (In the ring of fire)
Tonight!

I would've loved you for a thousand years
I would've died for you
I would've sacrificed it all my dear
I would've bled for you
'Til death do us part
You were unholy right from the start
It's a nice night for a black wedding
Yeah, it's a nice night for a black wedding

I heard your cry and I just knew
I never meant to forsake you
Mother, there's no reason to repent
(You know not what you do)
I heard the bells and I just knew
An angel once, now a ghost of you
Deliver me from my own desires
From my ring of fire (From my ring of fire)
Tonight!

I would've loved you for a thousand years
I would've died for you
I would've sacrificed it all my dear
I would've bled for you
'Til death do us part
You were unholy right from the start
It's a nice night for a black wedding
Yeah, it's a nice night for a black wedding
Nice night for a black wedding
Nice night for a black wedding
Nice night for a black wedding
Nice night for a black wedding
Nice night for a black wedding
Come on!

I would've loved you for a thousand years
I would've died for you
I would've sacrificed it all my dear
I would've bled for you
'Til death do us part
You were unholy right from the start
It's a nice night for a black wedding
Yeah, it's a nice night for a black wedding
Nice night for a black wedding
Nice night for a black wedding
Nice night for a black wedding
Nice night for a black wedding
(Spoken: Maria Brink)
In my name shall they cast out demons
They shall speak in new tongues
They shall take up serpents
And if they drink any deadly poison
It shall in no wise hurt them
They shall lay hands on the sick
And they shall recover
The serpent is only brought into the Holy Sanctum
And only handled
If the Holy Ghost
Of the Holy Spirit
