I hate you for the sacrifices you made for me
I hate you for every time you ever bled for me
I hate you for the way you smile when you look at me
I hate you for never taking control of me
I hate you for always saving me from myself
I hate you for always choosing me and not someone else
I hate you for always pulling me back from the edge
I hate you for every kind word you ever said

I'll bleed you dry now

Blood, blood, blood
Pump mud through my veins
Shut your dirty, dirty mouth
I'm not that easy
Blood, blood, blood
Pump mud through my veins
I'm a dirty, dirty girl
I want it filthy
Blood, blood, blood
Pump mud through my veins
Shut your dirty, dirty mouth
I'm not that easy
Blood, blood, blood
Pump mud through my veins
I'm a dirty, dirty girl
I want it filthy
