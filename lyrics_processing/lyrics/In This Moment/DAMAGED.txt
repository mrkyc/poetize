I wish there was a way
For me to put this into words
All these feelings that I have
As I start to lose control
I feel panic rushing over me
And gripping at my chest
And no matter what I say or do
I know that that it won't rest
I feel my vision fade
Sweat dripping down my back
I can hear my heart pound
I can feel my mind crack
And I know that you love me
And you want to save me now
In the end of it all
You can't save me from myself

Am I too damaged for you
After everything we've been through
And if you go, I won't stop you
You're not damaged like me
Am I too damaged for you?
After everything we went through
If you stay, I won't stop you
You'll end up damaged like me

I know you think I'm damaged
And I question everything
I'm obsessive and compulsive
A disorder I can't flee
I'll race you to the end
You see I got a manic side
And the more I try to fight it
He grows stronger every time
Post-traumatic stress
Yeah that's what my doctor said
So when I think I'm dying
I just got to take a breath
I know that you love me
And you want to save me now
In the end of it all
You can't save me from myself

Am I too damaged for you
After everything we've been through
And if you go, I won't stop you
You're not damaged like me
Am I too damaged for you?
After everything we went through
If you stay, I won't stop you
You'll end up damaged like me
You know I never wanted you to leave
I didn't mean for you to hurt along the way
'Cause I would tear myself apart without you here
And you would sabotage it all for me to stay
I'm code red, it's alright
I'm code red, it's alright

Am I too damaged for you
After everything we've been through
And if you go, I won't stop you
You're not damaged like me
Am I too damaged for you?
After everything we went through
If you stay, I won't stop you
You'll end up damaged like me
Damaged like me
