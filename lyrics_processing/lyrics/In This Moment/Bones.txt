I've been waiting on my grave
Waiting for you to rescue me, my love
Come back from the dead
You have a better heart
And a perfect skull (perfect skull)
I said, love
You're all the hurt I need

There's just something about you
It feeds the addict in me
I promised you that I'd hurt you...
(hurt you, you you you you)

You are my god
You are my soul
You're my savior
In a devil's world
And I can't exist without you
I can't exist without you
You are my drug
My miracle
You are my cure
In this infected world
And I can't do this without you
I'm dying here without you
I wanna lie with your bones forever...

Smear my lipstick across my face
Wipe off all these lies for me, my love
Tell me what you see
Kiss my wrist
You're killing me (You're killing me, killing me)
You're my pill
You're everything I need...

I'm running circles around you
Your skin is under my nails
I don't belong here without you...
(you you you you)

You are my god
You are my soul
You're my savior
In a devil's world
And I can't exist without you
I can't exist without you
You are my drug
My miracle
You are my cure
In this infected world
And I can't do this without you
I'm dying here without you
I wanna lie with your bones forever...
You are my star
I'm in your veins
You are my heart
I serenade your pain
Now you can't exist without me
You are my god...
(god god god god god)

You are my god
You are my soul
You're my savior
In a devil's world
And I can't exist without you
