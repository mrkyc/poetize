Pushing like pudding, like butter, like gold
You wanna get the cash, you wanna get the fool
You wanna find a fake, you wanna be seen
You wanna blame an addict, but you're already a fiend

Fuck it, the whole world is gonna see
High off fumes, addicted to the feed
What's it all for? Like you don't really know
Another on the hook and another Jane Doe
You're pushing back and forth and forth and back again
And you said that you were free, now you're locked in a cage
You're pushing lies like your life is on the line
You want a reason why, now you're begging for a sign

Maybe
Maybe we're all fucked
Maybe we'll all burn
Maybe we'll all just purge and yeah
Maybe we'll all die
Maybe you were right
Maybe we're all just parasites
(The purge)

You cutting like glass, like needles, like knives
You wanna get the girl, you wanna win the fight
You wanna be a god, you wanna be a star
You wanna blame another and this time you went too far

Fuck it, the whole world's gone mad
High off smoke, addicted to the fad
Why am I here? Like I don't really know
Another in the bag and another Jane Doe
You're pushing back and forth and forth and back again
And you said that you were free now you're locked in a cage
You're pushing lies like your life is on the line
You want a reason why, now you're begging for a sign

Maybe
Maybe we're all fucked
Maybe we'll all burn
Maybe we'll all just purge and yeah
Maybe we'll all die
Maybe you were right
Maybe we're all just parasites

I can feel the purge
I can feel the purge coming on
Maybe
Maybe we're all fucked
Maybe we'll all burn
Maybe we'll all just purge and yeah
Maybe we'll all die
Maybe you were right
Maybe we're all just parasites
