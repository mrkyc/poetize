"So when they continued asking him
He lifted up himself and said onto them
'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.'"

Listen closely, to what I'm about to say
I think I've heard just about enough of your hypocritic ways
Don't try and stop me now
Don't you make a sound
You've built yourself up oh so high just to tear me down
I'm so tired of you telling me
How to live and what I should not be
And I'm so tired of you telling me
What to do and what I don't believe
And after all that you're telling me
Why is there hate and only you can see
And I'm so sick of you telling me
That I will burn, I will not be free

This is my song
My red crusade
What will I say?
What will I do?
Maybe it's fear that leads your rage
Maybe you're me and I am you

So go ahead and point your finger
Tell me who to love is it him or her?
When will you see this is who I am?

I'm not gonna change
So, stay out of my way
I don't need you to understand
That I'm already saved
Maybe you should stop, question all your pain
Can you look me in my eyes and say we're not the same?
Did you really think by pushing me
I would become what you want me to be?
And did you really think by hating me
I'd open up, I'd just hand you the key?
I know you're scared and don't understand
This is my life, this is who I am
What I do know is come Judgement Day
I followed love, can you say the same?

This is my song
My red crusade
What will I say?

Maybe it's fear that leads your rage
