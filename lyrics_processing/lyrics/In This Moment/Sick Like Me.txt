Sick, sick, sick
Sick, sick, sick

Is it sick of me, to need control of you?
Is it sick to make you beg the way I do?
Is it sick of me to want you crawling on your knees?
Is it sick to say I want you biting down on me?

Are you sick like me?

Am I beautiful (am I beautiful)
As I tear you to pieces? (as I tear you to pieces)
Am I beautiful? (am I beautiful)
Even at my ugliest, you always say
I'm beautiful  (I am I beautiful)
As you tear me to pieces (as you tear me to pieces)
You are beautiful (you are beautiful)
Even at your ugliest, I always say
You're beautiful and sick like me

Is it sick of me to feed the animal in you?
Is it sick to say 'I tease the hunter' like I do?
Is it sick of me to watch the wicked way you thrill?
Is it sick to say that I live to break your will?
