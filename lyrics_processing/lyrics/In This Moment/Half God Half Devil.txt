You look at me like I'm a revelation
You wanna know if I can bring salvation
You saw a sinner, saw a saint inside of me
You wanna know if I'm a friend or an enemy

I waged war in a fiery blaze
I found peace in a purple haze
My angels and my demons
They don't know their place
Ready or not, they're gonna come out and play

I can be your heavenly or I can be your hell
I can say a prayer for you or I can cast a spell
I'll push you to the darkness just to pull you to the light
'Cause I can take away your breath or I can bring you back to life

Half God, Half Devil
Half God, Half Devil
Half God, Half Devil
Half God, Half Devil

I won't pretend that I resist temptation
I think it's funny when you preach damnation
I've been to hell and back and now it's just a part of me
Without the darkness there'd be no light in me
