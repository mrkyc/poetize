Uhm, hey, Deb
Mhm
Thank you for being woman enough to come
Whitney, what's this about?

I know he's leaving me for you
Who said that? Who told you that is true?
What is he telling you?
Could it be the same things that he told me?
He told me that he loved me
I heard that
He told me I was beautiful
How did you know? How did you know?
'Cause I've played that scene before

This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember, you've been warned
Enjoy it now, 'cause it won't last
Same script, different cast
You might also like
What you're saying could be true
But how can I take advice from you?
I'm not hating, but I wish the one before me
Would have warned me too, babe
Don't say no more (La la la la la la la la la)
Uncover your ears, girl
I'm not listening (La la la la la la la la la)
But I know you hear me
Maybe my reasons are wrong, but I know that you believe me

This is a retake of my life (A retake of my life)
I was his star for many nights (Star for many, many, many nights)
Now the roles have changed
(And you're the leading lady in his life)
Lights (Lights), camera, now you're on (Camera, now you're on)
Just remember, you've been warned (Remember you've been warned)
(Enjoy it now, 'cause it won't last
Same script, different cast)

It's your fault, you didn't love him enough
That's the problem, I loved him too much
And when you love him, he becomes unattracted to you
Oh no, he's changed and I'll prove you wrong
No, you won't
So go away, leave us the hell alone, 'cause he loves me
He'll hurt you
He'll stay with me
He'll leave you for sure
For sure?
This is a retake of my life (A retake of my life; Yes, it is)
I was his star for many, many nights (Star for many, many, many, many nights)
Now the roles have changed (Now, na-na-na-na-na-na-now the roles have changed)
(And I'm the leading lady in his life)
Lights (Lights), camera, now you're on (Camera, now you're on)
Just remember, you've been warned (You've been warned)
(Enjoy it now, because it won't last, no
Same script, different cast)

This is a retake of your life
You were his star for many, many nights
But now the roles have changed
I'm the leading lady in his life
Lights (Lights), camera, now you're on
Just remember, you've been warned
Enjoy it now, 'cause this will last
I'm the future, you're his past

This is a retake of my life (The past, oh)
I was his star for many nights (Oh, oh)
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember, you've been warned (Remember you've been warned)
Enjoy it now (Just you watch us now)
It won't last (I know it will last)
