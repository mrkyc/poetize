Now tell me how you'd feel if I told you that I
Have feelings for you, baby
And would it be so wrong to say what's on my mind?
I'm sorry I have to, baby, baby

We were friends, but with time
What I feel, deep inside
For you (For you) has changed (Has changed)
But I'd give up on love (Uh-uh)

Untrue (Untrue)

I know that we're just friends
But what if I decide
To bring something in? Ooh, yeah, uh
I hope it won't offend
The trust we have, 'cause I
Don't want this to end
No no no, baby

If you think we will lose
What we have
Then I'd just tather stay (Rather stay)
The same (The same, baby)
'Cause I don't want to choose (Ah, huh, ooh, yeah, yeah)
Between two of the most precious things (Precious things)
To me (To me, oh yeah)

If I told you that (And if I told you)
I'll always keep you (I'll always keep you)
What would you say (What would you say?)
If I told you that?

If we take this chance
And extend to each other romance
And I hope it would be
The right thing for you and me, oh yeah

If I told you that (Baby, baby, baby baby)
I wanted to see you (I wanted to see, ha)
And if I told you that (And if I told you)
I beg to please you (I beg to please you, oh)
