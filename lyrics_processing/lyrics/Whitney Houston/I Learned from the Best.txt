Ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh

Did you really think that
I would really take you back
Let you back in my heart one more time? Oh, no, no
Did you think that I'd still care
That there'd be more feeling there?
Did you think you could walk back in my life? Oh
So you found you miss the love you threw away, uh
Baby, but you found it out too late, too late

And so you know the way it feels to cry (To cry)
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
Baby, I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best
I learned from you (Oh, baby, now)
I learned from you

I remember cold nights
And tears I thought would never dry
How you shattered my world
With your goodbye, your goodbye, baby
Would've sold my soul then
Just to have you back again
Now you are the last thing on my mind, mm
Now you say you're sorry and you've changed your ways
Sorry, but you changed your ways too late
You might also like
And so you know the way it feels to cry (To cry)
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two (The way that I cried)
Baby, I learned the way to break a heart (I know, I know the way to break a heart)
I learned from the best
I learned from you (Oh, baby, now, oh, baby, now)
I learned from you (Oh)

So when all you've got are sleepless nights
When those tears are clouding up your eyes
Just remember it was you who said goodbye
Who said goodbye


And so you know the way it feels to cry (You know the way it feels to cry)
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two (Broke my world in)
And baby, I learned the way to break a heart (I learned the way, I learned the way to break a heart)
I learned from the best
I learned from you
Learned the way to break a heart (To break a heart)
I learned from the best
I learned from you
I learned from the best
