One night not long ago
I fell for you
Too easy to let go
She was one from your past
One of the few
You said it didn't last

Now Romeo, you know I can't believe
Your tongue would slip so easily
I know you think I oughta let it be
But get it right, next time
That's the end of me

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Don't wanna hear about Susan
She's got nothing on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan
(No, no, no, no, no, get it right)
You might also like
Last night you were asleep
Deep in a dream
I heard you call her name
Then you turned to embrace
I froze in place
Never to be the same

Now Romeo, you know I never knew
My heart would bust so easily
I know you think I oughta let it go
But get it right next time
Say good-bye to me, boy

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say (You better watch what you say, boy)
If you still need her
Then be on your way (Be on your way, yeah)
Don't wanna hear about Susan (I don't wanna hear)
She's got nothing on me (Nothing on me)
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan (You better watch what you say)
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Don't wanna hear about Susan
She's got nothing on me (Got nothing on me)
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan, oh
I never wanna be the girly that you "call" one and only
You know the kind of girl
That you would call when you get lonely
I never should have let you in
A damn shame
Forgot my name!
Well, anyway

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her (Need her)
Then be on your way (Boy, don't you be on your way)
Don't want to hear about Susan
She's got nothing on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan

Don't wanna hear about Susan
Oh no, oh no, no, no, no
My name ain't Susan
