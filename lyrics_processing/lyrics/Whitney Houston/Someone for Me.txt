Ooh
Someone for me
Someone for me

I'm here alone on a Friday night
Waiting here beside the phone
The TV, radio and me
Really ain't been getting along
Mm, I wish that I could fly away
Party 'til the break of day
And there I'd be sure to meet
The guy that would be special to me
Then momma comes and asks me
Why I am dreaming, sitting alone?
Why not go out and have some fun?
It's the only way I'll ever find someone for me
While I am young and seventeen

Someone for me (Someone for me)
I've got to find someone
Someone (Someone for me)
I've got to find someone, yeah (Ooh)

Now there's a party down at Angie's house
With people packed against the walls (Mm)
I'm sitting in a corner here (Mm)
Trying to make sense of it all
And when I least expect it
Meeting the guy I see in my dreams (Ooh)
Here he is walking up to me
And asking if I'd like to come and dance with him
I think I found someone for me

Someone for me (Someone for me)
I've got to find someone
Someone (Someone for me)
I've got to find someone
I need somebody for me
I need somebody for me, someone
Oh

And so I'm finding out that
Dreams you believe in, can come to be (Ooh)
And now I'm looking up to find the joy
And happiness can come to you and me
At last, I found someone for me
Someone for me (Someone for me)
I need somebody for me, I need somebody for me, someone
(Someone for me)
Someone for me, someone for me
Someone (Someone for me)
Someone, someone, someone
Someone, someone, someone for me (Someone for me)
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, yeah, yeah, ooh (Someone for me)
Oh, I need somebody for me
I need somebody for me, someone (Someone for me)
Someone for me, someone for me
Someone (Someone for me)
Someone, somebody, someone, somebody
Someone, somebody for me (Someone for me)
Someone, somebody, someone, somebody for me
(Someone for me) Oh
