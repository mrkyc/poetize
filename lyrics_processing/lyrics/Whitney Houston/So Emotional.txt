I don't know why I like it, huh
I just do
Woo, ooh
Ooh

I've been hearin' your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photo right beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head, uh
I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good?
I got a love of my own, babe
I shouldn't get so hung up on you

I remember the way that we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much
Ah, uh

I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?

I gotta watch you walk in the room, baby
I gotta watch you walk out, yes, I do
I like the animal way you move
And when you talk, I just watch your mouth

Oh, I remember the way that we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much
Ooh

I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
