Ooh, ooh, baby
Alright, yeah

In a world where dreams are few
You've got me, baby, I've got you
You're the one that makes me feel brand new
Sometimes love can wear you out
Chill your soul, baby, make you doubt
That you'll never find the one that's true

All my life I've longed for this
Someone who makes me happy
Let's seal this moment with a kiss
I wanna know
And nothing's gonna stop me

'Cause I've been to the bottom
Now I'm back on top
And I'm feeling the rhythm as we start to rock
When you get down to it
I belong to you (Ooh, oh, oh, ooh, hey, baby)
You might also like
Though I'm not afraid to let it show
I'll tell the world I want everyone to know
There's nobody who does me like you do, boy (Like you do, like you do)

All of my love is yours tonight (Tonight)
I live to make you happy (Make you happy)
Nothing has ever felt so right (So right)
I want it all (Oh)
And nothing's gonna stop me

'Cause I've been to the bottom
Now I'm back on top
And I'm feeling the rhythm as we start to rock
When you get down to it, boy
You know, I belong to you (Ooh, oh)

When you touch me tender and you reach my soul
When I start to weaken and I lose control
When you get down to it (Get down to it)
I belong to you (Ooh, oh)
To you
Say that you love me, boy, and I'll make it right (Oh yeah)
I'll rock you heart and soul 'til the morning light (Boy, no)
I will, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, hee, ooh

You know I belong to you (I'll rock you, babe)
(I'll rock you, babe)
And you belong to me (I'll rock you, babe)
(I'll rock you now, ooh)

All of my love is yours tonight (Tonight)
I live to make you happy (Make you happy)
Nothing has ever felt so right (So right)
I want it all (Oh)
And nothing's gonna stop me

'Cause I've been to the bottom
Now I'm back on top
And I'm feeling the rhythm as we start to rock
When you get down to it (Get down to it)
I belong to you (I belong to you, ooh, oh, oh)

When you touch me tender (Touch me tender)
And you reach my soul (You reach my soul)
When I start to weaken (I start to weaken)
And I lose control (I lose control)
When you get down to it (Get down to it)
I belong to you (I belong to you, baby, ooh, and you belong to me)
(Oh) I belong to you (I belong to you)
I belong to you (And you belong to me)
I belong to you (I belong to you)
I belong to you (You belong to me)
When you get down to it
I belong to you, baby
And you beling to me
I belong to you (I belong to you)
I belong to you (You belong to me)
I belong to you (I belong to you)
I belong to you (You belong to me)
