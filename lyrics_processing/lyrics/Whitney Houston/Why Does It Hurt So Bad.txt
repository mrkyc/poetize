Why does it hurt so bad?
Why do I feel so sad?
Thought I was over you
But I keep crying
When I don't love you
So, why does it hurt so bad?
I thought I had let you go
So, why does it hurt me so?
Gotta get you outta my head
It hurts so bad
Oh, it hurts so bad, baby, oh

My life's been better since the day I left you, boy
I must admit life's been kind to me
I went and did the things I said I would do, boy
I found someone who loves me for me, yeah, yes
Haven't had much drama since the day that we split, boy
My heart's never been more at ease
And when I think of all the things you put me through
Leaving you has been the best thing for me
