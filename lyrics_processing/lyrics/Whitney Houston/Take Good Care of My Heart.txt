Time can pass so slowly when you feel so all alone
Love can strike like lightning
When you find your heart a home

I've seen it in the movies
Read about it in a book
I never thought I'd feel it
But your touch was all it took

Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby, you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart

Come and make your magic (Mm)
'Til you have me hypnotized (Ooh)
If we get any closer
I'll be drowning in your eyes (Ooh)
You might also like
You're the one I needed most
When my love was on the line
I'm so glad you gave me yours
When I gave you mine

So take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby, you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart


I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feeling so good (Oh it keeps me feeling so)
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
(Take good care of me)
Take good care of my heart
Baby, you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should (Yes, I do)
But it keeps me feeling so good (Oh, it keeps me feeling so)
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart
(Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart)
Won't you please?
Baby, you're the first to take it
And you're the only one who can break it
