I don't wanna buy what they're sellin' these days
Sayin' feelin' and fallin' is all a mistake
No, no
And why does everybody look at young hearts feeling love
Like it's just a matter of time before they break?
No, no

They started sayin', "When you can't hide, run"
"When you can't run, hide"
Started thinkin' love's a loaded gun
Nobody wants to fight
And when did we all start thinkin' that the world
Stop spinnin' in a kiss goodnight?
And when did our heartbeat beatin' too fast
Stop meanin' it was worth the while?

I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide

Traded out our eyes to light a screen
Traded out holdin' hands to holdin' back everything
No, no
No, no, oh
And words got shorter and quiet got longer
And all of a sudden, love started lookin' like a memory
No, no, no

Started thinkin' love's a loaded gun
Nobody wants to fight
And when did we all start thinkin' that the world

I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide, no

They started sayin', "When you can't hide, run"
"When you can't run, hide"
But love don't gotta be a loaded gun
Or a losin' fight
And when did we all start thinkin' that the world
Stop spinnin' in a kiss goodnight?
And when did our heartbeat beatin' too fast
Stop meanin' it was worth the while?
But I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide

And I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide
