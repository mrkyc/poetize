Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh-oh, la-la)
Da-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah

Think I only want one number in my phone
I might change your contact to "Don't Leave Me Alone"
You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh

But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-blee"
I don't want no one else (No, no), baby, I'm in too deep
Here's a lil' song I wrote (A song I wrote), it's about you and me (Me)

I'll be honest
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
And when you got your arms around me
Oh, it feels so good
I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
See Sabrina Carpenter LiveGet tickets as low as $126You might also like
I'm talkin' all around the clock
I'm talkin' hope nobody knocks
I'm talkin' opposite of soft
I'm talkin' wild, wild thoughts
You gotta keep up with me
I got some young energy
I caught the L-O-V-E
How do you do this to me?

But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-bleh-blee"
And I don't want no one else (No, no), baby, I'm in too deep (Too deep)
Here's a lil' song I wrote (A song I wrote), it's about you and me

I'll be honest (Honest)
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense (Nonsense)
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in (When you walk in)
When you got your arms around me
Oh, it feels so good
I had to hit the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense (Oh-oh)
I'm talkin', I'm talkin', I'm talkin'
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Na-na-na), I'm talkin'
(Blah-blah, blah-blah)
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah (Ah-ah)
I don't even know anymore
(Oh)

This song catchier than chickenpox is
I bet your house is where my other sock is
Woke up this morning, thought I'd write a pop hit, ha-ha
How quickly can you take your clothes off? Pop quiz
That one's not gonna make it
