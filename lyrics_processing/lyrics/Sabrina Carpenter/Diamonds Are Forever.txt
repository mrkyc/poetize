No

Think you got your break?
I'm no sugar mama, I'm no piggy bank
Tell me what you think, nah, nah, nah
Stackin' bills and counting change
I'm no Rockefeller, I'm not what you think
No way, nah, nah, nah

I'm your new money
Drop it all on your crew, spent too soon money
One percent, I'm at the top of this earth money
That's what I'm worth, honey
That's what I'm worth, worth, worth

I am a diamond
And diamonds are forever
My love is timeless
'Cause diamonds are forever (Oh no, no)
Money don't buy class
And I can't be bought like that, like that
I am a diamond
And diamonds are forever
