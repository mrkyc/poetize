Oh, so you do have a type and it's not me
Oh, so you can reply, just to not me
If you wanted brown eyes
I coulda got contacts
So y'all are in Paris now, guess it's public
Face like that other girl you're in love with
You knew I would see that
You knew I would notice

She looks nothing like me
Can't really tell, should I be
Tryna take it as a compliment?
It's kinda feelin' like the opposite
She looks nothing like me
So why do you look so happy?
Now I think I get the cause of it
You were holdin' out to find the opposite

And I know now
Even if I tried to change
That somehow
You'd end up with her anyway
Oh, I know now
Even if I tried to change
That somehow
You'd end up with her anyway

Does she step out the spotlight so you bathe in it?
Does she get up on top of you more than I would?

Just wonderin', when you (When you)
Said I'm beautiful
Was I bein' lied to?
