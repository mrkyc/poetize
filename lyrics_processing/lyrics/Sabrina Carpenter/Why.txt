You like New York City in the daytime
I like New York City in the nighttime
You say you like sleeping with the air off
I don't, I need it on
You like the light coming through the windows
I sleep late, so I just keep 'em all closed
You ignore the music on the radio
I don't, I sing along

I don't ask for you to change, baby, no, no, no
And you don't ask for me to change

Tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well and we don't even know why
Funny how the stars crossed right
'Cause we work so well and we don't even know why
You can call it fire and ice
But we work so well and we don't even know why
We don't even know why, no, no
We don't even know why, no, no, no

No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime
We like it in the end of time
No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime
We like it in the end of time

Cold outside and you're just in a T-shirt
I have cold blood even in a sweater
You start your night sippin' by the Kilo
I don't, I know you know

I don't ask for you to change, baby, no, no, no
And you don't ask for me to change

Tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well and we don't even know why
Funny how the stars crossed right
'Cause we work so well and we don't even know why
You can call it fire and ice
But we work so well and we don't even know why
We don't even know why, no, no (No, no, no)
We don't even know why, no, no, no

No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime (We don't even know)
We like it in the end of time (We don't even know)
No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime
(We don't even know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know)
We like it in the end of time
Somehow, we end up on the same side
And you wouldn't think that we'd be alright
Even our eyes are different colors, but we see fine
Somehow, we end up on the same side (Up on the same side)
And you wouldn't think that we'd be alright
(Think that we'd be alright)
Even our eyes are different colors, but we see fine

(Oh) Tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well and we don't even know why
('Cause we work so well and we don't even know why, why)
Funny how the stars crossed right
'Cause we work so well and we don't even know why
(But we don't even know why)
You can call it fire and ice
But we work so well and we don't even know why
('Cause we work so well and we don't even know why, why)
We don't even know why, no, no
We don't even know why, no, no, no

No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime (Oh)
We like it in the end of time (We don't even know why)
No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime
