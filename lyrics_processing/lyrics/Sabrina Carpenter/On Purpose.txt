Your eyes crashin' into my eyes
Was I accidentally falling in love?
Your words didn't mean to heal the hurt
We're coincidentally more than enough

All these days, I never thought
That I would need someone so much
Who knew?
But I don't think I ever planned
For this helpless circumstance with you

You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose

(Go) Hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose
(Go) Hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose

My dreams running into your dreams
It's as if we wished on the same star
And my time changing all of your time
It's a butterfly effect on my heart

All these days, I never thought
That I would need someone so much
Who knew? Who knew?
But I don't think I ever planned
For this helpless circumstance with you
Oh, whoa

You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose

(Go) Hey, huh (On purpose)
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose
(Go) Hey, huh
Hey, huh, hey, huh, hey
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
Oh, you're scared

You're scared, I'm nervous
But I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose
Baby, I know it's weird, but it's worth it
'Cause I guess that we did it on purpose
On purpose, on purpose

Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
But I guess that we did it on purpose
Lost in darkness
You're my focus
Love me hopeless
