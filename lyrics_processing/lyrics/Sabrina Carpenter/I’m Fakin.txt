We're picking fights, we're fully grown
How come we get so immature when we're alone?
I roll my eyes, you check your phone
You say I'm overly dramatic and I know

'Cause I wanna bring you to your knees
Begging for me now, begging for me
Push you to the edge to see
How far you're willing to reach

I'm slamming the door, but I'm staying
I make up my mind and I change it
It's you that I want when we're breaking
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
I'm losing the game that I'm playing
Keep pulling me close 'cause I'm fading
Don't forget the words that I'm saying
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking

(La, ra-ra-ra-ra) I'm faking
(La, ra-ra-ra-ra) I'm faking, oh
(La, ra-ra-ra-ra) I'm faking
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking

We go ego to ego, starting fires
Saying shit we don't mean, I mean we're liars
But the truth is we're messed up and we like it
Shut up, shut up, shut up

'Cause I wanna bring you to your knees
Begging for me now, begging for me
Push you to the edge to see
How far you're willing to reach, yeah

I'm slamming the door, but I'm staying
I make up my mind and I change it
It's you that I want when we're breaking
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
I'm losing the game that I'm playing
Keep pulling me close 'cause I'm fading
Don't forget the words that I'm saying
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking

(La, ra-ra-ra-ra) I'm faking
(La, ra-ra-ra-ra) I'm faking, oh

Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
I wanna bring you to your knees
(I wanna bring you to your knees)
Begging for me now (Begging for me)
I wanna see how far you're willing to reach, yeah

I'm slamming the door, but I'm staying (I'm staying)
I make up my mind and I change it (Change it)
It's you that I want when we're breaking (It's you that I want)
Every time I tell you that we're done, I'm faking
