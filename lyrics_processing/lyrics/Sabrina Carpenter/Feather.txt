Oh, not another take

Oh, it's like that, I'm your dream come true
When it's on a platter for you
Then you pull back when I try to make plans
More than two hours in advance, mm

I slam the door, I hit ignore
I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more"
I got you blocked, after this, an afterthought
I finally cut you off

I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind (Ah)
Floatin' through the memories like whatever, you're a waste of time (Ah)
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch
You fit every stereotype, "Send a pic"
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you out my life
With you out my life

(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah
