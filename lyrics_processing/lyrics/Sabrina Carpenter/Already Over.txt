We been talkin' for hours
'Bout how we shouldn't talk for hours on end
Kissin' after a conversation
'Bout how we'd probably be better off as friends

Same time here next weekend
Say we won't do this again
Make me fall where I stand
Only like you can

Yeah, I say I'm done, but I'm still confused
How am I supposed to close the door when I still need the closure?
And I change my mind, but it's still on you
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?

Selfishly don't wanna give you
Time to be on someone else's lips (Ah)
But I'll take three short hours over
Three long weeks pretendin' like we don't exist, hmm (Ah)

Same time here next weekend
Say we won't do this again
Make me fall where I stand
Only like you can

And I change my mind, but it's still on you
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?

After the aftermath, I know you'll be comin' back
To the back bedroom and it won't be the last
Of the aftermath, I know you'll be comin' back
To the back bedroom and it won't be the last time

I say I'm done, but I'm still confused
How am I supposed to close the door when I still need the closure? (Ooh)
And I change my mind, but it's still on you
How am I supposed to leave you now that you're already over?

Yeah, I like my bed, but it likes you too
