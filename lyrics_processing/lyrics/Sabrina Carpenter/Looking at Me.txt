Oh
Oh, yeah

Did I catch your attention?
You look like you lost your breath, huh
When I circle the room, you an owl, you gon' twist your head
Don't you come at me green with an attitude
When my lips and my soles are red
If I leave you behind, you can look for the broken necks
No, no

'Cause I've been here once or twice
Never worry 'bout the eyes (Come on)

Don't just stand there staring, honey
Try to move your feet
If you think they looking at you
They looking at me
I could make it nice and easy
I'ma take the lead
They ain't even looking at you, baby
They looking at me

Yes, I'm young for a teacher, I'll teach you what you don't know
(I can teach you the things that you wanna know)
But I can't give it up all at once, you would overdose

It's a whole new rodeo
It could be you and me, but you know that I'll steal the show
