Glitter on the wet streets
Silver over everything
The river's all wet
You're all chrome (Oh)

Dripping with alchemy
Shiver stop shivering
The glitter's all wet
You're all chrome

The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, oh no
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no

Off, off-off, off-off, off, off, off-off, off-off, off
Off with your head
Dance, dance 'til you're dead, dead
Heads will roll, heads will roll
Heads will roll
On the floor
Off, off with your head
Dance, dance 'til you're dead, dead
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
On the floor

Looking glass
Take the past (Oh)
Shut your eyes
Mirror lies (Oh-oh)
Looking glass
Take the past
Shut your eyes
Mirror lies

(Oh, oh-oh, oh)
On the floor, on the floor, on the floor, on the floor
On the floor, on the floor, on the floor, on the floor
On the floor, o-o-o-o-on the floor, on the floor, o-o-o-o-on the floor
On the floor, o-o-o-o-on the floor, on-on-on-on on-o-on-on-o-o, dance, dance, dance, dance

Off with your head
Dance, dance 'til you're dead, dead
Heads will roll, heads will roll
Heads will roll on the floor
Off, off with your head
Dance, dance 'til you're dead, dead
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
On the floor
Off, off, off with your head
Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead
Off, off, off with your head
Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead
Off, off, off with your head
Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead
Off, off, off with your head
