Don't despair
You're there
From beginning to middle, to end
Don't despair
You're there through my wasted days
You're there through my wasted nights
Oh despair
You've always been there
You've always been there
You've always been there
You were there through my wasted years
Through all my lonely fears

No tears
Run through my fingers, tears
They're stinging my eyes, no tears
If it's all in my head
There's nothing to fear, nothing to fear inside
Through the darkness and the light
Some sun has got to rise

My sun is your sun
My sun is your sun
My sun is your sun
My sun is your sun
Their sun is our sun
Their sun is our sun
Their sun is our sun
Their sun is our sun
My sun is your sun
My sun is your sun
My sun is your sun
My sun is your sun
Their sun is our sun
Their sun is our sun
Their sun is our sun
Their sun is our sun
You might also like
Oh despair
You're there through my wasted days
You're there through my wasted nights
You're there through my wasted years
You're there through my wasted life
You've always been there
You've always been there
You've always been there
You were there through my wasted years
Through all of my lonely fears

No tears
Run through my fingers, tears
They're stinging my eyes, no tears
We're all on the edge
There's nothing to fear, nothing to fear inside
Through the darkness and the light
Some sun has got to rise

My sun is your sun
My sun is your sun
My sun is your sun
My sun is your sun
Their sun is our sun
Their sun is our sun
Their sun is our sun
(Some sun has got to rise)
My sun is your sun
My sun is your sun
My sun is your sun
My sun is your sun
Their sun is our sun
Their sun is our sun
Their sun is our sun
