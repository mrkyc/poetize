Sparks turn to flames
When hearts start to chase
You'll fall if you run, right into the smoke
The lights start to dim when it's almost enough
But flames light this place

Fireflies tonight
Cause love, lights the sky (Hey, yeah!)
So, put it up in, put it up in the air
Put it up in, put love in the air
So, put it up in, put it up in the air
Put it up in, put love in the air

Baby, it's only right that you share
Pass the love, and put it in the atmosphere
If you want keep it warm, living in the air
Just keep your rotation so the clouds go nowhere
Just please light this place, light this place
Woah-woah-woah-woah

Fireflies tonight
Cause love, lights the sky (Fireflies) (Hey, yeah!)
So, put it up in, put it up in the air (I want you to put it)
Put it up in, put love in the air (I want you to put it)
So, put it up in, put it up in the air (I want you to put it)
Put it up in, put love in the air (I want you to put it)
So, put it up in, put it up in the air
Put it up in, put love in the air (Put love in the air)
So, put it up in, put it up in the air (I want you to put it)
Put it up in, put love in the air (I want you to put it)
