I could have two girls in the bed
It wouldn't even get your attention
I could have powder as my best friend
Wouldn't even get your attention
I could be naked at dinner
And touchin' the waiter
The baddest behaviour, oh-oh, uh
Two girls in the bed
And it wouldn't even get your attention

And you got me thinking
Why
Do I even try?
Oh, why, babe?
Why?
Baby, I don't understand
Who are you with? Is it me or the light in your hands?

I'm right here
Why can't you look at me?
You keep your eyes on the screen like you don't care
That I'm right here
I'm wearing that perfume
That you got me in June
Do you not smell it in the air?
I'm right here
I'm right here
I'm right here
