She doesn't love you like I do
She doesn't have my name
However she tries to act like it
She'll never be the same

But she's new, and she's beautiful
You've never been in a fight
Yeah, it's awfully perfect now
But you just know deep inside

She is not me
She is not me
She is not me, baby
She is not me

Does she make you feel wanted like I did?
Make you feel like you're the one thing that matters?
You let her head rest on your chest
But when you close your eyes...

You'll be seeing my face again
I'll be crossing your mind
You'll be dreaming of places we went
And then you'll wake up to find...

That she is not me
She is not me
She is not me
Remember that she is not me, aye

Yeah, she is not me
She is not me
Part 2:

Said, I wonder now
Yeah, I wonder how you've been
Are you happy?
Is she still the one?
Are you having fun?
Is it for real, baby?
'Cause I'll be waiting here
Another week, or month or year
If you're lonely
God, I wish I knew everything about the two of you
Won't you tell me?
Does she have any humor?
Does she laugh at your jokes?
Can she look past the rumors?
Does she know how it goes?
Aye, or is it none of my business?
Do you go to the movies?
Do you make out in the park?
Do you stay up for hours?
And just talking the talk?
Aye, or is it none of my business?
Does she know 'bout the bracelets that were two of a kind?
Did you save, did you save it like I did mine?
Aye, or is it none of my business?
Would it make any difference if I got you alone?
If I called, would you listen?
Would you hang up the phone?
Aye, or is it none of my business?

None of my business
Is it none of my business?
None of my business
Is it none of my business?

She's not me, and she'll never be, never be, never be
She's not me, and she'll never be, never be, never be
She's not me, and she'll never be, never be, never be
