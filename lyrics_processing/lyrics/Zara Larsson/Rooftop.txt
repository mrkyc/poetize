We could be soulmates
We could be so great
We could be happy
One day, some day, or in a whole 'nother lifetime

Said the first time that we locked eyes, the shit was crazy
And the second time just blew my mind, the shit was crazy
Lately I don't know what I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got someone, and baby, so do you

It was the 3rd of September, we were hanging up on the roof
Was the hot, hot night, we were having a barbecue
And I said "Hi", you said "Hi", baby, that's when I knew
I just, I just can't, can't take my mind off you
It was a night to remember, we were hanging up on the roof
Someone got knocked out and in came the boys in blue
And you said "Bye", I said "Bye", some of that made the news
I just, I just can't, can't take my mind off you

One night on the rooftop
One night on the rooftop, rooftop
One sight at the rooftop
At the rooftop, rooftop

Then the rain came, something caught flame, and it was crazy
Yeah, there were sirens and firemen, the shit was crazy
Baby rushing down the stairs, I see you go
It was the saddest thing that I will ever know

It was the 3rd of September, we were hanging up on the roof
Was the hot, hot night, we were having that barbecue
And I said "Hi", you said "Hi", baby, that's when I knew
I just, I just can't, can't take my mind off you
It was a night to remember, we were hanging up on the roof
Someone got knocked out and in came the boys in blue
And you said "Bye", I said "Bye", some of that made the news
I just, I just can't, can't take my mind off you

One night on the rooftop
One night on the rooftop, rooftop
One sight at the rooftop
At the rooftop, rooftop
Sparks fly on the rooftop
Friends fight on the rooftop, rooftop
Bright lights at the rooftop
At the rooftop, rooftop
We could be soulmates
We could be so great
We could be happy
One day, some day

It was the 3rd of September, we were hanging up on the roof
Was the hot, hot night, we were having a barbecue
And I said "Hi", you said "Hi", baby, that's when I knew
I just, I just can't, can't take my mind off you
It was a night to remember, we were hanging up on the roof
Someone got knocked out and in came the boys in blue
And you said "Bye", I said "Bye", some of that made the news
I just, I just can't, can't take my mind off you (Can't take my mind)

One night on the rooftop
One night on the rooftop, rooftop (One night)
One sight at the rooftop (One night at the rooftop)
At the rooftop, rooftop
Sparks fly on the rooftop
Friends fight on the rooftop, rooftop
Bright lights at the rooftop
