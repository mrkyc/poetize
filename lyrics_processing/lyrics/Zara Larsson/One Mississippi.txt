One Mississippi, you're here
Lovin' me with your whole heart
And two Mississippi, we scream
To watch each other fall apart
Three Mississippi, you're gone
Sayin' that you're done, you don't want it no more
And four Mississippi, you're home
Like nothin' ever happened at all

Why do I stay? I know I should leave
Mascara fallin' down my cheek
But you pull me in and make me forget
About the broken glass on our skin

We don't get scared when the sirens come
A little fucked up 'cause we think it's fun
We kiss just to make up, we love just to break up
We head for disaster, but live for the danger
We count

One Mississippi, you're here
Lovin' me with your whole heart
And two Mississippi, we scream
To watch each other fall apart
Three Mississippi, you're gone
Sayin' that you're done, you don't want it no more
And four Mississippi, you're home
Like nothin' ever happened at all

I like the way, that you set the scene
The way you breathe in your nicotine
I like the way it burns when you say goodbye
I like the way it hurts when you screw with my mind

Or am I fucked up that I think it's fun
That we don't get scared when the sirens come?
We kiss just to make up, we love just to break up
We head for disaster, but live for the danger
We count

One Mississippi, you're here (Here)
Lovin' me with your whole heart
And two Mississippi, we scream
To watch each other fall apart (Ooh)
Three Mississippi, you're gone
Sayin' that you're done, you don't want it no more
And four Mississippi, you're home
Like nothin' ever happened at all

Ooh
(No, no, no, no)
Ooh
One Mississippi, you're here
Lovin' me with your whole heart
And two Mississippi, we scream
To watch each other fall apart

One Mississippi, you're here (Here)
Lovin' me with your whole heart (With your whole heart)
And two Mississippi, we scream (Oh)
To watch each other fall apart (Oh)
Three Mississippi, you're gone
Sayin' that you're done, you don't want it no more (You're done, you're done)
And four Mississippi, you're home (Home)
