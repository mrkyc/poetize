You're breakin' up
It can feel like I don't know, but I do
And all I want is somethin' like seein' you smile
Oh, yes, I do

But, you don't have to be here anymore
So whatcha gonna do?
Just go and call it off
But what if I try another way? (Way, way)
Just take a little advice from me

Whatever you do, just don't believe what they say
Whatever you do, just don't believe what they say
'Cause they don't believe you like I believe in you anyway
So whatever you do, whatever you do, babe
Just don't believe what they

Never lie
I'd go to the edge of the line every time for you
Just do what you need, and I know that it's golden
Just take what you want, and leave what you don't
Let the world sink in and stick to your bones

So what if I try another day?
Just take a little advice from me (Ooh, yeah, yeah)

Whatever you do, just don't believe what they say
Whatever you do, just don't believe what they say
'Cause they don't believe you like I believe in you anyway
So whatever you do, whatever you do, babe
Just don't believe what they say, what they say

'Cause I believe in you with all of my heart
Know that it's true, I know it's hard
I believe in you with all of my heart
Know that it's true, I know it's hard
I believe in you with all of my heart
Know that it's true, I know it's hard
I believe in you (I believe in you)
I believe in you

Just don't believe what they say (Ooh yeah, 'cause I believe in you)
What they say (Don't believe in what they say, ooh)
What they say (Ooh, what they say)
