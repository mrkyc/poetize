Unusual, we got mutual friends
Is it mutual if I kiss your lips?
If I'm truthful, then it all depends on your feelings
Crucial, how I'm leanin' in
'Cause I'm used to just divin' in
I could lose you, that's the consequence of my feelings

Is there a spark for us
Or is it just purely platonic?
Is this a story arc?
'Cause if it are, it'd be iconic
I wasn't gonna ask
Afraid of asking you to dance
(But here I am)

Falling for a friend
Falling for a friend, ooh
Baby, don't pretend
That you don't feel it too
I know you do

I wonder if we cross the line
Go under covers, close the blind
Will we be lovers or cut the ties forever?
