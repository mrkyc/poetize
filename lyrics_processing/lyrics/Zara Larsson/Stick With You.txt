Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm

They tell me to let go
To never look back
That you the wrong type
But they don't know you the way that I do
The way that I do
You come from the wrong side
Of all the wrong tracks
But when they say that
I know for sure that I made the right move
I made the right move

Oh, whatever white rabbit you chase
You might get lost or make a mistake
But I ain't gonna leave you for it
You and I agree

We only gonna break up so we can make up
We got the real thing
We call it real love
Even the haters ain't gonna stop us
Baby, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma stick with you
We on the inside
They on the outside
We in a bubble with only good vibes
Nobody knows us the way that we do
Baby, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma stick with you

Hey, we found a wave so let's ride it
Lay back and take your mind where my body is
Tonight, I only wanna shut the world out
It don't get much better than this
I don't really care what they say
You're the blood running through my veins
And if I got you with me
Nothing else should matter, babe

Whatever white rabbit I chase
I might get lost or make a mistake
But you ain't gonna leave me for it
You and I agree

We only gonna break up so we can make up
We got the real thing
We call it real love
