You got that thing that I been looking for
Been running around for so long
Now I caught you, I won't let you go
You got that thing that I been looking for
You got a heart full of gold
And that's really turning me on

You are, you are, you are, you are, you are
Everything that I dreamed of
And now we can paint a picture
You are, you are, you are, you are, you are
Making my life much greener, yeah yeah

Just say you feel the way that I feel
I'm feeling sexual, so we should be sexual
Just say you feel the way that I feel
I'm feeling sexual, so we should be sexual

You got something that I ain't seen before
You've opened a million doors
And all I can say, I adore you
You got something that I ain't seen before
Hold me 'cause, baby, I'm yours
Oh, I can't wait until we get home
