I been living days like they'll never be over
As long as the sky is blue
But if I saw you side of the street, I'd pull over
Do things I thought I'd never do, do

Laying with the windows down
The seats bent back all the way down
Saturday, drive through sunset, music loud
I'm okay

Yeah, I'm happy
I don't need someone
I'm happy, I don't need your love
I'm happy but I want you
Yeah, I'm happy
I don't need someone
I'm happy but I want you

I'm always stuck on the inside
Winter or the summer days (Yeah)
But you look so good in my sunshine
Now I can never look away
