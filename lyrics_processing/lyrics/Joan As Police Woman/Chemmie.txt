When you and I were close
Couldn't make out what you'd done to me
My mind would not let it go
'Cause inside of me
This side of me
Was saying "Oh no, he's got you girl
I think you've found the one"
'Cause we've got chemmie
We got a naughty chemical reaction
Might call it love at first touch
I'm all struck down
Yeah we've got chemmie
An untamed animal attraction
And I'm finding it hard to keep away
From all that's you
So then we stopped this getting to know
And got to getting down
I felt the melt of space and time
??? make me cry
So easily
We found symmetry
And now my body's taking over
I've lost control, I blame my DNA

From all that's you
It doesn't happen every day phenomenon
I can finally safely say
I get along with you
We made it through the eighth dimension
The total ascension
We don't have to die to get to heaven
'Cause we've got chemmie
We got a naughty chemical reaction
