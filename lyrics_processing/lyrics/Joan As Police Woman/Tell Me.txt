Tell me, tell me, tell me - what do you want
Tell me, tell me, tell me - what do you need
Tell me, tell me, tell me - what do you want
Tell me, tell me, tell me - what do you need

You know the sign says "Free Admission"
So what do you say
You can start at the beginning
No one's listening at the door frame
You got to separate now
What's real; what's not real

Tell me, tell me, tell me - what do you want
Tell me, tell me, tell me - what do you need
Tell me, tell me, tell me - what do you want
Tell me, tell me, tell me - what do you need

You know I want the everlasting
So what do you say?
We don't have to write an ending
You know it's all here for the asking
Why don't we separate now
What's real; what's not real
