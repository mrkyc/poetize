An' drove off in that big old Ford
He came back homer that evenin' in a shiny little red thing
An' I heard her whisper: "Oh My Lord."
An she got that look around her mouth that always seemed to settle
When she had a real bad day
I only saw his halo
But she saw his feet of clay
Oh, he loved her and she loved him
In their own peculiar way
I never knew that love had feet of clay
An' she grew up believin', 'cos everybody told her
The world would be a pearl in her hand
So she married her a prince, who swore he'd always love her
And he built her a castle on sand
And the things she never told him when he tried to understand her
Were the things she couldn't say
So she threw away her old glass slippers
'Cos they didn't fit her feet of clay
Oh, he loved her and she loved him
In their own peculiar way
I never knew that love had feet of clay
And the trouble with those feet of clay
When it rains too hard, they melt away
Or hold you fast 'til life has passed you by
Now we've learned that no-one's perfect, and no matter how you try
You're gonna break a heart someday
But still each time I see them, looking in each other's eyes
I wanna be in love that way
'Cos she always wants to meet him when he opens up the door
At the end of every day
With a halo shining in his eyes
Standing on feet of clay
Oh, he loves her and she loves him
In their own peculiar way
As they dance through life together
On their feet of clay
Oh, he loves her and she loves him
In their own peculiar way
As they dance through life together
