I was born on the dawn of a new society
And I feel lucky that my eyes could see
People standing up and being who they want to be
People made the music and the music made them free
And I was just a baby through the summer of love, they say
But it still feels like it was today
And if the road gets rough, I pick up my guitar and play
It's always been right by my side to help me on my way

Now I don't need to worry 'bout tomorrow
Ain't anticipating what's to come
And I don't need to worry 'bout the things I have not done
Long as I got rock and roll I'm forever young

Now we can't always understand this world
Farther along we'll understand it all
The seventies looked like we all were headed for a fall
But those who listened hard enough could hear the summer call
Now I was growing up through all of this
My first beer and love and my first kiss
You never learn the things in school
You learn by living and going through
You taught me how to be myself
How can I thank you?

Now I don't need to worry 'bout tomorrow
Ain't anticipating what's to come
And I don't need to worry 'bout the things I have not done
Long as I got rock and roll I'm forever young
Play a little now

Now I don't need to worry 'bout tomorrow
Ain't anticipating what's to come
And I don't need to worry 'bout the things I have not done
Long as I got rock and roll I'm forever young

And I don't need to worry 'bout tomorrow
Ain't anticipating what's to come
And I don't need to worry 'bout the things I have not done
Long as I got rock and roll I'm forever young
Long as I got rock and roll I'm forever young
