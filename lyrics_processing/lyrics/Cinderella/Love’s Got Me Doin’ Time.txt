Have mercy on a poor boy's heart
'Cause I got the key that can make your motor start
Why can't you love me without messin' me around?
You took everything I got then kick me when I'm down

Ooh, got this funny feeling that you ain't on the level
I looked into those eyes but all I see is the devil
I heard through the vine that you might not be mine
Don't lock me up, I can't pay the fine
Make up your mind before you make me lose mine
Your love's got me doin' time

Have mercy on a poor boy's soul
I've been down so long, never thought I could feel so low
First you love me, then you stab my back
You close the door, turn the key, all I see is black

Ooh, got this funny feeling that you ain't on the level
I look into those eyes but all I see is the devil
I heard through the vine that you might not be mine
Don't lock me up, I can't pay the fine
Make up your mind before you make me lose mine
Your love's got me doin' time
You might also like
Love's got me doin'
Love's got me doin' time
Love's got me doin'
Love's got me doin' time
So what's a poor boy supposed to do
I've done everything I can, it's so true
You got a mean streak like an alley cat
You sucked all the love from me like a vampire bat

Ooh, got this funny feeling that you ain't on the level
I look into those eyes but all I see is the devil
I heard through the vine that you may not be mine
Don't lock me up, I can't pay the fine
Make up your mind before you make me lose mine
Your love's got me doin' time

Love's got me doin'
Love's got me doin' time
Love's got me doin'
Love's got me doin' time
Love's got me doin'
Love's got me doin' time
Love's got me doin'
Love's got me doin' time
Love's got me doin'
Love's got me doin' time
Love's got me doin'
Love's got me doin' time
Love's got me doin'
Love's got me doin' time
Love's got me doin'
