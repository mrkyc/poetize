The world has so much beauty, so much thats worth pursuing
So much I haven't truly discovered yet but, ew we
Believe me I'mma do it, no we can do it excuse me
Still so much to be done, so much that needs undoing
But baby that's the journey, sweetheart don't get discouraged
Cause you the one who told we have a higher purpose
Inside I feel it churning, bubbling below the surface
I feel that under current that pulses towards the merges
The world just keeps on turning, lately I've seen the researches
Compassion, love, and mercy people at each others service
Sweetheart don't get discouraged, one thing I know for certain
Is that we have a higher purpose, higher purpose

I believe in the understanding that there must be something better
When you get down, put head down and pull yourself together
Not looking at anybody else's head for a 
Going to get myself alarmed, I put my head down
I believe in the understanding that there must be something better
When you get down, put head down and pull yourself together
Not looking at anybody else's head for a handout
Going to get myself alarmed, I put my head down, I put my head down

The world has so much malice
The worlds become so violent
Ain't gonna spell it out because we see it all around us
Sometimes I feel so shallow
Sometimes I feel so cold, artificial and metallic
Just when you think it's damaged, beyond the point of salvage
The universe corrects itself, restores the proper balance
The world is just a canvas, different colors on the palate
Talking people getting lighter, other people getting browner
I see the shift your power, I see the world more balanced
I see us as a planet, I don't see us as an island
Sometimes our fate is challenged, thats when we face the mallet
We either we cry about or we proudly make it happen

I believe in the understanding that there must be something better
When you get down, put head down and pull yourself together
Not looking at anybody else's head for a 
Going to get myself alarmed, I put my head down
I believe in the understanding that there must be something better
When you get down, put head down and pull yourself together
Not looking at anybody else's head for a 
Going to get myself alarmed, I put my head down, I put my head down

Don't ever be a victim, don't let yourself drift in
The river of pessimism to the sea of cynicism
The world has so much in it, baby you are much more gifted
Use what you've been given to do what you're intended
That voice that you hear whispering, that voice is intuition
That voice will never diss, do when its speaking listen
Somewhere along the mission we got put into divisions
We focus on whats different and not our common interests
I hear religious figures, they say they on a mission
They say god loves all children, but then they switch positions
They say he has a preference for those who share their vision
Now that don't sound consistent, sounds like they got it twisted
Sometimes I even wonder if they read what is written
My brother needs assistance? My brother has a friendship
Don't care about it preference, complexion, or religion
God is god, love is love. I don't see it any different
I believe in the understanding that there must be something better
When you get down, put head down and pull yourself together
Not looking at anybody else's head for a 
Going to get myself alarmed, I put my head down
I believe in the understanding that there must be something better
When you get down, put head down and pull yourself together
Not looking at anybody else's head for a 
Going to get myself alarmed, I put my head down, I put my head down
I put my head down
I put my head down
I put my head down
I put my head down
I put my head down
Head down
Head down
