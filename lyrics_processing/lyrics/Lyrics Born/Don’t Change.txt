Don't change the way you do thangs
Don't change

Don't change the way you do it baby
Don't change the way you walk
Don't change the way you talk
Don't change the way you do your thing
Don't change the way you are

Don't change the way you scrape
Don't change the way you do your thang
Don't change into what you ain't baby

I heard them say I wouldn't amount to much
I heard them say I couldn't cut it and my album sucked
Cause I was too experimental
Played around too much
Just because I wasn't doing all average stuff
But now my peoples always knew I was bound to bust
And when they see me on the streets give me pounds and hugs
Cause I stuck to my guns I'm about the funk
I can't help myself that's the sound I love
Then one by one I tore down the clubs
And when I stepped on stage the whole house erupt
Slap so hard I should've won the Stanley Cup
See I like to drink a little talk loud and stuff
Because I'm outspoken that's just the town I'm from
I got hella pair of jeans I ain't counted up
And these gators set me back a couple thousand bucks
But you know, that's what it is baby that's wassup

I had big dreams but always lacked the wealth
Just took a little bit to get them off the ground
Along the way cats offered me an ounce of help
I could've been all in I'm talking pounds and up
A ten year bid over a thousand 
That's less than McDonalds bruh
If you stretch that out it don't amount to much
And that's just mad wrong baby add it up
Not bad for a kid that flunked algebra
But nothing wrong with my numbers now
Because I always knew how I felt about myself
I learned early on this ain't for powder puffs
It's a thing man if you got talent son
You gonna always have haters that doubt you bruh
It's on to you them to show them that they was out to touch
And they shouldn't mess with you they was out to lunch
