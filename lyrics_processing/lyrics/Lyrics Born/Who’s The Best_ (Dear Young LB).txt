I wanna say a couple things
One, you are a lovely being
You will succeed undoubtedly
There's only one of me
Life ain't potpourri and bumblebees
But you are not the enemy
You are just a different breed
Think different
Speak different
Go on baby, be different
Rigid definition ain't caught up to where you be at present
How people receive you or see you
Has more to do with who they are, not who you are
Deep breaths
At times you will be ridiculed
At other times minuscule
At times you gone get blamed
For a gang of shit you didn't do
When things ain't in alignment
Just keep your hands at 10 and 2
Remember who the fuck you are
You incredible
Incredible
Incredible
Incredible
Incredible

Be careful with yourself
I said be gentle with yourself
Always protect your mental health
Don't be afraid to ask for help
If they listen or they notice
Stay persistent and stay focused
Cuz the world ain't up to speed on who we are yet as a culture
At times you feel excluded
I know it gets confusing
Because there is no blueprint for what you will do in music
Continue doing you
Pursue your truth
Baby do it
You an amazing human
Let the spirit guide your movement
Funkiest rapper alive and you will be 'till you die
Forgive yourself for the things you did just to survive
You were given problems kids were never meant to solve
Moving forward you ain't got to be that way at all
At all
At all
At all

Be present in your dealings
With your peoples and your bidness
And when you give your opinion
Just be real about your feelings
Say what you mean exactly
Take the space you need
To let you breathe
Don't ever be afraid to dream extravagantly
Everything you yearning for
You worthy and deserving of
Your journey is your journey baby
Don't be in a hurry bruh
I will always love you
I love seeing you become you
When you pull up look inside
I'll be right here waiting on you
On you
On you
