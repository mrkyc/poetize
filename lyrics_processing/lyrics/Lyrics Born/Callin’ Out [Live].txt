And it's good that y'all could make it to my new meeting
Take you time, grab a table we got booth seating
Now allow me introduce me to my new people
(What's your name)
From the past, from the future, from the new and recent
Don't believe you can read page one in you leaflet
L Y R C is funk philly born baby
Top of the echelon of MCing
I think on the topic we all in agreement
Never running from a challenge, never been sheepish
In the rap all the fame we gotta get me in
You gotta see me do my thang son I'm too fiendish
Flinging tune after tune till the wound deepens
I have a rumor human thing, it's feeling wousy like a fiend
Lead me move you to the music and the fever screaming baby

Callin' out to all area crew

We gonna make this shit happen right here right now
My life's a combination of my past achievements
With a lotta heavy lifting, lotta deep breathing
Lotta courage, lotta doubts and lotta mixed feelings
Lotta love, a lotta luggage for a lotta reasons
I ain't forgot about the pain and all the mistreatments
I ain't forgot the little box they try to wiggle me in
I ain't forgot about the flower deep underneath the crowded streets
Sprouting in between the cracks see me shout baby
Follow like a lock in, in the Coliseum
You can positive, I think I'm in the mausoleum
Think I'll ever hang it up, oh, body stop dreaming
Think I'll ever stop, oh baby, now you're reaching
I won't stop till I feel my lungs stop breathing
I won't stop till I feel my heart stop beating
I won't stop speaking this week and next week
And all folks, steep singing, hot dogs
Stop seeing, five freezing, ice heating, fire palms, reading all fat fall
Freak clear from the mountain tops screaming, baby
Callin' out to all area crew
We gonna make this shit happen right here right now
Callin' out to all area crew
We gonna make this shit happen right here right now
Callin' out to all area crew
We gonna make this shit happen right here right now
Callin' out to all area crew
We gonna make this shit happen right here right now
Melbourne are you ready, let's start the show

Get it on, getting it on, on and on
Don't worry 'bout the present day, he can't stop us now
Get it on, get it on, we 'bout to get it on
Get it on, getting it on, on and on
Callin' out to all area crew
