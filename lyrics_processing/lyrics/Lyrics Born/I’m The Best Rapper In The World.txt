I'm the best rapper in the world
I'm the best rapper
The very best rapper
I'm the best rapper in the world
I'm the best rapper in the world
I'm the best rapper in the world
I'm the best rapper
There ain't no better rapper
Cuz I'm the best rapper in the world
One in a gazillion
I been superior
How many millenniums?
Both!
Oh I'm so different
Cultured and brilliant
Outspoken resilient
Yo!
Cold Like a penguin's
Nose, toes and titty nipple
The Voice of many people
All of my affiliates
Black, brown, indigenous
Golden and vanilla
Let's go!
You might also likeI need some property
I need a marketing team
I need the same opportunities as Robin & Steve
The same opportunities as Holly & Bree
Don't argue about my fee
Or my competency
I need to work with people who are smarter than me
I know, I know, I know
That's kind of hard to believe
I know, I know, I know
That's kind of hard to conceive
To find people like minded
In the highest degree
Your team is all bark
No teeth and no chin
Yo team is all bark
Like a tree with no limbs
Took an old police car
Caprice with no rims
Added beat and a top
And she worth M's
That's the theme of my life
I see what they didn't
Add seasoning and sauce
LB reinvented
Flows and these bars write themselves with no pens
Baby these ain't just songs
These are dreams that we live
Old beliefs and old norms are things I don't respect
I will pee on your carpet
I don't give a shit!
Drippy like ...
Crispy like ...
Slick fits and ice
Shimmer like LeCroi
I filled the whole void
For those with no voice
I'm a little off-center but still I'm on point
When it comes to my coin
I'm greedy like oink
Undefeated in whatever I may weather like Floyd
Can't fuck with the boy
That ain't beef that's soy
I'm a genius
Doy
Big fish
The koi
Then one night
I asked myself why?
Why am I so tight?
Why am I so fly?
I hit the whole joint
Then I hit another joint
Then I got hella high
And it hit me like boink
I'm the best rapper in the world
I'm the best rapper in the world
I'm the best rapper
The very best rapper
I'm the best rapper in the world
I'm the best rapper in the world
I'm the best rapper in the world
I'm the best rapper
There ain't no better rapper
