Scared of you
Scared of you
Girl I'm scared of you
Scared of you
Scared of you
Scared of you
Girl I'm Scared of you
Scared of you
This joint a mood piece
Moonlit Miles Davis kinda blue theme
Ooh she so special, so unique
A true queen
Baby girl reigning supreme
It's a reason that she choose me
Because I do thangs
You only see in movies
A true freak
Help you get out your routine
Between two sheets creamy like a smoothie
This joint a mood piece
Moonlit, baby take off my jewelry
Pull off your top like a shoestring
Tear your blue jeans
Like paper from a loose leaf
Over and over like two fiends
Up and down like mood swings
Left to right like fruit trees
Back to back like the G's in Gucci

This joint a cherry bomb
Very warm in your belly like Sauvignon
Turn me on every time we're alone
Sh-Shake it up
Pop it like Dom Perignon
Baby warm baby soft like terry cloth
Baby legs wide open like a parasol
Everything we do hella wrong
Take her arms and drive it on home like a chariot
Round and round like a peloton
Both sides like stereo
Run it up like a marathon
Tearing down your caramel walls like jericho
Run it up like a marathon
Do not play games with me
I did not come to play
You can't hang with me
Get lit up, lit up girl
