This is big money talk, it's so electrifying
This is big money talk, it's so mesmerizing
This is big money talk, it's devastating
This is big money talk, hard work
Verse 1:
Competition is zip, zero, zilch I'm talking nada, none, nill
Ya'll tiny little squad can't deal with Lyrics Born
It's like I'm walking on stilts, balling full tilt
Ya'll really gone small like billiard balls
I'm a giant coming down from the hills
Stompin opposition peel em off of my heel
With my hundred dollar bill now pass me the pill
I'll have women in the building giggling at you in stiches for real
I'm not playing, laying claim to the floor
You ain't game with your A-game you gets rained on
Vacate the place man cause you can't hang, stay off the paint
Stay along the bass line like reggae, hey hey hey
Lyrics Born is back again dismantlin' your man's and them
Throwin to the mattresses I'm servin ass whippin's
Like Shirley serving sandwiches
What's happenin

I'll pummel your team, crumble your team
Disassemble your team, publically humble your team
It's not a thing, come and meet you with a crushing defeat, know what I mean?
You'll be kicking rocks mumbling things, I'm the king
Real hustlas don't knuckle under but buckle under pressure
We pump it up and come with something aggressive
Ball one hundred percent or not at all, men in character
With pockets stuffed like Snuffleuppagus trunk with a temperature
Boom stacks on the table, banded and manicured
Ya'll can count it out but my manhood is accurate
Ain't the place for you to wager what you can't honor
I put the emphasis on bills not drama
What I got in my right pocket will pay off your Porche
What I got in my left pocket will pay off your mortgage
What I got in your eye socket will clear up the argument
What we got is much less in common than you think be cautious

Verse 3:
My legacy will ring out throughout history
Since infancy I came out, threw down viciously
Ya'll memory will fade out, blow out histamine
Ain't nothing more to say about you clowns really
I'm so over the critics, I'm so focused on winning
My soul motive is victory, so devoted to discipline
With my national prospect, tracking my progress
A child of the projects who will add all the smartness
I'm cashing the gorgeous fattest checks on the market
My staff just went bonkers at my management office
A passionate art the way I capture the audience
With stamina and endurance son, the package is flawless
Catch my performance it ain't hard to argue
Why I landed in stardom, my value's enormous
When you got it you got it man, I can't even call it
Ain't really more to say about me now, chorus
