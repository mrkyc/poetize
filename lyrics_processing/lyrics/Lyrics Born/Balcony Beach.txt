Ooo baby
We can make it happen
Make it through baby
All we need to do is begin rejuvenating
Keep it all in focus and pursue it faithfully
Do it patiently

Just the way the sea's been this evening
I came out at eight, was leaning on the railing
I kept hearing the waves crashing beneath me
Back and forth, just rephrase what they were saying
Over and over, and doing that repeatedly
Crash, go back, just a constant thing
Every time they'd go back out to sea
It's like they'd draw a little bit more out of me
A lot of images, feelings - just a limitless release
And I began to reminisce freely
It was a cinema featuring me and a cast of emotions
That demanded my attention immediately
Now, I had previously put them on hold
On the back burner since earlier
I didn't want to deal with it
At that time, I felt like other things were pertinent
Now I see it's permanent unless I get real with it
And it ain't that I don't love to tussle
Especially mentally, cause I generally do win
Might not win at first, but definitely eventually
Cause I ain't never not been a shoe-in since birth
But now, this is special though, see, it's beyond my threshold
I'm accustomed to just a conventional struggle with two opponents
Only here, the tussle's between you and the truth
So ultimately I'm gonna lose
Actually I gain though, I gotta be honest with myself
Or else I'll impede my personal progress
I think it's better to be depressed for a minute, admit it
And get re-oriented instead of being a bitter cynic, isn't it?

Getting older, and everybody around me acts all sober
And they're looking poker-faced
I started losing hair at the corners, matter-of-fact
I looked up top - that whole border's just jacked
Nobody's gonna chauffeur me anymore
Whatever this is... we all go through it I guess
It's just awkward - I'm not a hundred percent comfortable with
The rate that everything's developing at
It's just a little overwhelming at times
I'm dealing with hella shit to process, it's new data daily
There's really no preparing for this thing
Or, maybe it's mainly just me acting strangely
It's just me facing the challenge, I doubt it though
Cause I met thousands of people, seen something similar in their faces
It's like the outlook is changing
I think it's called 'being a man in the making'
It's burnt, I like Pralines now
Long walks solo where I can sort my thoughts out
Just what I've been taught to date
Doesn't gel well, the way that I've been feeling these days
That's coming from a ton of angles, you know, hella places
I'm really not trying to make a political statement
But just in terms of like internally inside
I'm at an interval in my life where it's a turbulent time
And I could pretend that it's all good
That I shouldn't put so much on it
Let it sit and just settle itself, stop acting all sappy and sentimental
Besides, everything's perfectly fine
But here I am on this balcony with my thoughts just traveling randomly
On some tangent, and in the back of my mind
I keep hearing this lady with a voice that's beautiful
She keeps saying
Ooo baby
We can make it happen
Make it through baby
All we need to do is begin rejuvenating
Keep it all in focus and pursue it faithfully
