Woke up in the middle of the night, cold sweat
Eyes stinging, no breath, legs clinging to the bedside
Hard pressed just to get a little rest every night
Same shit can't remember last time that I slept right
This situation's gotten out of control
With all this stress and confrontation I just might overload
My problems follow me to sleep at night won't let me go
The more I hide the more they thrive deep down inside of my soul
Listen
Got burnt by women, partners in business
Landlords and tenants, got served by creditors
We have 'em, depressions
We can't keep dwelling on problems
Close relatives, past friendships don't last
No benefits plan, wrote a letter to my senator
We have 'em, depressions
We can't keep dwelling on problems
This situation's gotten out of control (hey hey hey)
With all this stress and confrontation I just might overload (hey hey hey)
My problems follow me to sleep at night won't let me go (hey hey hey)
The more I hide the more they thrive deep down inside of my soul
Sing it

Shit, now I lay me down to sleep
Please god let it end once again let me live life
We have 'em, depressions
We can't keep dwelling on problems
'Cause I can't do another long dance with a ghost
See my head wanna come around half past midnight
We have 'em, depressions
We can't keep dwelling on problems
This situation's gotten out of control (hey hey hey)
With all this stress and confrontation I just might overload (hey hey hey)
My problems follow me to sleep at night won't let me go (hey hey hey)
The more I hide the more they thrive deep down inside of my soul
We have 'em, depressions
We can't keep dwelling on problems
