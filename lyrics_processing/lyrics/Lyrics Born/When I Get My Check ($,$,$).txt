When I get my check, ladies and gentlemen
I'm about to buy a real prehistoric Stegosaurus skeleton
And put it right in my living room as a centerpiece
And right over everyone
My homeless homeboys and celebrities
Serve medical edibles, bottles of Moscato, octopus tentacles
And American cheese
About to open "LB's Exotic Petting Zoo", betty boop
Watering tropical flowers in a kitty suit, panthers and Bengals, Leopards and pterodactyls
A flock of neon peacocks, my spirit animal
Twenty pair of leather pants in every color imaginable
Matching feather hats because I'm so fashionable
Pay for my own presidential campaign
Janis, James Brown, Jimi Hendrix can play
We'll go skinny dipping In a lake of champagne
Anything can happen, baby
When I get paid

Ooo Ooo
Around the world in 48 bars
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money (all it takes is)
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money (all I really need is)
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money (all it takes is)
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money

When I get my check, I'm going on a world cruise
On a boat made of produce, full of whirlpools
And a thousand-inch flatscreen to watch the world news
And a personal chef to cook up all the morsels
Buy a crib out in Holly Grove 5th, next to a molly plant
Where I get to frolic in the sun, drinking cognac
The world is my oyster like stories like an almanac
50 Rolls Royces just to floss on your Pontiac
Exotic ass woman wanna holler, yea I'll holler back
Show 'em to my bed and never show them where my wallet's at
Got a mad do, coming through
Wearin' baller ass suits, unavailable to you
Cuz you're not as extravagant as me
Ten G's on my breakfast
Hundred-thou on my night in town, living reckless
I would love to sit and talk but I got a call to do
With important people about some important things that don't concern you

Now, when I get my check, I'll pay my family's debt
I mean every last one of 'em, heavy cash
So none of them could say that I was cheap or frugal
Money so deep that Google keeps my reps off the GPS
I would discreetly test at the base of Mnt. Fuji
Where volcanic magma heats my jacuzzi
To keep my security foolproof;
Mutated silverback killer gorillas in full suits and moon boots
My bathtub would be a large round pool
My martial arts instructor would be Ra's al Ghul
My doorbell would ring like a large cow's moo
With the sound engineered to make it all sound cool
Prime the satellite for internet hotspot, sir
And wall to wall carpets, made from real sasquatch fur, ha
This is a wholla upper echelon spot when I get paid
I smoking gold from a leprechaun's pot, let's go
