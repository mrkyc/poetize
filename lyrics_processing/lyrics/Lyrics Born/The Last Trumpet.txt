Lamentations, lamentations, lamentations worldwide

Watch out (repeated)

In the beginning men and women had an obligation to their children
Then there was a real and true necessity in need for building
There was still the discipline and will proliferate the lineage
Matters of the spirit, mind, and body taken serious
But the way that we became what we became
Somebody please explain
Well we could tell you if you're curious
Those that reign got the masses in chains
And their minds enslaved
And that's the part that makes me furious

Watch out (repeated)
'Cause there definitely ain't no info readily available
To the general lay-people so let me know
'Cause there definitely ain't no info readily available
To the general lay-people so let me know

It's easily this multimedia crews that feed you to the neediest
It's the greediest trying to cheat us out of our God given right
To a quality education, minimal opportunities available
Limited occupations, we are not given a choice
Or given a voice within a political system, pimped and gangsta'd out
Wherein the people are the victim sheep being lead about
While the followers and patrons of any faith outside the mainstream
All being branded, falsely painted as endangering the way things work
And the way things are remain
I can't believe that things ain't worse
When all the wicked seeds we've sown have grown
And poisoned all the Earth
It serves us right
Can't really act surprised when the harvest has no worth
The curse that lurks around the corner
Is the product of our work

Watch out (repeated)

But he who stands alone with justice none touches
