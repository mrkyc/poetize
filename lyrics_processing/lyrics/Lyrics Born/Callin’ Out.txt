I wanna welcome y'all to house of who-the-hell-he-is
And it's cool that y'all could make it to my new meeting
So take you time, grab a table, we got booth seating
Now allow me, introduce me to my new people
See my name is Lyrics Born, baby and I truly mean it
From the past from the future from the new and recent
You don't believe you can read it, page one in your leaflet
L-Y-R-I-C-S funk-feelin' Born baby
Top of the echelon of MCing
And I think on the topic we all in agreement
I'm never running from a challenge, never been sheepish
In the rap hall of fame we gotta get me in
You gotta see me do my thang, son I'm too fiendish
Flinging tune after tune 'til the wound deepens
I have a room of human beings feeling woozy like a fiend
Leaning, moving to the music in a fever screaming baby

My life's a culmination of my past achievements
With a lot of heavy lifting, lot of deep breathing
A lot of courage, lot of doubts, a lot of mixed feelings
A lot of love, a lot of luggage for a lot of reasons
I ain't forgot about the pain and all the mistreatment
I ain't forgot the little box they try to wiggle me in
I ain't forgot about the flower deep underneath the crowded streets
Sprouting in between the cracks, scream and shout baby
Follow like a lock-in in the Colosseum
And you can positive ID him I'm in the mausoleum
You think I'll ever hang it up, oh money stop dreaming
You think I'll ever stop, oh baby now you're reaching
I won't stop 'til I feel my lungs stop breathing
I won't stop 'til I feel my heart stop beating
I won't stop speaking this week and next week
And all false teeth, seeing eye dog
Stop seeing, fire freezing, ice heat and fire palms reading
All bad fall free and clear from the mountain top screaming baby
Callin' out to all area crew
We gon' make this shit happen right here, right now
