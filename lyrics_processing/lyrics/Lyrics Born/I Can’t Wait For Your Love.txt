I can't be worried 'bout, all the fellas, little sad commas
They all think that they experts, and yet they got drama
I love 'em, they my partners but tommorow's not promised
And life is too short to really not do it big
And I can't live it, thinkin' what I could or should've did
'Cause at some point, you really gotta take that leap of faith
And do exactly what your homeboy said wasn't safe
'Cause I really do believe that God awards risk
Especially with love man, 'cause that's the hardest shit
To give yourself a hundred percent in this partnership
For a lot of people, that's just a little hard to give
But if it feels right, it clicks and everything's legit
We could have it for a minute, ain't nobody really trip
And in your heart you say, it can't get deeper than this
Then there really ain't no reason why it shouldn't be it
I can't wait for your love
I can't wait for your love
I can't wait for your love
I can't wait for your love
They say that man choose with their eyes, women choose with their ears
Whatever choice it was we made, brought us here
Some decisions we make out of faith, some out of fear
Sometimes it's so confusin', we don't know which way to steer
You might also likeSome of us have been through so much in life already
That we totally lost, the desire to feel anything
Ice cold below, the fire below senegrate
Behind ninety foot walls, that can't nobody penetrate
A lot of cats out there was damaged
They feel they gotta act a certain way, otherwise there ain't manership
A lotta women got issues with trust
'Cause the man that they love had bounced on 'em more than once
But you know we all been there, it's not that bomb at all
Just chop it as a loss, get back up and walk it off
Can't wave the white flag, can't throw in the towel
Love is a limited time offer, act now
I can't wait for your love
I can't wait for your love
I can't wait for your love
I can't wait for your love
Can you hear me?
I'm callin'
Can you hear me?
I'm callin'
Can you hear me?
I'm callin'
Can you hear me?
There ain't no love in your love, then that's some sad ass shit
This woman I got, she the bad ass shit
That's no exageration, man I'm sayin' she was true
Other women walk by, they go bow, Wince and Lue
I'm committed but now, I'm not blind, I been around
Believe me when I tell ya she shoppin' 'em all down
And I really don't know where I'd be without her
But when I say that, I don't stutter, mutter or slur
'Cause many times I was lost, with my focus at a side
Every time, there she was, pointin' at the finish line
There ain't never been a moment where she was in need
I wasn't right there with her, goin' at the same speed
What makes it so beautiful and unusual is that it's mutual
And if the two of use are gonna have a future, that's crucial
Rest assure, I ain't goin' nowhere
And I ain't sayin' that just 'cause she's right here
I can't wait for your love
I can't wait for your love
I can't wait for your love
I can't wait for your love
I can't wait for your love
I can't wait for your love
I can't wait for your love
