I don't care where you're from
The first time that I saw you girl, you had me sprung
Just the way that my name rolls off your tongue
Damn near knocked all the wind out my lungs
Baby girl, you the one, you the maximum
You got every man beggin' for scraps and crumbs
I can't front, I want it all in one lump sum, but girl you got me sittin' on my hands and thumbs
I ain't done
Girl you got the magic touch
You seen every man out here and passed him up, except one
Baby girl that's what's up
I can't wait for the day when we hangin' tough, I said...
I'm not sure what you did to me, but I like it, I love it
Oh, I'm not sure what you did to me, but I like it, I love it
Said I'm not sure what you did to me, but I like it, I love it
Oh, I'm not sure what you did to me, but I like it, I love it

I don't care what they say, I'm a ride for you girl and that's how it's gon' stay
As long as we together girl, I can't complain
If they talk, let 'em talk, how I feel won't change
Top notch
Baby girl you're off the charts, and when God made you, you know he made a work of art
I wanna be with you, girl, from the finish to the start
From dusk 'til dawn, and from morning 'til dark
Oh my God
Whenever we apart, it's like a poison dart shot thru my heart
Real talk
Baby girl you're all I want
Not with some, not with part, but with all my heart, girl...

Girl you look so good, I wanna drive it on home like a nail through wood
Girl you look so nice, every time you walk by you make a man look twice
Girl you look so fine, wanna say so much, can you make a little time?
Girl you look so cute, women gettin' at me just to get at you
I'm not sure what you did to me, but I like it, I love it
Oh, I'm not sure what you did to me, but I like it, I love it
Said I'm not sure what you did to me, but I like it, I love it
