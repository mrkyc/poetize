When you lie
Kiss your baby bye bye bye
And if you're true
The whole wide world will laugh with you
When we see
Nothing's wrong with you and me
With you time will tell
It might even bring a wedding bell
And if you think that I'm a loser
Well you suck, cause you know I ain't nothin' but a user
Of your love, can't get enough
Girl it's true, the whole wide world is smilin' with you

Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up
Push th' little daisies and make 'em come up

Sometimes I know
Sometimes I'm on the go
But I'm comin' back
So don't give me no flack
It's all you
And it's me too
It's your world
You's the girl, you's the girl
Happier than shit
Things that might go click with me
Click with you
Is that love? Is that love? Oh

Watch them grow watch them grow
