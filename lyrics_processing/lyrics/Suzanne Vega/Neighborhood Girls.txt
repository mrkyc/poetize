"We had our neighborhood girl
She used to hang out in front of McKinsey's Bar
And we were interested in her and her clientele
We just wonder where she's gone"
"Oh, she's gone?"
"Yes, she's gone, gone, gone"
"Yes, she's gone, gone, gone"

"I think I know your neighborhood girl
She lives on my street now with eyes of ice
I've seen her in the morning when she is walking in the sun
And I always thought that she looked kind of nice
She spoke to me once at a party, I think
And I thought at the time that she had had too much to drink
Because she said to me, 'There's a backbone gone
And I've got to get it back before going on'"

"Well, your neighborhood girl, she seems to have resigned
She was looking out at people from the back of her mind
And before she went off she spoke to me again
She came up and said, 'You have the eyes of a friend
And there's a razor's edge that I have lost somewhere
And I would like it back so if you've seen it anywhere
I've been out for a while but I'll be back in a bit
I am just walking through the smoke finding out if this is it'"

"''Cause I've got this feeling that things are going grey
And I'd like to hear a straight line to help me find my way'
I looked at her and I did not know what to say
She had long black hair"

"Must be a different neighborhood girl
'Cause ours had blonde hair in front of McKinsey's Bar
And we were interested in her and her clientele
We just wonder where she's gone"
"Oh, she's gone?"
"Yes, she's gone, gone, gone"
