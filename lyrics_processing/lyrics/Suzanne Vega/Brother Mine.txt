Sonny boy, you need new sneakers
I'd better go into town and get them Friday night
Come to think of it, kid
You need just about everything
But I think everything will be all right

So you went and got yourself back into trouble
Went and got yourself into another fight
Come on here, let me see your eye
Now it's all black and swollen
But I think everything will be all right
Yes, I think that you're gonna be all right

I don't know why you're such a troublemaker
You'd think that maybe by now you'd see the light
Getting yourself torn up, boy
And we don't have much money
But I think everything will be all right
Yes, I think everything will be all right

Now maybe I shouldn't yell 'cause I know you're just a kid
But I can't always tell what's on your mind half the time
Brother mine

Now I know that you're just my little brother
And I don't expect you to get everything just right
But I think you ought to use
A little more sense than what you're using
And maybe then things would be all right
Yes, maybe then things would be all right

Now I know that I sit and I worry too much
Especially when you come home such a sight
But I guess what you've got to do, boy
You go ahead and do it
And I sure hope things will be all right
Yes, I hope everything will be all right

Now come back here, you scruffy little brother
Come on back here, let me kiss you goodnight
'Cause I know if you were gone
That I'd miss the sound of laughter
That's gonna make everything all right
