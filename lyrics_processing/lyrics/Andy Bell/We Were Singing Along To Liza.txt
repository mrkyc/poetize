We were singing along to Liza
My mom bust in I couldn't hide ya
But we were gay did not surprise her
Thirty  years ago she said
Love is where it falls
God's will the thrills of your life are just beginning
I hope it will be just as fulfilling
Thirty years from now

Mom's gone and liza slowing
But i'm stood here steadfast knowing
The years between you came to be my
All and everything
And that all and everything
Is still you by my side
And all I think and dare to do
Is still you we were not beaten we didn't cry
My focus from that day hence why i'm not living a lie
Could have been broken could have been ashamed
But her love from discovering  change
But she was so enlightened
Stopped me from being frightened
Of all the feelings that I had
I couldn't change
And though she's long gone
My love for her remains
Of an understanding mother
Who said nothing could surprise her
That she had really seen it all
When he was singing along to Liza

Love is where it falls
God's will the thrills of your life are just beginning
I hope it will be just as fulfilling
Thirty years from now

That Thirty years is now
That Thirty years is now
Here I am

But we were gay did not surprise her
