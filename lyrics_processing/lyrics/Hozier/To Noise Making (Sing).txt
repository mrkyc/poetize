Remember when you'd sing just for the fuck of it?
Any joy it would bring, honey, the look of it
Was as sweet as the sound
Your head tilt back, your funny mouth to the clouds
I couldn't hope to know that song or know its words
Wouldn't claim to feel the same we felt the first time it was heard
I couldn't name that feeling carried in that voice
Was it that or just the act of makin' noise that brought you joy?

You don't have to sing it right
But who could call you wrong?
To put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice but, honey, sing it strong
At best, you'll find a little remedy
At worst, the world will sing along

So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing

Remember when you'd sing before we'd move to it?
And we'd scuff up our shoes
Honey, the groove of it was whatever you choose
"I Wanna Be Your Lover" or "The Fisherman's Blues"

You didn't always sing it right
But who could call you wrong?
To put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice but, honey, sing it strong
At best, you'll find a little remedy
At worst, the world will sing along

So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing

Who could ask you be unbroken or be brave again?
Or, honey, hope even on this side of the grave again
And who could ask you to be sound or to feel saved again?
But stick around until you hear that music play again
So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing (Remember when you'd sing just for the love of it?)
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing (Just for the love of it)
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Remember when you'd sing just for the love of it?
