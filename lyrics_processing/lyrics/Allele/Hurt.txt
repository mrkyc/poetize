I guess that means I lie to you
Curious and always wrong
There's a place I found to hide
From the past that keeps me right
Beside what I can become
But I can't take no more
Stop the fight!
Cause I can't change an open door for you
And tell me why does it hurt to know the truth
Stop the fight!
If ever it is over you can say
It's my fault, not always, will it hold you?
Your reactions force the lie
It's cold just come inside
I'll answer all I can
But I hope it works tonight
Cause I know something's not right
Trying to find just what we lost
How to hold on tight
You might also likeStop the fight!
Cause I can't change an open door for you
And tell me why does it hurt to know the truth
Stop the fight!
If ever it is over you can say
It's my fault, not always, will it break you?
One last breath!
We find the weak and just
Hold on tight (waiting for the break!)
Why does it hurt so much?
Why does it hurt to trust?
Why does it hurt to love?
Why does it hurt when you're the one?
Why does it hurt so much?
Why does it hurt to trust?
Why does it hurt to love?
Why does, why does it hurt?!
Why does it hurt?
Why does, why does it hurt?!
Stop the fight!
Cause I can't change an open door for you
And tell me why does it hurt to know the truth
Stop the fight!
If ever it is over you can say
It's my fault, not always, will it hold you?
Why does it hurt so much?
Why does it hurt to trust?
Why does it hurt so much?
Why does it hurt to trust?
Why does it hurt so much?
