He said you best be gettin' on the road
And grab your coat it's gettin' cold
You know I'm gonna miss you
Don't get below a quarter tank
That gas burns quicker than you think
Oh and always check that rear view
Watch your speed at the Georgia line
Those boys will get you every time
And it's a hundred dollar fine

Drive like the devil
When you see an open highway
And let off that pedal
When a good view steals your breath away
Take a left if it feels right
Roll your windows down at night
You may get lost but you'll be alright
There's a bible on the dash
And a map tucked in the door
I can't be your backseat driver anymore

Here's to hopin' you won't need
That baseball bat behind the seat
But it's there if you ever do
And call home every couple days
If only for your mama's sake
Hell she tells all her friends about you
Now ten and two, buckle up
I threw a flashlight in the trunk
Next to that spare if you get stuck
You might also like
Drive like the devil
When you see an open highway
And let off that pedal
When a good view steals your breath away
Take a left if it feels right
Roll your windows down at night
You may get lost but you'll be alright
There's a bible on the dash
And a map tucked in the door
I can't be your backseat driver anymore
Anymore, I can't be your backseat driver anymore

Sometimes when I'm lost, I can still hear
My daddy's voice echo loud and clear

Drive like the devil
When you see an open highway
And let off that pedal
When a good view steals your breath away
Take a left if it feels right
Roll your windows down at night
You may get lost but you'll be alright
There's a bible on the dash
And a map tucked in the door
I can't be your backseat driver anymore
I can't be your backseat driver anymore
Anymore, I can't be your backseat driver anymore
No, I can't, you know I can't
