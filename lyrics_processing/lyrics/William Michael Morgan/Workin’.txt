Boombox on the toolbox
AM hittin' that sweet spot
Red bandana and a white t-shirt
Me and this tractor pushin' up dirt
Carhartts and a shocked up chainsaw
Sweat drippin' off this Resistol
Damned it I ain't my daddy's son
If I don't do it, it don't get done

I'm workin' in this hot sun
Workin' like a man
I'm workin' on this cold one
Right here in my hand
But when it's time to kick my boots off
I don't just hit the hay
I start workin' on my real job
Pullin' down them shades

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, Sunday too
If I ain't workin' outside this house
I'm inside workin' on you
And it's workin'
Yeah baby, it's workin'
You might also like
It's kinda hard not watchin' you swingin' on that porch swing
Checking me out doing my thing
Bare feet up, a little red wine
Waitin' on me to cal quittin' time

I'm workin' in this hot sun
Workin' like a man
I'm workin' on this cold one
Right here in my hand
But when it's time to kick my boots off
I don't just hit the hay
I start workin' on my real job
Pullin' down them shades

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, Sunday too
If I ain't workin' outside this house
I'm inside workin' on you
And it's workin'
Yeah, yeah baby, it's workin'

Yeah there's always something 'round here
Something else to do
But baby, it ain't work at all
If your lovin' what you do
Yeah I'm workin' in this hot sun
Workin' like a man
I'm workin' on this cold one
Right here in my hand
But when it's time to kick my boots off
I don't just hit the hay
I start workin' on my real job
Pullin' down them shades

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, Sunday too
If I ain't workin' outside this house
I'm inside workin' on you
And it's workin'
Yeah, yeah baby, it's workin'

I keep the big wheels turnin'
You keep the home fires burnin'
Every kiss I get I'm earnin'
Whatever it is, it's workin'
I keep the big wheels turnin'
You keep the home fires burnin'
Every kiss I get I'm earnin'
