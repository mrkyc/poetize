If you like that car you're ridin' in
Yeah, the Chevrolet or the Mercedes-Benz
If the road is paved you're drivin' on
That leads you to the house you call your home
If there's wires in the wall and there's paint on the porch
You got a whole lot to be thankful for

Thank a beer drinker, a beer drinker
Somebody got somethin' done, brother
You can figure it's a beer drinker and an old ball cap
Dirt on his hands and an ache in his back
So let's give it up for the guys on the clock
That work all week and then twist one off
Thank a beer drinker

And if you like that steak you're bitin' into
Or if your hot tub's hot, if your A/C's cool
If your roof don't leak and your fridge is filled
With stuff shipped in on eighteen wheels
When you push that button, when you flip that switch
If it all comes on without a hitch

Thank a beer drinker, a beer drinker
Somebody got somethin' done, brother
You can figure it's a beer drinker and an old ball cap
Dirt on his hands and an ache in his back
So let's give it up for the guys on the clock
That work all week and then twist one off
Thank a beer drinker
You might also like
Yeah, I'll stop here 'cause the list is long
Just one last thing if you like this song
Thank a beer drinker
Oh, I'm a beer drinker, are you a beer drinker

Oh, thank a beer drinker, a beer drinker
Somebody got somethin' done, brother
You can figure it's a beer drinker and an old ball cap
Dirt on his hands and an ache in his back
So let's give it up for the guys on the clock
That work all week and give us all we got
Thank a beer drinker
