I'm talkin' to a girl right now
Thought I'd forgotten how
It feels good just hangin' out
And that's enough
She's easy on the eyes
She's got a wild side
Best it's been in a long time
And that ain't sayin' much

But I'm talkin' to a girl
I'm startin' to see
The sun still shines
Some signs of life after you and me
Yeah I'm takin' it a day-
At-a-time these days
'Cause I'm in a better place
No I wouldn't say I'm on top of the world

But I'm talkin' to a girl who knows
What it means to take it slow
She' lettin' me let you go
'Cause she's been where I've been
I'm walkin' her to the door
We're standin' on the porch
We're both wantin' more
But I ain't goin' in
You might also like
I'm talkin' to a girl
I'm startin' to see
The sun still shines
And signs of life after you and me
Yeah I'm takin' it a day
At-a-time these days
'Cause I'm in a better place
No I wouldn't say I'm on top of the world

But I'm talkin' to a girl
I'm takin' a chance
I'm dancin' with a girl
And I don't dance
I'm talkin' to a girl
In the middle of the night
Hey talkin' on the phone
Can't say goodbye

I just keep talkin' to a girl
Yeah I'm startin' to see
The sun still shines
Some signs of life after you and me
Yeah I'm talkin' to a girl
I'm startin' to see
The sun still shines
And signs of life after you and me
Yeah I'm takin' it a day
At-a-time these days
'Cause I'm in a better place
No I wouldn't say I'm on top of the world
But I'm talkin' to a girl I met
Just gettin' our feet wet
We ain't callin' it nothin' yet
But I'm talkin' to a girl
Yeah I'm talkin' to a girl
