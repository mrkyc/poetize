People like me, never went to college
Except the parties I was playin' for the Sigma Kappa ladies on Friday nights
I spent a lot of weekends, with some future doctors' girlfriends
And I've learned there's people who don't like, people like me

People like me, we don't get the big promotions
Naw, 'cause we seem to lack the gene that puts the filter in between,  our brain and mouth
Oh, we don't smile and say yes, when everybody else knows it's B.S
And I've learned there's people who don't like, people like me

People like me, livin' hard, lovin' fast
Check to check, milk and gas
In the truck, head to town
A little luck, lost and found
Time to waste at Sammy's place
We all say, hey, come on in and grab a seat
Well it sure feels good to be
With people like me

People like me, we've been told we need to grow up
Well they say there's more to life than cars, pretty women and guitars, and I just say "Like what?"
Well I love God and country, I do what they ask of me
But I've learned there's people who don't like, people like me
You might also like
People like me, livin' hard, lovin' fast
Check to check, milk and gas
In the truck, head to town
A little luck, lost and found
Time to waste at Sammy's place
We all say, hey, come on in and grab a seat
Well it sure feels good to be
With people like me

People like me, crankin' up, kickin' back
Dirty joke made me laugh
Buyin' suds for my friends
All the girls that just walked in
Jukebox plays, what's your name
We all say, hey, come on in and grab a seat
Well it sure feels good to be, oh yeah
With people like me

People like me, livin' hard, lovin' fast
Check to check, milk and gas
Crankin' up, kickin' back
Dirty joke made me laugh
In the truck, head to town
A little luck, lost and found
Jukebox plays, what's your name
