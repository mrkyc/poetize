I was telling myself I was better off alone
Love was an overused word in an overplayed song
My heart was beaten up and broken on the brink
So I went to get a drink
The bartender knew that look and he knew my luck
Before I could even sit down, yeah, he was setting me up
Last thing I was looking to do was hook up
Then I looked up

And in walked you on a Saturday night
Neon blue lighting up your eyes
And the only open seat in the place was next to mine
You said, "Do you mind?"
And we talked like we were old friends
How you missed your dad, but I remind you of him
I'd have bet I was never gonna bet on love again
Then in walked you

Like a light in a hurricane, in walked you
Splash of red in a world of gray, the right two
People in the right time and place for once

We talked about hometowns, we talked about the band
And I don't even remember when I started holding your hand
It was like it was where it was always gonna be
Like learning to breathe
It was all just a blur, but I guess we closed down the bar
'Cause the next thing I knew, we were sitting in the car
Under some parking lot stars with your head on my arm
I opened my heart
You might also like
And in walked you on a Saturday night
Neon blue lighting up your eyes
And the only open seat in the place was next to mine
You said, "Do you mind?"
And we talked like we were old friends
How you missed your dad, but I remind you of him
I'd have bet I was never gonna bet on love again
Then in walked you

Like a light in a hurricane, in walked you
Splash of red in a world of gray, the right two
People in the right time and place for once

I didn't promise you tomorrow
And you didn't ask
But everything I thought about tomorrow
Changed just like that

When in walked you on a Saturday night
Neon blue lighting up your eyes
And the only open seat in the place was next to mine
You said, "Do you mind?"
And we talked like we were old friends
How you missed your dad, but I remind you of him
I'd have bet I was never gonna bet on love again
Then in walked you
Like a light in a hurricane, in walked you
Splash of red in a world of gray, the right two
People in the right time and place for once

It was the last thing I was looking to do
And I looked up
Oh, in walked you
And the only empty seat in the place was next to mine
