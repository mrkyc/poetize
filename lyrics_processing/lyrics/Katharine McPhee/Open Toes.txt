I've been needing a girl's night out
I got nothing but hand-me-down's
I need a quick fix to make these clothes hotter
No matter what it is, a girl's gotta
The pedicure, white tip french (French)
Legs don't make no sense (Sense)
Not rich, but I bought a diamond anklet
Keep it on, it goes with my outfit
Hey

Hey, let's go
If they're not too high, too low
I'll take them home
In purple, red or gold
'Cause I know them boys
They like those open toes (Toes, toes, toes, toes, toes)

Jeans all black, hair slicked back, baseball cap
Still cute in my open toes
Mini skirt, feet don't hurt, just a flirt
Too cute in my open toes
Work or play, night or day, do my thing
Too cute in my open toes
Never too many open toes
A girl needs plenty open toes

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh (Open toes)

I'm lovin' these sling-back shoes
I like the way they stay loose
I could wear 'em all day and listen to the click-clack
Shoes like this make me hate flats
Swipe that card, I'm good (Good)
Another pair in leather and wood (Wood)
I'm a sucker for a name-brand
Skip the rack and stick to the game plan

Hey, let's go
If they're not too high, too low
I'll take them home (I'll take them home)
In purple, red or gold
'Cause I know them boys (Boys)
They like (They like) those open toes (Those open toes)

Jeans all black, hair slicked back, baseball cap
Still cute in my open toes
Mini skirt, feet don't hurt, just a flirt
Too cute in my open toes
Work or play, night or day, do my thing
Too cute in my open toes
Never too many open toes
A girl needs plenty open toes
I'm feelin' down
That's when I go out
And shop 'til I drop
Everywhere that I want
'Cause nothing feels better
Than spending my treasure on me (Ah)
Finally (Ah)
I'm where I'm supposed to be (Ah, ah)

(Hey) Jeans all black, hair slicked back, baseball cap
Still cute in my open toes
Mini skirt, feet don't hurt, just a flirt
Too cute in my open toes
Work or play, night or day, do my thing
Too cute in my open toes
Never too many open toes
A girl needs plenty open toes

Put 'em on, put 'em on, let's go (Let's go)
Put 'em on, put 'em on, let's go (Let's go)
Only got one life, feeling good tonight
No, this girl's not staying home
Put 'em on, put 'em on, let's go (Let's go)
Put 'em on, put 'em on, let's go (Let's go)
Only got one life, feeling good tonight
No, this girl's not staying home (Danja)
(Hey) Jeans all black, hair slicked back, baseball cap
