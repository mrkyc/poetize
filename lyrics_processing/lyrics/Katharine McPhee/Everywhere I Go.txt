It's funny how you think you really know yourself
Like you would never lose yourself to someone else
And I was up to thinkin' it was all about you and me
Silly, silly me
I shoulda never listened to a word you said
But I was always giving in to promises
I never should have gone for, I should never long for you
No matter how hard it gets

And I want this to be over
I so want this to be through
In the end, somehow
It always comes back to you

'Cause everywhere I go
No matter what I do, boy
I just can't get you out of my head
So it annoys me
(He wasn't man enough) to come and tell me
(That I was never the one)
Like you said I was (You coulda told someone)
You knew you didn't love me anymore
You might also like
If you had only told me how you really felt
I coulda put my feelings into someone else
But I was busy thinking I was where I was supposed to be
(I was supposed to be) Silly, silly me
But there was something 'bout you that I couldn't resist
Can't put my finger on it, but whatever it is
I never shoulda stood for it (Stood for)
I know you're no good for me (Oh, oh)
And that's the way it is

And I want it to be over
I so want it to be through
In the end, somehow
It always comes back to you

'Cause everywhere I go ('Cause everywhere I go)
No matter what I do, boy (I do, boy)
I just can't get you out of my head (I want you out of my head)
So it annoys me
(He wasn't man enough) to come and tell me
(That I was never the one)
Like you said I was (You coulda told someone)
You knew that you didn't love me anymore (Oh, whoa, yeah)
I tell myself
Get over you
It's over, right? Right thing to do
And just when I thought I was done
You pull me in for another run
I can't take this, I won't take this
I can't do this, I won't do it
Even if I know, in the end, somehow
It always comes back to you (Everywhere I go)

'Cause everywhere I go (Oh, yeah)
No matter what I do, boy (No matter what I do, boy)
I just can't get you out of my head
So it annoys me
(He wasn't man enough) to come and tell me
(That I was never the one)
Like you said I was (You coulda told someone)
You knew you didn't love me anymore
Everywhere
'Cause everywhere I go (Everywhere I go)
No matter what I do, boy
(I just can't get) I just can't get you out of my head
So it annoys me
(He wasn't man enough) to come and tell me
(That I was never the one)
Like you said I was (You coulda told someone)
You knew that you didn't love me anymore
Everywhere I go, boy (Everywhere)
'Cause everywhere I go (No matter what I do, boy)
No matter what I do, boy (I just can't get you)
I just can't get you out of my head
So it annoys me (Oh, it annoys me)
(He wasn't man enough) to come and tell me (To come and tell me)
(That I was never the one)
