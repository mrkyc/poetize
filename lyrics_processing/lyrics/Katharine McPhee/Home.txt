Mmm, mmm
Yeah, yeah

You are the world within' the world that I exist
You are the touch that just won't fade
You are the end and beginning of each and every day
You are the reason I stay sane

It's hard to see beautiful
Oh, it's hard to see beautiful in your own eyes
But you make me beautiful
For the very first time

Does anybody know what it's like
To feel larger than life
To look deep in your soul
And know you're not alone?
Does anybody know how it feels
To find something that's real
And make it your own?
That's when you know that you found home
Home
You found home
Home
You might also like
And when the strings inside me
Unravel to the ground
You are the hand that gathers me up
And when I'm laughing so hard
That I can hardly breathe
How do you know just when enough's enough?

Oh, it's hard to feel beautiful
Oh, it's hard to feel beautiful in your own skin
But you make me, you make me beautiful
Over and over again

Does anybody know what it's like
To feel larger than life
To look deep in your soul
And know you're not alone?
Does anybody know how it feels
To find something that's real
And make it your own?
That's when you know that you found home
Home
You found home
Home
Don't let me down
'Cause I've waited all my life
To find, yeah

Does anybody know what it's like
To feel larger than life
To look deep in your soul
And know you're not alone?
Does anybody know how it feels
To find something that's real
And make it your own?
That's when you know that you found home
Home
You found home
That's when you know that you found home
Home
You found home
