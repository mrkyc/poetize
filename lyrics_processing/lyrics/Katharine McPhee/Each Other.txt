Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah

No more lonely nights to hurt me
No more tears left to spare
No more reasons to be unhappy
You threw 'em all up in the air

And I don't know how you did it, but you made me a believer
I never thought that love could turn someone into a dreamer
For the first time in my life, I don't feel like I need a breather
'Cause everywhere I go, I wanna know you're gonna be there

I'd give it all up for you (I'd give it all up for you)
Do anything you asked me to (Anything you asked me to)
You're like a pillow I can hold on to
'Cause we got each other, we got each other
Now that this has gone away
You left me here without a trace
And now I'm in a brand new place
'Cause we got each other
We got each other, yeah
You might also like
And some times in the past, almost pulled us under
But we got through all that and it made us stronger
Through the good, through the bad, there just ain't another
You're the best thing I have and we got each other

When the harder times confront me
You always show me that you care
And I believe you are my rescue
When I see you right there (So when I see you right there)

And I don't know how you did it, but you made me a believer (Believer)
I never thought that love could turn someone into a dreamer (Dreamer)
For the first time in my life, I don't need a breather
'Cause everywhere I go, I wanna know you're gonna be there

I'd give it all up for you (Oh)
Do anything you asked me to (Anything you asked me to)
You're like a pillow I can hold on to
'Cause we got each other (Baby), we got each other
My loneliness has gone away (My loneliness has gone away)
You left me here without a trace (You left me here without a trace)
And now I'm in a brand new place (Hey)
'Cause we got each other
We got each other, yeah
You are the hand that I reach for
When I don't wanna be alone
You are the voice I hear at night
Let's me know I'll be alright (Let's me know that I'll be alright)
When I need a real good friend
Don't have to look far, you're the best (You're the best)
I'm safe here in your arms
And I know this is where I belong

'Cause I gave it all up for you
Do anything you asked me to (Anything you asked me to)
You're like a pillow I can hold on to (Hey)
'Cause we got each other, baby, we got each other
My loneliness has gone away (It's gone away, away)
You left me here without a trace (Trace)
And now I'm in a brand new place (I'm in a brand new place)
'Cause we got each other
Baby, we got each other, yeah, yeah

No matter what happens, we got each other
Had some times in the past, but we got each other
Through the good, through the bad, we still got each other
Really happy or sad, but we got each other
I'd give it all up for you (Ooh-ooh)
Do anything you asked me to (Ooh-ooh)
You're like a pillow I can hold on to (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause we got each other, we got each other (Yeah, yeah)
My loneliness has gone away (Ooh)
You left me here without a trace (Hey)
And now I'm in a brand new place (Hey)
'Cause we got each other
Baby, we got each other, yeah

And some times in the past, almost pulled us under (Ooh-ooh)
But we got through all that and it made us stronger (Ooh-ooh)
Through the good, through the bad, there just ain't another (Ooh-ooh)
You're the best thing I have and we got each other
No matter what happens, we got each pother (Ooh-ooh)
Had some times in the past, but we got each other (Ooh-ooh)
