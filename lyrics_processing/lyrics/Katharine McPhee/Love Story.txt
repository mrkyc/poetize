I think it was the summertime
When I laid eyes on you
I didn't even know your name
Somehow we'd end up in the same room
It never crossed my mind
I never saw you like that
I should've listened to my best friend
She knew we'd be a perfect match

It's a typical love story
We started out as friends
We met way back when
This is just a typical love story
The boy you never wanted just steals your heart
I never saw it comin' 'til I fell so hard
You might also like

Ooh-ooh, oh

I always made up some excuse
Saying that you weren't my type (Ah-ooh)
Didn't wanna face the truth
Didn't wanna cross that line
'Til one day I saw you, out the corner of my eye
You were flirting with some girl
And inside, I thought I would die

It's a typical (Hey) love story
We started out as friends (Friends)
We met way back when (When)
This is just a typical love story
The boy you never wanted just steals your heart
I never saw it comin' 'til I fell so hard

Can't believe it's happening
When I least expect it
My prince under disguise
How you fooled me with those eyes
When I feel like letting go
In your arms is where I know
I am wrong
From the beginning, we always belong
Love, love story, love (Ooh)
Love story, love (Love)
Love story, love (Love story)
Love story, love (This is my)
Love story, love (This is my love story)
Love story, love
Love story, love
This is my love story

It's a typical love story
We started out as friends (Friends)
This is how it ends
This is just a typical love story
The boy you never wanted just steals your heart
I never saw it comin' 'til I fell so hard
It's a typical love story
We started out as friends (Friends)
This is how it ends
This is just a typical love story
The boy you never wanted just steals your heart
I never saw it comin' 'til I fell so hard
