We spent too many times that I have laid alone
Wondering where you are, why you're not home
I'm in and out of feelings that won't let me be
I never thought this love would fail for me
I won't ask you to make it better
I'll be strong and say it's all over

It takes a lot of love just to let it go
It takes a lot of love just to let you know
That you will have a part of me that's holding on to all that we had
Takes a lot of love just to say we are friends
It takes a lot of love to bring it to an end
There's nothing else to say that matters
It's breaking me apart
I know you love her

If I had the answers, I would shout them out
Tell everyone what love is all about
But all that I have learned is you just give yourself
To love in life and hope it treats you well
It hurts so much when I see you cryin'
I'll be brave, but inside, I'm dying
You might also like
It takes a lot of love just to let it go
It takes a lot of love just to let you know
That you will have a part of me that's holding on to all that we had
Takes a lot of love just to say we're friends
It takes a lot of love to bring it to an end
There's nothing else to say that matters
It's breaking me apart

Just walk away
Don't look back
Live your life
Don't be sad
Think of me
When you can
Just believe that I'm strong enough to keep back up
And I'll find love again
Something good that never ends, another soul, another friend
Someone who wants to be there for me, won't ever leave

It takes a lot of love just to let it go
It takes a lot of love just to let you know
That you will have a part of me that's holding on to all that we had
Takes a lot of love just to say we're friends
It takes a lot of love to bring it to an end
There's nothing else to say that matters
It's breaking me apart
It takes a lot of love just to let it go
It takes a lot of love just to let you know
That you will have a part of me that's holding on to all that we had
Takes a lot of love just to say we're friends
It takes a lot of love to bring it to an end
There's nothing else to say that matters
It's breaking me apart
I know you love her
