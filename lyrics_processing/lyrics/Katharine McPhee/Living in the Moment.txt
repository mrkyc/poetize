So this is how my life turns out
Lost in chapter three
Empty vases, spanx and no thanks
Book clubs and TV
And no one noticed
Mmm, least of all me
No more high heeled shoes or low cut jeans
Lipstick or perfume
No midnight calls or secret glances
Hold up in my room
And no one noticed
Least of all me

There's no down and out
As long as you keep trying
You'll be right back in the game
But you've changed

Now I'm living in the moment
And I'm excited to be turning the page again
If you read between the lines
You'll know it's my time
And I can see the signs
It's not over till it's over
You might also like
I surround myself with people
Who can feel my heart and soul
I discover friends and lovers
Then your dreams make me whole
I finally noticed, oh
Oh, love will pull me in

What a joy to find that life can still surprise me
But I won't be compromised
I realize

Now I'm living in the moment
And I'm excited to be turning the page again
If you read between the lines
You'll know it's my time
And I can see the signs
It's not over till it's over
Ooh, ooh

Now, I'm grateful for the lessons of this journey
They have made me who I am (who I am)
I understand
Now I'm living in the moment
And I'm excited to be turning the page again
If you read between the lines
You'll know it's my time
And I can see the signs
It's not over till it's over
Ooh, ooh

And now I know this is my moment
And I'm going to be riding some brand new life
'Cause I know this is my time
And I've been redinfined
Watch me as I shine
It's not over till over

(Living in the moment, let the pages turn)
(Living in the moment) Oh-oh
I made my own story
(Living in the moment, let the pages turn)
(Living in the moment)
This feeling goes on and on and on and on and on
(Living in the moment, let the pages turn)
(Living in the moment)
(Living in the moment, let the pages turn) Yeah
