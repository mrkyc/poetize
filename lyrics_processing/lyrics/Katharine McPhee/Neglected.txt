If these walls could talk, baby, what would they say?
They've been a witness to all of the pain
I gave you everything I had to give
Now I'm so empty 'cause you had your fill
You took the light from my face

The more you try to tell me that you've changed
The more I feel neglected
If this is how you try to make it up to me
Then let's just end it
I don't like this feeling anymore
I don't like this feeling
'Cause whenever I'm around you, boy
I know that I won't be respected
Just neglected

Woo, hoo, hoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Woo, hoo, hoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Neglected)
You might also like
All that I wanted was you by my side
But you walked in front of me all of the while (All of the while)
Nothing I ever did was good enough
Well, thank you, baby, 'cause you made me tough
Now I can go on my way (On my way)

The more you try to tell me that you've changed
The more I feel neglected
If this is how you try to make it up to me
Then let's just end it
I don't like this feeling anymore
I don't like this feeling
'Cause whenever I'm around you, boy
I know that I won't be respected
Just neglected

Woo, hoo, hoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Woo, hoo, hoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Neglected)
Whoa

I never saw it coming (Coming)
I shoulda kept on running (Running)
But instead I was there by your side
Believing in all of your lies
How could you neglect me, straight up disrespect me
(How could you?) How could you neglect my love?
(How could you neglect my love?)
How could you neglect me, straight up disrespect me
How could you neglect my love? (How could you neglect my love?)
The more you try to tell me that you've changed
(The more you try and change)
The more you try and change, the more I feel neglected
If this is how you try to make it up to me
Then let's just end it (We need to just end it)
I don't like this feeling anymore
I don't like this feeling
'Cause whenever I'm around you, boy
I know that I won't be respected
Just neglected

How could you neglect me (Woo)
Straight up disrespect me (Hoo, hoo)
How could you neglect my love? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
How could you neglect me (Woo)
Straight up disrespect me (Hoo, hoo)
How could you neglect my love? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(How could you?) How could you neglect me (Woo)
Straight up disrespect me (Hoo, hoo, you)
How could you neglect my love? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(How could you? Oh yeah)
How could you neglect me (Woo)
Straight up disrespect me (Hoo, hoo)
How could you neglect my love? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
