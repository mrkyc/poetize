I'm over your lies
And I'm over your games
I'm over you asking me when you know I'm not okay
You call me at night
And I pick up the phone
And though you'll be telling me
I know you're not alone

Oh, and that's why
(Your eyes) I'm over it
(Your smile) I'm over it
(Realized) I'm over it, I'm over it
I'm over

Wanting you to be wanting me
No, that ain't no way to be
How I feel, read my lips
Because I'm so over (I'm so)
Moving on and it's my time
You never were a friend of mine
Hurt at first a little bit, but now I'm so over
I'm so over it
You might also like
I'm over your hands
And I'm over your mouth
Trying to drag me down
And fill me with self doubt

Oh, and that's why your world
I'm over it (So sure)
I'm over it (I'm not your girl)
I'm over it, I'm over it
I'm over

Wanting you to be wanting me
No, that ain't no way to be
How I feel, read my lips
Because I'm so over (I'm so)
Moving on and it's my time
You never were a friend of mine
Hurt at first a little bit, but now I'm so over
So over it
I'm so over it

Oh
Don't call, don't come by
Ain't no use, don't ask me why
You'll never change
There'll be no more crying in the rain
Oh, oh-oh
I'm over it

Wanting you to be wanting me
No, that ain't no way to be
How I feel, read my lips
Because I'm so over (I'm so)
Moving on and it's my time
You never were a friend of mine
Hurt at first a little bit, but now I'm so over
So over it
I'm so over it
I'm over it

Wanting you to be wanting me
No, that ain't no way to be
How I feel, read my lips
Because I'm so over (I'm so)
Moving on and it's my time
You never were a friend of mine
Hurt at first a little bit, but now I'm so over
So over it
