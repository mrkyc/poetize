From the first time I saw you
Well, I thought that we'd be cool
But I overestimated us, boy (You boy, you boy)
'Cause we started out as friends (Friends)
And I thought that'd never end
Even when we turned into more

Have we moved into the fast lane? (Fast lane)
Oh, we just collided in the fast lane (Fast lane)
Even though we tried it, we got no place (Even though we tried it, we ain't goin' no places)
And there's no going back for us now, no way (Ah, ah)
I think it's time we set things straight, 'cause

I'm not your girl (No, I'm not your girl)
Don't get confused because you see me lookin' at you
No, baby, I'm not your girl (No, I'm not your girl)
And I'm not leaving with you just because you ask me to
No, no

I know you want me, but it's just too late
Don't try and stop me or get in my way
You might also like
Don't you look at me like that
It don't matter how you act
You and me are now in the past
And when I see you walkin' by
Don't be surprised if I say "Hi"
But it won't be anymore than just that

Not moving down the fast lane (Fast lane)
Oh, we just collided in the fast lane (Fast lane)
Even though we tried it, we got no place (Even though we tried it, we ain't goin' no places)
And there's no going back for us now, no way (Ah, ah)
I think it's time we set things straight, 'cause

I'm not your girl (No, I'm not your girl)
Don't get confused because you see me lookin' at you
No, baby, I'm not your girl (No, I'm not your girl)
And I'm not leaving with you just because you ask me to
No, no

I know you want me, but it's just too late
Don't try and stop me or get in my way
I know you want me, but it's just too late
Don't try and stop me or get in my way
You should have thought about the way that you treated me
You should have thought about the things that you said to me
I shoulda walked away the first time I saw your face
Got so distracted, nearly lost it in the fast lane

I'm not your girl (No, I'm not your girl, I'm not your girl)
Don't get confused because you see me lookin' at you (Because you see me lookin' at you, at you, oh)
No, baby, I'm not your girl (No, I'm not your girl, I'm, oh)
And I'm not leaving with you just because you ask me to
No, no (Oh)

I know you want me, but it's just too late (Just too late for us)
Don't try and stop me or get in my way (Get in my way)
I know you want me, but it's just too late (Ooh, just too late)
Don't try and stop me or get in my way (Don't you try and get in my way)

Mmm, yeah
Mmm, yeah
