Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh

Girl, I remember how it all began
You introduced her as your friend
But I knew I was in trouble when
I saw her smile at me
And then she asked me for a dance
But never offered you a glance
Well, let me tell you girl
With friends like that ,who needs enemies?

Shoulda known better then to trust a friend
Who's jealous of the way we're livin'
I don't think you know what's happening
Your girl is shading you
Oh
Shoulda known better then to trust a friend
Behind your back, she gives me rhythm
But I'm about to make her understand
I only dance with you

Girl, you say your friends just flirting
But it's getting so ridiculous
That she thinks that she can mess with us
But I don't play around
Even if she's saying that you're well aware
And it's cool with you to share
No, I still ain't gonna dance with her
I'm telling you right now
You might also like
Shoulda known better then to trust a friend
Who's jealous of the way we're livin'
I don't think you know what's happening
Your girl is shading you
Oh
Shoulda known better then to trust a friend
Behind your back, she gives me rhythm
But I'm about to make her understand
I only dance with you

Don't try to say I lost my mind
I know your girl has crossed the line ('Cause I really know that)
She's got issues, she trying to diss you
The minute that she turned around, she pulled a switch move
Coz she's wishing what's yours was hers
So now listen girl, that ain't never gonna work

Shoulda known better then to trust a friend
Who's jealous of the way we're livin'
I don't think you know what's happening
Your girl is shading you (Your girl is shading you)
Oh
Shoulda known better then to trust a friend
Behind your back, she gives me rhythm
But I'm about to make her understand
I only dance with you
Shoulda known better then to trust a friend
Who's jealous of the way we're livin'
I don't think you know what's happening
Your girl is shading you
Oh
Shoulda known better then to trust a friend
Behind your back, she gives me rhythm
But I'm about to make her understand
I only dance with you
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I only dance with you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I only dance with you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
