Hey, yea, oh
Well it's been four lonely days
And Three lonely nights
Looking for my baby
But she's nowhere in sight
You see I've traveled far and wide
I've seen the finest places
What does it all amount to
When there's no familiar faces?
You see I've been around the world and I
I can't find my lover
Been around the world And I
I don't know where she can be
Been around the world And I
I can't find my lover
Been around the world And I
I can't even find myself
Hey yea oh
Well I don't know where I am
And I don't know who I'm with
All I'm hanging on to
Is that good loving that you give
You see I've lost my sense of time
And I got no direction
Sending out a signal
To try an to get your attention

I'm not the only one who's feeling down and out
Noises faces
That covered up my mind
