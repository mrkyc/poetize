Shy, shy girl
Shy Girl
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh (oh, oh)

Standing with the wallflowers
Wishing you've stayed at home
You kick yourself for coming
When you're standing there all alone
The centers of attention are busy making all their moves
Oh Girl...
While all the guys are lookin' at them
I got my eye on you
Only you

You might think you're nothing special
You might be losing hope
But baby don't you realize
How beautiful you really are?

Shy girl
It's written on your face
A mermaid out of water
Feeling out of place
Shy girl
Tryin' to hide a blush
Caught you looking for a second
Felt my heart a-rush
Don't run away
Don't be afraid
Don't be shy girl
So beautiful (so beautiful)
Shy shy girl
You might also like
I'm moving in closer
Slowly tryin' to break the ice
Shy shy girl
But it's hard to get a look on your downward glancing eyes
Oh yeah

You might think you're nothing special
But I'm about to lose my hope (About to lose my hope)
Oh baby don't you realize
How beautiful you really are?

Shy girl
It's written on your face
A mermaid out of water
Feeling out of place
Shy girl
Tryin' to hide a blush
Caught you looking for a second
Felt my heart a-rush
Don't run away
Don't be afraid
Don't be shy girl
Now I'm standing right in front of you
I confess I'm nervous too
Girl you know there's something goin' on
And not to give it a chance
Would be so wrong (Be so wrong)
Oh baby

Shy girl
It's written on your face
A mermaid out of water
Feeling out of place
Shy girl
Tryin' to hide a blush
Pretending that there's nothing between the two of us
Don't run away
Don't be afraid
Don't be shy girl
It's written on your face
A mermaid out of water
Feeling out of place
Shy girl
Tryin' to hide a blush
Pretending that there's nothing between the two of us
Don't run away
Don't be afraid
Don't be shy girl
Hey girl
Don't be shy girl
(Hahaha) Shy shy girl
Don't run away
Oh baby
Lookin' at you
Come a little closer
Shy, Shy girl
Shy girl
You make my heart beat so badly
Shy girl
