If I were a painter, mixing my colors
How could I ever find, the blue of your eyes?
The canvas could never, capture the light of your smile
Of your smile

And girl, if I were a sculptor, working in marble
I couldn't hope, to copy your perfect face
The curve of your body, the feel of your skin
My hands could never, ever trace

So I'll try and find a melody as beautiful as you
Find the words to say your eyes are bluer than blue
Fill my voice with the emotion I'm feeling for you
And now, when the beat is so strong
I'll give my heart in a song

Oh girl
If I were an actor, I could be someone
Someone who'd always know, the right things to say
But as soon as I'd see you, I'd forget all my lines
And you'd never know, what I feel inside
You might also like
So I'll try and find a melody as beautiful as you
Find the words to say your eyes are bluer than blue
Fill my voice with the emotion I'm feeling for you
And now, when the beat is so strong
I'll give my heart in a song

There's no other way (No other way)
That I know to say (I know to say)
Baby, how much I love you
And if you'll only give me a chance
Oh girl

So I'll try and find a melody as beautiful as you
Find the words to say your eyes are bluer than blue
Fill my voice with the emotion I'm feeling for you
And now, when the beat is so strong
I'll give my heart in a song
So I'll try and find a melody as beautiful as you
Find the words to say your eyes are bluer than blue
Fill my voice with the emotion I'm feeling for you
And now, when the beat is so strong
I'll give my heart in a song
I'll do, I'll do what I do
You know why, why?
Your eyes are bluer than blue
Uh huh, yeah
I said I'll do what I do
I'll give my heart in a song
You know I'm not a painter, actor, baby
It don't matter
I'll do, I'll do what I do
You know why, why?
Your eyes are bluer than blue
Uh huh, yeah
I'll give my heart in a song
I'll do, I'll do what I do
You know why, why?
Your eyes are bluer than blue
Oh, you're so beautiful
