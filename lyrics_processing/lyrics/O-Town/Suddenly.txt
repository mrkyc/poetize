She Said We Gave It Our All
As She Walked Away
I Never Saw A Girl's Eyes So Blue
No, Tell Me Is There Something I Can Do?
Leave Another Message On The Telephone
And You're Parked Outside With Your Headlights On
-CHORUS 1-
Suddenly I'm Standing At Your Door
And The Steps Don't Feel Like They Did Before
The Radio's Playing Loud But It's Not Our Song
Suddenly He's All Alone With You
He's Looking In Your Eyes Like I Wanted To
I Knock Four Times And Pretend You're Not At Home
Suddenly I'm All Alone
Suddenly I'm All Alone
She Said It Wasn't The Same
She Said our Life's Been So Plain
Then She Walked Away
I Wanna Make Things Brand New
Tell Me Is There Something I Can Do?
Leave Another Message On The Telephone
And You're Parked Outside With Your Headlights On
