Lying here on the couch
With my heart in my mouth
I realize you were right
I was wrong and
I'm in pieces and bits
But that's nothing you can't fix
Cause baby you still my addiction
Oh every minute's like a thousand years
Since you were lying here
In the middle of the night
I turn on the light
Too desperate to breathe
Cause I get this craving
There's no time to waste
Gotta get a taste
Satisfy my needs
Baby, won't you save me?
Got this craving for you, for you
Yeayea
It's like you live in these walls
I hear your voice down the hall
I swear I see your face it's everywhere, its every place
I starve myself past the pain
But still it won't go away
The more I try to forget, I remember
You might also likeOh every minute's like a thousand years
Since you were lying here
In the middle of the night
I turn on the light
Too desperate to breathe
Cause I get this craving
There's no time to waste
Gotta get a taste
Satisfy my needs
Baby, won't you save me?
Got this craving to lose myself in you
When we're standing in the rain
To keeping you awake through the night
I hunger for your touch
Cause I need you back
What's wrong with that?
No I can't be without you no more
In the middle of the night
I turn on the light
To desperate to breathe
Cause I get this craving
There's no time to waste
Gotta get a taste
Satisfy my needs
Baby, won't you save me?
In the middle of the night
I turn on the light
To desperate to breathe
Cause I get this craving
There's no time to waste
Gotta get a taste
Satisfy my needs
Baby, won't you save me?
