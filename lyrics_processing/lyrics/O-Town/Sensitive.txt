Sensitive
Who says a man's not supposed to be?
Sensitive (I'm sensitive)
I'm keeping the faith that you still love me
Oooh

Girl I know that something's wrong
Something strange is going on
And no matter what I do
It's like a wall I can't break through
Girl I need to understand
But you won't give me answers
How can I help you
If you don't want me to?

I never hear you laugh
I never see you cry
Never heard you say you need a love like mine
See I've giving you everything that's inside
But you need to fill me up
'Cause you're not playing with the flame
Girl you won't get burned
You know that's not the kind of thing I do
I guess I need to get what I give
What can I say
Girl I'm sensitive

Ain't nobody out to control
You are what you stand for
Baby girl I really need to know
Do or don't you want this love
Won't you help me understand?
Girl I really need some answers
How can I help you
If you don't want me to?

I never hear you laugh
I never see you cry
Never heard you say you need a love like mine
See I've giving you everything that's inside
But you need to fill me up
'Cause you're not playing with the flame
Girl you won't get burned
You know that's not the kind of thing I do
I guess I need to get what I give
What can I say
Girl I'm sensitive
