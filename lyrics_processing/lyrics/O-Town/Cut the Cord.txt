Told everyone that it was a star
I convinced myself that nothing was wrong
But it's gone too far
Can't find a point in holding on
To pieces that are falling apart
If there's one thing worse than wasted time
It's a wasted heart
I don't know
I don't know what we're fighting for
And I don't wanna fight no more
And you don't wanna fight for me, for me, for me
So what took us so long
To get to right here
To get to right now
We gotta move on
It's better for everyone
So come on
So let's just cut the cord, cut the cord, cut the cord
And we don't need each other anymore, anymore
So let's just cut the cord, cut the cord, cut the cord
And we don't need each other, we don't need each other

Then send me a bill for the straw
Don't you have enough, you took so much
You gotta take the loss
Let's just go our separate ways
Like opposite lights in the cross
So we don't make the same mistake
Just rip the bandaid off
I don't know
I don't know what we're fighting for
And I don't wanna fight no more
And you don't wanna fight for me
So what took us so long
To get to right here
To get to right now
We gotta move on
It's better for everyone
So come on
So let's just cut the cord, cut the cord, cut the cord
And we don't need each other anymore, anymore
So let's just cut the cord, cut the cord, cut the cord
And we don't need each other, we don't need each other
So what took us so long
To get to right here
To get to right now
We gotta move on
It's better for everyone
So come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
It took too long
We gotta move on
