Would I walk through fire
Just to be with you, to be with you, yeah
Would I cross an ocean
Just to hold you, yeah
Would I give up all I have
To see you smile, to see you smile
Would I walk through hell
And not think twice

Baby I would, baby I will
Baby I'll do that gladly
Be all you need, do anything
To make you happy
Baby I could, baby I can
Do anything you ask me
Baby I can, baby I could
Baby I would, I would

Would I be the harbor always there for you
Right there for you, baby
Would I be the shelter that would shield you, yeah
Would I be the loving light to light your way
To light your way honey
And would I defend you with my life
Life

Baby I could, baby I can
Do anything you ask me

I'll keep you from the cold
I'll be there to hold you
And if tears should find your eyes, your eyes
I would be the one to dry them, be the one to dry them
I would risk it all and give it all to you
Baby I...

Baby I would, I would
