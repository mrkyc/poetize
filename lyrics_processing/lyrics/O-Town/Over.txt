I've been sleeping on the floor, I got nowhere to go
The shoulder was colder than cold, you just let me go
You just let me go, go, go
I'm a glutton for punishment though, coming back for more
So tell me how did you get so over me, so over me, so fast
Tell me how the hell you over me, so over me, like that
Say you never loved me, i'll tear up the memories
Forget that you met me, I don't know what else I could do
Tell me how the hell you over me, and I'll get over you
I'm so tangled up in you, in so many ways
That every time I try to move, I'm frozen in place
What you did was lower than low,  I can't let it go
I can't let it go, go go
I'm a glutton for punishment though, coming back for more
So tell me how did you get so over me, so over me, so fast
Tell me how the hell you over me, so over me, like that
Say you never loved me, i'll tear up the memories
Forget that you met me, I don't know what else I could do
Tell me how the hell you over me, and I'll get over you
Oooooo
Just say that there was nothing there, that you take it back
Ooooooo
I really shouldn't have to ask, don't you owe me that
Ooooooo
Be honest as we fade to black, noooo
