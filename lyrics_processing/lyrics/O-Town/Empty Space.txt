Like a spiral staircase
All the way to the floor
I won't let you leave
Even if it means
I'll stand in front of the door
Cause there's a black hole in my heart
If I ain't with you (I ain't with you)
Every shape, every trace, or the curves around your body
I don't know what I should do, cause I ain't myself if I ain't with you
And I can't get you up out of my head
No I can't get you up out of my heart
And I can't get you up out of my bed
Cause once you leave, they'll only be
Empty space x3
Cause once you leave they'll only be
Empty Space
I've never felt this pain, it ain't Novocaine
It can own my heart now
I can't fill up the void
I swear I hear your voice
And you know where to be found
You might also likeCause there's a black hole in my heart
If I ain't with you
Every shape, every trace, or the curves around your body
I don't know what I should do (Don't know what I should do)
Cause I ain't myself if I ain't with you
And I can't get you up out of my head
No I can't get you up out of my heart
And I can't get you up out of my bed
Cause once you leave, they'll only be
Empty space x3
Cause once you leave they'll only be
Empty Space
Cause once you leave they'll only be
Hey no empty space is no respecting
But this emptiness is depressing
You ain't gotta ask no questions
I'm full, 1K, invest it
You can grab my black book
Throw it out, look through my phone
Just trust
Help me fill your cups
And you know what's up
But if you leave there's only just
Empty space x3 (ad libs)
Cause once you leave they'll only be
Empty Space x4 (ad libs)
Cause once you leave they'll only be
