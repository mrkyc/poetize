Ooh ooh ooh oh yeah
When I see ya (see ya see ya)
Can't believe ya ('lieve ya 'lieve ya)
Did you slip on heaven's floor
A fallen angel
I've been around the world
But I've never seen a girl
Who makes my nature rise the way that you do
Like Haagen Dazs you hit the spot
You make me scream
'Cause you got a lot
In your Calvin jeans you're a beauty queen
And you're blowin' my mind

Just one look was all it took
I'm shook 'cause no one else compares to you

You're crazy sexy
Got a body like a dancer on MTV
I'd spend all my ends
To hold you close to me
You're the sexiest woman alive (sexy, sexy, sexy)
Oh babe it's so insane
And you work that body like you're on Soul Train
You got the stuff that'd
Make a guy do most anything
The sexiest woman alive (sexy, sexy, sexy)
You might also like
When you walk into a room
The first reaction's oohhh
Every guy round just wants to sweat ya
But I bet a million, boo
They don't feel you like I do
'Cause I'm about to make you my wifey
My wifey
Like Haagen Dazs you hit the spot
Girl you know you got a lot
In your In your Calvin jeans you're a beauty queen
And you 're blowin' my mind

Just one look was all it took I'm shook 'cause
No one else compares to you yeah

The sexiest woman alive (Sexy, sexy, sexy)
Though I've been around the world
I never had a girl like you
Wanna make my dreams come true
Been to Africa
Had sushi in Japan
Use to think I was the man (Yeah)
Though I tasted all the finer things
I never had a dime like you
I like (I like) the way that we touch in the night
Girl your love just knocks me out
