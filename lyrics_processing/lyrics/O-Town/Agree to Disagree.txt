We make a mess so we can clean it up, all night
I wanna see it in your eyes, eyes
That we won't be stopping 'til we see that sunlight
Ya we both know we'll never walk away
It's like a rocket in my heart when you say my name
You're the only one who knows my buttons babe
Light up my buttons and make that body say
I got the match if you got the gasoline
You got a temper like something I've never seen baby
I've seen some shit you can't print in a magazine
We keep it hot and make a scene
Agree to disagree, ah babe
Agree to disagree, no way
We keep it hot and make a scene oh baby
Agree to disagree, oh babe
I love it when your mad, mad
When you're on fire, its the best I've ever had baby
Turn up the heat, let's lose control
No point in fighting it when we both know
Well it may be easier to walk away, walk away
But.i know it hits you like a spark when I say your name
I'm the only one who knows your buttons babe
Light up your buttons and make that body say
You might also likeI got the match if you got the gasoline
You got a temper like something I've never seen baby
I've seen some shit you can't print in a magazine
We keep it hot and make a scene
Agree to disagree, ah babe
Agree to disagree, no way
We keep it hot and make a scene oh baby
Agree to disagree, oh babe
Agree to disagree, oh babe
Agree to disagree, no way
We keep it hot and make a scene oh baby
Agree to disagree, oh babe
Agree to disagree, no way
We keep it hot and make a scene oh baby
Agree to disagree, oh babe
Agree to disagree, no way
We keep it hot and make a scene oh baby
