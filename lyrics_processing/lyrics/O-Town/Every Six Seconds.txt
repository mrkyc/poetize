Every six seconds
Every six seconds

Baby I can't stop
My mind from slipping
Every Six seconds or less
Preoccupation with the opposite sex
And you're the one I blame
For making me go missing
I think of you in different ways
Fourteen thousand times a day

Victoria's Secret I've been keeping
And its getting harder all the time
I can't keep it undercover
I need your soft lips kissing mine

Every six seconds
My body start begging
Your sweet thing is wreckin' me
Untill you give me some
Ten times a minute
Six hundred times an hour
Another cold shower
Until you give me some (until you give me some)
You might also like
I picture you
In red Mac lipstick
Smudgin' all over me
Leavin' a mark on my fantasy
Or swimming in water
Wearing nothing but moonlight
Both of us soaking wet
Splash
Halfway to the towel
That's as far as we get

Victoria's Secret I've been keeping
And its getting harder all the time
I can keep it undercover
I need your soft lips kissing mine

Every six seconds
My body start begging
Your sweet thing is wrecking me
Until you give me some
Ten times a minute
Six hundred times an hour
Another cold shower
Until you give me some
Every six seconds
My body start begging
Your sweet thing is messing me
Until you give me some
Ten times a minute
Six hundred times an hour
Girl, you've got the power
Until you give me some
Thoughts of you keeps swimming through my brain
Baby night and day and I
Cannot concentrate on anything
But this urge I have inside
Every six seconds
Every six seconds
Until you give me some
Every six seconds
Every six seconds
Until you give me some
Every six seconds
My body start begging
Your sweet thing is wreckin' me
Untill you give me some
Ten times a minute
Six hundred times an hour
Another cold shower
Until you give me some
Every six seconds
My body start begging
Your sweet thing is wreckin' me
Untill you give me some
Ten times a minute
Six hundred times an hour
Another cold shower
Until you give me some
