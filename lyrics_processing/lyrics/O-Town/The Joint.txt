(DJ can you play it as a favour for me?)
*scratch*
DJ can you play it as a favour for me
You know the joint that the shortys keep talkin about
DJ can you play it as a favour for me
You know the joint that makes 'em get down, get down
Take off more rec-
More rec-
More records off the shelf
'Cause I ain't dancin' by myself
And you're the only one who can help
Uh huh
Saw this honey come through the back door
And I need to get her out on the floor
So can I buy me a beat
By breakin you off a drink
'Cause you know what I came here for..
Chorus
DJ can you play it as a favour for me
You know the joint that the shorties keep talkin about
DJ can you play it as a favour for me
You know the joint that makes 'em get down, get down
DJ can you play it as a favour for me
You know the joint that the shorties keep talkin about
DJ can you play it as a favour for me
You know the joint that makes 'em get down, get down
You might also likeI love
Rockin, rockin
Hip hop with rock n roll
Mix it with a lil rhythm and soul
And you know that we'll be good to go
Uh huh
I think it's time for the place to get hot
So DJ make the beat drop
You better raise up your glass
And start shakin yo (ahh)
'Cause the party ain't about to stop
(chorus)
I'ma put another dime up in the jukebox
Let the music play all night long
Giving you a taste of southern comfort
Wraped up in a love song
Record man can we do it again?
Press rewind before the joint ends
'Cause I'm about to pull her outta her seat
And I'm hopin' she can stand the heat
Ohhhhh
Burnin up, burnin up
The dance floor's burnin up
Burnin up, burnin up
The joint's like burnin up
Burnin up, burnin up
The dance floor's burnin up
Burnin up, burnin up
The joint's like burnin up
