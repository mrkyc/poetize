This time
I'm done with always screwing up
I'm sick of one direction down
I'm a broken picture frame
My whole world twisted inside out
Screaming voices like a hurricane
Telling me to wake up, get out of bed
Put your feet on the floor
There's fresh air out the door

And I've been acting so pathetic
Knocking around like a ball of string
It's taking time for me to get it
I'm ready and willing to do anything
To make it up to you

My arms are hurting so bad from being so empty
My heart weighs like a ton 'cause it feels so heavy
I'm standing here all alone, wishing that I could've known
You just can't walk away from the damage

Last time
I'm playing with a broken string
It don't matter, no one's listening
'Cause losing you has made me see
I've gotta change, gotta blame it all on me
You might also like
And I've been acting so pathetic
Knocking around like a ball of string
It's taking time for me to get it
I'm ready and willing to do anything
To make it up to you

My arms are hurting so bad from being so empty (So empty)
My heart weighs like a ton 'cause it feels so heavy (Yeah)
I'm standing here all alone, wishing that I could've known
You just can't walk away from the damage (Damage)

My eyes may as well be blind if I just can't see you
(If I just can't see you)
My hands may as well be tied 'cause I just can't touch you
(Touch you)

Before the smoke can really clear away
From fires I started yesterday
I know I've gotta find a way
Somehow I've gotta find a way to wake up
From the damage
My arms are hurting so bad from being so empty (So empty)
My heart weighs like a ton 'cause it feels so heavy
I'm standing here all alone, wishing that I could've known
You just can't walk away from the damage (Damage)

My eyes may as well be blind if I just can't see you
(If I just can't see you)
My hands may as well be tied 'cause I just can't touch you
(Touch you)

I'm standing here all alone
Wishing that I could've known
You just can't walk away from the damage

I'm standing here all alone
Wishing that I could've known
