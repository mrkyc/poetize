O-Town, I want you to close your eyes and fall into a deep trance
And when I count to 3
You will wake up and will be mine
Oooh...
I like it, like it, like it, like it, like it (ah ah ah , ah ah ah yeah ah ah ah)
I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you (ah ah ah , ah ah ah yeah ah ah ah)
I know you, know you, know you, know you, know you (ah ah ah , ah ah ah yeah ah ah ah)
I love you when you take me down, down under your spell

My mind is suffocated
By your deep sigh
The scent of you has got me
So blind, why, why can't I be with you
Full time 'cause
You bring me under
Your lips, your eyes, your skin
Can't wait to be within
Your thoughts, your mind
We'll meet in time babe
You're mine babe
So fine babe
But for now
You might also like
I like it when you bring me under
Girl, I know you so well
I love you when we get down, down
Oh, can't you tell
I know you know when I first met you, baby
My heart fell
I love it when you take me down, down
Under Your spell

Can I get an "O"
Can I get a "T"
Can I get an "O"
And a "W"
And an "N" (ah)
Bring it back

If you, could ever understand
What you put me through
Then I, I
I could forgive you
I can't forget you
The things that you do
Won't leave my mind, too
I came to you with a broken view of what
My life should be
You carried me so consciously
I send my mind through your eyes
My thoughts are caught up in you
Who can't wait to wrap myself in you

I like it when you bring me under
Girl, I know you so well
I love you when we get down, down
Baby, can't you tell
I know you know when I first met you, baby
My heart fell
I love it when you take me down, down, down, down
Under your spell
1, 2, 3...

When I look into your eyes
My mind just don't know what to do and
It's a crazy thing
Got me all in trance
Wanna dance in the streets with you and
You got it goin' on, flowin' on
Girl you never show me wrong
Make a brotha wanna go write a song
And give you all my publishin'
Wanna gonna go where you wanna go
Run wild, have fun at the carnival, cause
I think I'm in love with you
And before I never knew that I was so
I can't recall
Not at all
The last time a girl made me fall
So deep that I had withdrawals
So don't stop cause
I like it when you bring me under
I know you so well
I love you when we get down, down
Oooh Can't you tell
I know you know when I first met you baby
My heart fell
I love it when you take me down, down
Under your spell

I like it when you bring me under
I love you when we get down, down
Can't you tell me baby
I know you know when I first met you baby
I love it when you take me down, down
