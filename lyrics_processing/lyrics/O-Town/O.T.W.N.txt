Without an assurance you'd ever come through
I can't help but feel how I do, but I do
I would steal all the stars from the night
But they don't compare to the spark in your eye
There's no doubt about it I tried, yeah I tried
You can't keep me away with a thousand foot steel barricade
There's nothing you do that can keep me from you, ain't no way
Cause I know where you are
Don't matter how far you go
I'll find a way to get there today no matter what
And you don't have to call
Matter of fact I was there before you thought about calling
I'm on the way now, I'm on the way now
I'm on the way now, (On the way, on the way)
I'm on the way now, (On the way, on the way)
If I could clear all the clouds out of the sky
I'd light that thing up like the Fourth of July
If all else fails follow your guide
I'm right by your side
You can't keep me away with a thousand foot steel barricade
There's nothing you do that can keep me from you, ain't no way
You might also likeCause I know where you are
Don't matter how far you go
I'll find a way to get there today no matter what
And you don't have to call
Matter of fact I was there before you thought about calling
I'm on the way now, I'm on the way now
I'm on the way now
Never gonna let, never let you down (no)
I'm on the way now
Never gonna let never, let you down (no)
Cause I know where you are
Don't matter how far you go
I'll find a way to get there today no matter what
And you don't have to call
Matter of fact I was there before you thought about calling
I'm on the way now, I'm on the way now
