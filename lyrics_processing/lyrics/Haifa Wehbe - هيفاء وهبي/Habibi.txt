You've become, my method and it won't stop
Don't you dare, keep it going baby don't stop
Cuz i know what i know and i know what i don't
And no one can convince me otherwise
I see the beat of my heart speeds up in tempo
Everytime that you look me in the eyes
You're everything i want

What i want, What i need; What you want?

You're in love, Yeah
I got you high on the feelin', Huh
Cuz i know what i want and i know What i got
And no one can stop me tonight
Cuz once it starts you'll never let me go
Cuz only i can do it right
I'm everything you want
