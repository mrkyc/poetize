When superstars and cannonballs are running through your head
A television freak show, cops and robbers everywhere

Subway makes me nervous, people pushing me too far
I've got to break away, so take my hand now

'Cause I want to live, like animals
Careless and free, like animals
I want to live, I want to run through the jungle
The wind in my hair and the sand at my feet

I've been having difficulties keeping to myself
Feelings and emotions better left up on the shelf

Animals and children tell the truth, they never lie
Which one is more human? There's a thought, now you decide

Compassion in the jungle, compassion in your hands
Yeah, yeah
Would you like to make a run for it? Would you like to take my hand?
Yeah, yeah

Sometimes this life can get you down
It's so confusing, there's so many rules to follow
And I feel it, 'cause I just run away in my mind

When superstars and cannonballs are running through your head
Television freak show, cops and robbers everywhere

Animals and children tell the truth, they never lie
Which one is more human, there's a thought now you decide

Compassion in the jungle, compassion in your hands

I want to live, like animals
Careless and free, like animals
I want to live, I want to run through the jungle
The wind in my hair

I wanna live
Hey, I want to live
So I want to live, like animals
I want to live, like animals
Like animals

I want to feel it, like animals
I want to feel it, like animals
I don't feel it, like animals
I want to feel it, like animals
