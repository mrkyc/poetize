Well, don't you know I need a little indulgence?
We'll listen to the hunter becoming hunted
Every day there's a million advances
But don't be too forceful; you'll ruin your chances

Well, don't you know that time is a broken glass
That splinters against the wall?
But the picture's coming back now, baby
And I wanna take it all

Don't go making all these promises you know you cannot keep
There's a time to play a king and a time to be a thief
'Cause if you're making all these promises you know you cannot keep
You know time will be the thief and your fallen king will end up alone

So let your body move a little bit closer (Ooh, ah, ah, ah)
Silent like the sound proceeding a cyclone
Don't you know that powerful thinking (Ooh, ah, ah, ah)
Can be a force you don't wanna relinquish?

Well, don't you know that
They say that hanging on will justify the wait?
But patience and elated wisdom don't share a common phrase
You might also like
Don't go making all these promises you know you cannot keep
There's a time to play a king and a time to be a thief
'Cause if you're making all these promises you know you cannot keep
You know time will be the thief and your fallen king will end up alone

Well, I'm only hanging on for what goes down (Baby)
I'm floating high and my feet don't touch the ground
I'd take advantage but I can't see through this charade
So don't you, don't go make it harder than hell
(Don't go making promises, don't go making promises)
'Cause when it comes down to the making
You better be damned sure you can take it
Hey baby (Don't go making promises, don't go making promises)
Ooh-ooh
Ooh, oh baby
Don't you know, baby? Yeah

Don't go making all these promises you know you cannot keep
There's a time to play the king and a time to be a thief
'Cause if you're making all these promises you know you cannot keep
You know time will be the thief and your fallen king will end up alone
Don't go making all these promises you know you cannot keep
There's a time to play the king and a time to be a thief
'Cause if you're making all these promises you know you cannot keep
You know time will be the thief and your fallen king will end up alone, alone, alone
A fool, a fool, a lonely sorry fool
