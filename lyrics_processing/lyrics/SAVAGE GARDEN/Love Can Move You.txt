Get me through the heart of the freeway
I gotta see the lights up in New York City
I'm so close, I think I can hear the sound of the taxi siren symphony

Don't you want to feel amazing?
Baby, you know I do
You get back ten times what you give freely
Like my mamma told me

Love can move you, take you deeper every time
Can make the darkest moments, feel like heaven's come alive
Love can move you to a place inside your heart
Where you can fear no evil
Acceptance is a natural part of life

Climb into the heart of the subway
Creepin' like a snake into New York City
I'm so close, I think I can see those lights
Let the sun get closer to the ground now

Don't you want to feel amazing?
Baby, you know I do
You get back ten times what you give freely
Like my mamma told me
You might also like
Love can move you, take you deeper every time
Can make the darkest moments seem feel heaven's come alive
Love can move you to a place inside your heart
Where you can fear no evil
Acceptance is a natural part of life

It's about the one thing (Ah-ah)
It's about the one thing (Ah-ah)
Not about the kind of shoes you're wearing
Not about religion

And I breathe the love you've given
And I feel the love you've hidden
And though it's cold down here
Well, I can honestly say
I can still stay
That love can move you
That love can move you, baby
That love can move you
You know that that love can move you too, child

Love can move you, take you deeper every time
Can make the darkest moments seem feel heaven's come alive
Love can move you to a place inside your heart
Where you can fear no evil (You know that love can move you baby)
Acceptance is a natural part of life
Love can move you, take you deeper every time
Can make the darkest moments seem feel heaven's come alive
Love can move you to a place inside your heart
Where you can fear no evil
