Hey
If we can't find our way out of these problems
Then maybe we don't need this
Standing face to face
Enemies at war, we build defenses
And secret hiding places

I might need you to hold me tonight
I might need you to say it's alright
I might need you to make the first stand
'Cause tonight, I'm finding it hard to be your man

Hold me tonight
Oh yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Say it's alright

Hey, yeah
More than angry words
I hate this silence
It's getting so loud
Well, I wanna scream
Bitterness has silenced these emotions
It's getting hard to breathe
So tell me, isn't happiness
Worth more than a golden diamond ring?
I'm willing to do anything
To calm the storm in my heart
I've never been the praying kind
But lately I've been down upon my knees
Not looking for a miracle
Just a reason to believe
You might also like
I might need you to hold me tonight
I might need you to say it's alright
I might need you to make the first stand
'Cause tonight, I'm finding it hard to be your man

Do you remember not long ago
How we used to live for the night time?
Cherish each moment
Now we don't live, we exist
We just run through our lives
So alone
That's why you've gotta hold me

Hey, yeah
If we can't find our way out of these problems
Then maybe we don't need this
Standing face to face
Enemies at war, we build defenses
And secret hiding places

I might need you to hold me tonight
I might need you to say it's alright
I might need you to make the first stand
'Cause tonight, I'm finding it hard to be your man
Hold me tonight
I might need you to say it's alright
I might need you to make the first stand
'Cause tonight, I'm finding it hard to be your man
Hold me tonight
Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Say its alright
Oh, yeah yeah
I might need you to make the first stand
'Cause tonight, I'm finding it hard to be your man
Hold me tonight
Oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Say its alright
Hold me tonight
