Show me the way to the promised land
The fever that burns in my heart
You're the fire inside the man, yes you are
Whenever I feel like just giving up
Whenever my dreams just fade away
I just return to my heart
'cause I know that I'll find you there - yes I will
And when the world is closing in
You come save me once again
'cause woman I need your guiding hand
Show me the way to the promised land
The fever that burns in my heart
You're the fire inside the man, yes you are
Well, there's never been a boy who's luckier
There's never been a more grateful man
And although I don't show it and
I know what I've got with you, yes I do
'cause woman I need your guiding hand
Show me the way to the promised land
The fever that burns in my heart
You're the fire inside the man, yes you are
