We were standing all alone
You were leaning in to speak to me
Acting like a mover shaker, dancing to Madonna
Then you kissed me
And I think about it all the time
Sweet temptation rush all over me
And I think about it all the time
Passion, desire so intense, I can't take anymore, because

I feel the magic all around you
It's bringing me to my knees
Like a wannabe
I've gotta be chained to you

And when you looked into my eyes, felt a sudden sense of urgency
Fascination cast a spell and you became more than just a mystery
And I think about you all the time
Is this fate, is it my destiny?
Yeah, I think about you all the time
I no longer pretend to have my hands on the wheel, because

I feel the magic all around you
It's bringing me to my knees
Like a wannabe
I've gotta be chained to you
(I feel the magic all around you)
I feel the magic all around you
It's bringing me to my knees
Like a wannabe
I've gotta be chained to you, you, you
You might also like
And I think about you all the time
Yeah, I think about it all the time
Tell me it's madness, I barely know you
We were standing all alone, you were leanin' in to speak to me
Ten steps back, you're still a mystery
Acting like a mover shaker, dancing to Madonna
Then you kissed me
I can't take anymore, because

I feel the magic all around you
It's bringing me to my knees
Like a wannabe
I've gotta be chained to you
I feel the magic building around you
I feel the magic all around you
It's bringing me to my knees
Like a wannabe
I've gotta be chained to you

Tell me it's madness
I barely know you
I feel the magic all around you (All around you)
It's bringing me to my knees
Like a wannabe
Ooh yeah
I've gotta be chained to you
I feel the magic building around you
I feel the magic all around you
It's bringing me to my knees
Like a wannabe
I've gotta be chained to you
Tell me it's madness
I barely know you
I feel the magic all around you (It's all around you)
It's bringing me to my knees
