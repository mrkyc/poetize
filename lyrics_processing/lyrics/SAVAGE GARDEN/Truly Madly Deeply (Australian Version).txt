I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish, I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love, be everything that you need
I love you more with every breath, truly, madly, deeply do
I will be strong, I will be faithful, 'cause I'm counting on a

New beginning, a reason for living
A deeper meaning, yeah

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

And when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky
I'll make a wish, send it to Heaven, and make you want to cry
The tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty
That we're surrounded by the comfort and protection of the

Highest powers, in lonely hours (Hours)
The tears devour you

Until the sky falls down on me

Oh, can you see it, baby?
You don't have to close your eyes
It's standing right before you
All that you need will surely come
I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish, I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love, be everything that you need
I'll love you more with every breath truly, madly, deeply do
Mm-mm, yeah

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me
I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
Well, I want to live like this forever (ooh)
Until the sky falls down on me
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, oh-oh
