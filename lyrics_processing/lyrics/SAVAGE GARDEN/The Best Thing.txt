Never want to fly, never wanna leave
Never wanna say what you mean to me
Never want to run, frightened to believe
You're the best thing about me

Sometimes I feel like this is only chemistry
Stuck in a maze, searching for a way to
Shut down, turn around, feel the ground beneath me
You're so close; where do you end where do I begin?
Always pushin' and pullin'
Sometimes sanity takes vacation time on me
I'm in a daze, stumblin' bewildered
North of gravity, head up in the stratosphere
You and I, roller coaster ride in love
You're the center of adrenaline
And I'm beginning to understand

Never want to fly, never wanna leave
Never wanna say what you mean to me
Never want to run, frightened to believe
You're the best thing about me

Walk on broken glass, make my way through fire
These are the things I would do for love
Farewell peace of mind, kiss goodbye to reason
Up is down; the impossible occurs each day
This intoxication thrills me
I only pray it doesn't kill me
You might also like
Never want to fly, never wanna leave
Never wanna say what you mean to me
Never want to run, frightened to believe
You're the best thing about me

You're the center of adrenaline
And I'm beginning to understand
You could be the best thing about me, oh (About me, oh)

Never want to fly, never wanna leave
Never wanna say what you mean to me
Never want to run, frightened to believe
You're the best thing about me
Never want to fly, never wanna leave
Never wanna say what you mean to me
Never want to run, frightened to believe
You're the best thing about me
You could be the best thing about me, oh
You're the best thing about me
You could be the best thing about me, oh no no
You're the best thing about me
What if you're the best thing about me, oh?
You're the best thing about me
You could be the best thing about me, oh no no
You're the best thing about me
Never want to fly, never wanna leave
You're the best thing about me
Never want to run, frightened to believe
You're the best thing about me
