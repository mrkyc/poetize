If there's a way that you could
Be everything you want to be
Would you complain that it came
Too easy?
Just like the games with you and me
A resolution hard to see
But that's okay 'cause I don't
See things that are plain to see
I've got a dream to take you over
Exploding like a supernova
And I'm gonna crash into your world
And that's no lie

You wanna give exctasy delivered with certainty
But you're afraid the pleasure won't be needed
In a way, we're the same two people looking out to sea
For a wave that will carry all our fantasies

Well, if there's a way to infiltrate you
Sway your mind and complicate you
Well, I'm gonna crash into your world
And that's no lie
You might also like
Let your body move into the doorway
To the disco inside you head (Violet)
Wear a colour that you want to cling to
The color inside your head (Violet)

Contemplate jealousy intermixed with urgency
A million things take a damned good shot at you and me

Well, if there's a way to infiltrate you
Sway your mind and complicate you
Well, I'm gonna crash into your world
And that's no lie

Let your body move into the doorway
To the disco inside you head (Violet)
Wear a colour that you want to cling to
The color inside your head (Violet)

(Dance) To the disco
(Dance) To the disco
(Dance) To the disco
(Dance) To the disco
I'm gonna take you
I'll do my best to break you
I'm gonna take you higher
And that's no lie
Well, common sense is a game
Many people don't like to play
But give it in and the moment takes you either way

Well, I've got a dream to take you over
Exploding like a supernova
I'm gonna crash into your world
And that's no lie

So let your body move into the doorway
To the disco inside you head, no (Violet)
Wear a colour that you want to cling to
The coulor inside your head (Violet)
So let your body move into the doorway
To the disco inside you head, no (Violet)
Wear a colour that you want to cling to
The coulor inside your head (Violet)

If there's a way that you could
Be everything you want to be
Would you complain that it came to you too easy? (Violet)
In a way we're the same two people Looking out to sea
