For a worldwide confrontation
Why don't you wise up to the words
Of Haig delivered through Reagan
Exposing a commie campaign
For world domination
Let's have some more mass
Extermination
Genocide
Down at the Sumpul river
Children of eight
Can go and get raped
Why don't you get a bayonet
Mince up a peasant or two?
Just remember, remember
America's right behind you!
(She's right behind you)
(She's right behind you) At all costs we've got to stop the Reds
(She's right behind you) Who wants to hear about 1000 peasants lying dead
(She's right behind you) At all costs we've got to stop the Reds
(She's right behind you) Who wants to hear about 1000 peasants lying dead
Remember the 50s and Mr. McCarthy
Let's have a witch hunt and nuclear party
Reagan's on TV, he's a nice kind of guy
He appears on the news without a collar and tie
He could press the button and he would survive
He could rule the world 'cause he's got God on his side
God's on his side
God's on his side
God's on his side
