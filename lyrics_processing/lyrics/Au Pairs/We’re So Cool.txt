I don't mind if you want to bring somebody home
To spend the
N-n-n-n-n-n-n-night
N-n-n-n-n-n-n-night
N-n-n-n-n-n-n-night
N-n-n-na
I don't mind your casual affairs
Your one-night stands
Because I know that I'm, I'm the main man
In your
L-l-l-l-l-l-l-life
L-l-l-l-l-l-l-life
L-l-l-l-l-l-l-life
L-l-l-la
And you know I don't mind if you leave me behind when you go away for a couple of days
But you know that I could come too and I wouldn't intrude, wouldn't make any fuss
'cause things are so cool
Things are cool between us
Things are cool between us
Things are cool between us
Things are cool
Your affection is ultimately mine
Remember from the start
I won't take up all of your time
I am in your heart
I'm in your heart
I'm in your heart
I'm in your heart
I'm in your heart
