Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh

I'm scared to try 'cause I'm scared to fail
I'm scared to die 'cause I'm scared of hell
I'm scared to kiss, I'm scared to hug
I'm scared of sex 'cause I'm scared to touch
I'm scared to look 'cause I'm scared to see
I'm scared of you 'cause I'm scared of me
I'm scared to fly, I'm scared to crash
I'm scared to move on so I live in the past

I'm scared to fight 'cause I'm scared to bleed
I'm scared of love 'cause I'm scared he'll leave
I'm scared of drugs, I'm scared to drink
I'm scared to swim 'cause I'm scared to sink
I'm scared to learn 'cause I'm scared of truth
Don't wanna gain weight 'cause I'm scared of food
I'm scared to think that the label dropped me
I'm scared to think of my album floppin'

Scared to share a secret 'cause I'm scared you'll tell
