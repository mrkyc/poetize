Oh, oh
Oh, Oh

My foolish heart it made me fall in love with him
I know it goes with how it's feeling
Oh, oh, oh
My foolish heart was broken when he left us in the cold
Now I'm left to fix the pieces
Oh, oh, oh

I told you once I told you twice, the next time I won't be so nice
You so quick to give it up, when you don't think about us (You don't think about us)
I won't let you keep (keep) hurting me, if you gone keep causing me pain
I won't let you keep (keep) hurting me, I'm 'bout to take you out the game

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh, oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh, oh

My foolish heart will jump into the deepest of the seas, even if it cannot swim
Oh, oh, oh
My foolish heart will trust just anyone, it's so naive
And I'm left to save it again
Oh, oh, oh

Maybe we should spend time apart

Driving me crazy, I can't take it no more
