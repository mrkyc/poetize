This is a Jazmine exclusive (Oh...)
We gon take 'em to the club like this

Packin' up my shh... and I'm goin' real far
Goin' off to Hollywood to be a big star
There's nothin' here for me so I gotta move fast
And I'm gettin' on the road and won't never look back, hey

I gotta dream big (Dream big)
'Cause when it happen, it's gon' happen real quick (Woo)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) Yes I feel it, I gotta
I gotta move fast (Oh-oh)
'Cause when it happen, I can't let it go past
Only get one chance
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)

Can't spend another second sittin' on my momma's couch
So if I don't take a chance, I won't ever get out
Some people talk but never do, they just runnin' they mouth
But I mean just what I say and I'ma show 'em what I'm about, yeah

I gotta dream big (I gotta dream big)
'Cause when it happen, it's gon' happen real quick (Oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) Yes I feel it, I gotta
I gotta move fast (Oh-oh)
'Cause when it happen, I can't let it go past
Only get one chance
