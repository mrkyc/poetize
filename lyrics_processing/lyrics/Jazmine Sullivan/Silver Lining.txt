I may not have a reason to think so
I know
But today I think I'm gone win the lottery
Or maybe when I finally get home
That job I need they gone call to hire me
So if I'm looking up don't mind me
But I can't be, (I just can't be) I can't be down no more
And if you don't know where to find me
I'm out looking
I'm looking for the silver lining
The silver lining, and I don't know where
But I'm hoping I'll find it
I'm looking for the silver lining

Everybody's looking at me like I'm crazy
And I am maybe, but my bed is changing right now
Hands up cause motherfucker this is a stick up
But don't be scared cause listen I ain't come to hurt nobody
I just want all your money in your wallet out your pocket

So if I'm looking up don't mind me
But I can't be, (I just can't be) I can't be down no more
And if you don't know where to find me
I'm out looking
I'm looking for the silver lining
The silver lining, and I don't know where
But I'm hoping I'll find it
I'm looking for the silver lining

Listen I'm a good citizen, I'm not a criminal
But I ain't holding up off of the minimum
I got kids that I gotta support
But doing this was my last resort
But you can't be meek when you've got mouths to feed
When you've got bills to pay and rent is late
I bet you'd do what you have to

So if I'm looking up don't mind me
But I can't be, (I just can't be) I can't be down no more
And if you don't know where to find me
I'm out looking
I'm looking for the silver lining
The silver lining, and I don't know where
But I'm hoping I'll find it
