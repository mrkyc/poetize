I bust the windows out your car
And, no, it didn't mend my broken heart
I'll probably always have these ugly scars
But right now, I don't care about that part
I bust the windows out your car
After I saw you laying next to her
I didn't wanna, but I took my turn
I'm glad I did it 'cause you had to learn

I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when
You see you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

I bust the windows out your car
You know I did it 'cause I left my mark
Wrote my initials with a crowbar
And then I drove off into the dark
I bust the windows out your car, ha
You should feel lucky that was all I did
After 5 whole years of this bullshit
Gave you all of me and you played with it, ooh, woah

I bust the windows out your car
But it don't compare to my broken heart, ha
You could never feel how I felt that day
Until it happens, baby, you don't know pain, ooh
Yeah, I did it (Yeah, I did it), you should know it (You should know it)
I ain't sorry (I ain't sorry), you deserved it (You deserved it)
After what you did to me (After what you did, uh)
You deserved it (You deserved it), I ain't sorry no, no, oh (I ain't sorry, no, I ain't sorry)

You broke my heart, so I broke your car (You caused me pain)
You caused me pain, so I did the same
Even though what you did to me was much worse
I had to do something to make you hurt, yeah
Oh, but why am I still crying?
Why am I the one who's still crying? Huh
Oh, oh, you really hurt me, baby
You really, really hurt me, baby
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Now, watch me you, haha
Now, watch me you
