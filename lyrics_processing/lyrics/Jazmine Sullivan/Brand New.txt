If I had a dime for every nigga with a rap dream
And all the girls that be riding working two jobs
But her boy stays at home making mixtapes
With a "Don't Disturb" on the doorknob
Then I buy a cheap dress every Friday
Cause I go to every show on the weekend
And I gotta look good when I'm reppin' him
He say he about to sign a deal, he about to blow
And gotta move to Atlanta, we about to go
I finally see the light and I'm glad I stayed
But the label said he should be single
Wait, what he saying?

Well baby fuck you and then the new crew you're rollin' with
They don't know you like I do
I swear when niggas start making money, they start acting funny
There's no love when they come up
They get brand new
They get brand new
This one's for
All the baby mamas and the down ass chicks
Remember y'all used to take bathroom pics, In the crib
And he said if he ever got rich, we'd be out this bitch
Can you believe that shit?
But now you're living good while I'm sitting home
He's probably messing with them hoes, I know
That's so brand new

And my bitches calling me like "Hey
Ain't that your nigga with Ye, ain't that your nigga with Jay?"
God damn I'm so embarrassed
But I ain't gon' call 'em, cause I've been drinking
But I'm getting madder cause this liquor got me thinking
Now I'm dialing your phone
Cause we both know that I deserve the throne
(I'm sorry, this number has been disconnected)
This ain't fair, who was there?
Who was lovin' you?

Well baby fuck you and then the new crew you're rollin' with
They don't know you like I do
I swear when niggas start making money, they start acting funny
There's no love when they come up
They get brand new
They get brand new
This one's for
All the baby mamas and the down ass chicks
Remember y'all used to take bathroom pics, In the crib
And he said if he ever got rich, we'd be out this bitch
Can you believe that shit?
But now you're living good while I'm sitting home
He's probably messing with them hoes, I know
That's so brand new
Never thought that you would act so brand new
