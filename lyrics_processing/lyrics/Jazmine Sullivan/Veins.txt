When did you realize that addiction was your life?
The first time I pushed it through my veins
The hug it gave me, I never experienced in my life
It wouldn't let me go

Writing's on the wall but I can't see the words
It's right in front of me but my vision is blurred
And is this love that makes the clear eye blurred?
Is this love that has me losing my mind?

When he calls your name and you just gotta have it
Love me all the wrong ways, my bad habit
Hold me close, while you take me away

(I just wanna scream your name)
Oooh I like that
Oooh t-t-tap that
I'ma call you daddy
(You make me go insane)
Oooh do me right
Do me all night
Cause you give me life
Runnin' through my veins
Runnin' through my veins
Veins

Now I can't live without him cause he's all that I breathe
I don't hang out much cause he's all that I need

Hit it once, feels so good, hurt so bad, had enough
Pull me back, tear me out, fuck me up
I never know, at least we go together babe
(Just stay with me and I'll only love you)
Forget about your worries, live it up like we're young
Cause life's too short not to have fun
You be holding it down
Knock a couple more rounds
That feel good pain while you're running through my, my
My veins
Oooh I like that
Oooh t-t-tap that
I'ma call you daddy
(You make me go insane)
Oooh do me right
Do me all night
Cause you give me life
Runnin' through my veins
Veins veins veins veins
Runnin' through my veins
Veins veins veins veins
