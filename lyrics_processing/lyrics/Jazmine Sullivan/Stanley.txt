I'm in the kitchen
Making the dinner that I know you like
And I've been cleaning this damn house
All day and all night
But you don't pay me no attention, Stanley
I'm needing your attention, baby
Just show me some appreciation
Or maybe take a bitch to dinner

Sometimes make me feel special, Stanley
I really shouldn't have to tell you, baby
This isn't how you treat a lady
Don't you know you got a winner?

I don't know why I waste my time
When you don't care how hard I try to make you smile
(If you ain't careful) You gon' lose a good thing
You gon' lose a good thing

I try to dress up
And look like something just to turn you on
I'm spending money I don't got
Because you used to like my hair red, my nails done
But you don't pay me no attention, Stanley
I'm needing your attention, baby
Just show me some appreciation
Or maybe take a bitch to dinner

I don't know why I waste my time
When you don't care how hard I try to make you smile
(If you ain't careful) You gon' lose a good thing

I try so hard to be good to you, Stanley
But why don't you care and you take me for granted?
You know I love you but I'm getting tired
You might get burned cause you're playing with fire (Fire)
All you do is go to the bar
Worrying 'bout that rusty car
Mess around, you're gonna lose my heart
And another man is gonna do your part
