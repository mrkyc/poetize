I got a .45 in my Louis bag yeah
And I, I'ma always ride for my man yeah
If he got two strikes I'ma take the wrap
Cause that's what a real bitch do

Cause he always did what he had to do for me
I never have to worry 'bout a thing when I'm with 'em
More than the money and the clothes
And everything I know, is everything my heart beats for

And I'ma ride this bitch till the wheels fall off
(Cause when my nigga need me you know that I got him)
I'ma ride this bitch till the wheels fall off
(And I ain't gotta worry cause I know I don't doubt him)
My love's so deep, so deep for my nigga
I never let him go and I swear I never quit him
And I'ma ride this bitch till the wheels fall off
(I'm rollin' with my baby, he know that I'm ridin')
That hood love (hood love)
Is that good love (good love)
That hood love (hood love)
Is that good love (good)
