Why can't I find somebody else
When I know, know that you're doing wrong
It's so hard, hard to let go

I done went through just about two bags of tissues, baby
And you're looking at me like you ain't the issue, baby
And though I tried to leave, I can't stop missing you, baby
And I keep coming, I keep coming back

I keep going in circles, circles
'Round and 'round
And while you're doing me so wrong
I just keep holding you down
I feel so stupid, foolish
Loving you all this way
But what I can I say?
But I wanna go
I wanna go but I keep coming back

Why I'm so confused for you, I have no answer boy (One time!)
When I feel so used by you just like a toy (Two times!)
It's a shame that you don't care enough
To even give me half the love I gave to you
I live for you, baby
I'm ashamed to say that I'm to blame for how you act
'Cause I keep coming, I keep coming back

I can't stop, I
I can't stop, I can't stop missing you baby
I, I, I can't stop
I, I, I can't

I stay 'cause I love you, but I hate that I stay
You know I won't go, that's why you treat me this way
I wanna be happy though it hurts me so bad
Don't know what it is that keeps me coming back

Hol' up (wait a minute)
I said hol' up (wait a minute)
I said hol' up (wait a minute)
I said freeze!

I feel so stupid, foolish
Loving you all this way
