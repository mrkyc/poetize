Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I wanna be good to you baby, ooh
(Call me crazy, but I think I found the love of my life, that's right)
Have you ever felt warm on a cold, cold night?
How it gets you when you least expect it, and you can't reject it (Ooh-ooh)
That crazy little tingling feeling pain in your chest, yes

You feel that fire, just let it burn (That's love)
'Cause there's no runnin' when it's your turn
(Call me crazy, but I think I found the love of my life)
Just let it burn
Let it, let it burn
Just let it burn
Let it, let it burn
(Call me crazy, but I think I found the love of my life)

Feel it creeping in your heart
Ooh baby, can you feel it tearing you apart?
That's right, that's love
When it comes, you never wanna give it up
And baby, I'm caught in the light and I ain't gonna fight it
There's no use in tryin', I'm yours
And I want you to want me the way that I want you and more, ooh
(So if you ready to take this ride)
(We can go all around the world, baby)
(****, we could even go to the stars if you like)
I know it's scary
'Cause someone always get hurt when you care
And I felt that way too
But ready or not, it's coming for you
