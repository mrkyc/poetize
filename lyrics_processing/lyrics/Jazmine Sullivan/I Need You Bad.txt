What you ah deal wit?
We come true a lot
A tings you know?
So what happened to you?
Me make one
Little mistake
You want done us?
If I had you back in my world
I would prove that I could be a better girl
Oh, oh, oh
If you let me back in I would sure enough never
Never let you go again
(Hey, baby)
I was so foolish to ever leave your side
Searching for what was right
Before my eyes it was me
Who didn't realize till it was gone
But now I know I need you in my life

Boy I need you bad as my heartbeat
(Bad like the food I eat)
Bad as the air I breath
(Baby, I want you bad)
I need you bad I can't take this pain
(Bad I can't take this pain)
Boy I'm 'bout to go insane
(Baby, I need you bad)
I need you
I need you
What I gotta do
(Baby I want you bad)
I need you
I need you
Do it all for you
(Baby, I need you)
Baby there's nothing I wouldn't do
To get back what we had
When love was true
(Oh, oh, oh)
No lie I'd give up all I got
Just so I could get back in my spot
(Oh)
