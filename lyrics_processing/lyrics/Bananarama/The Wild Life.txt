What your mother don't know, she won't mind
Her good advice was a waste of time
You wanna live fast, cutting it fine?
Make hay while the sun shines

No one there to say you're wrong or right
You've waited a lifetime
Burning all your bridges tonight

This is the wild life (wild life)
It's the wild life (wild life)
Wild life (wild life)
This is the wild life (wild life)

No stone left unturned
Jump in the fire, you're gonna get burned
You might lose your way when you come out to play
The wild life

I may be too young, but I've seen and done
Everything that they say is fun
I gotta find out for myself
In the end, there's no one else
You might also like
Every time I try to win, I lose
I'm tired of waiting
Now I'm gonna make my own rules

This is the wild life (wild life)
It's the wild life (wild life)
Wild life (wild life)
This is the wild life (wild life)
This is the wild life (wild life)
It's the wild life (wild life)
Wild life (wild life)
This is the wild life (wild life)

No stone left unturned
Jump in the fire, you're gonna get burned
You might lose your way when you come out to play
The wild life

No one there to say you're wrong or right
You've waited a lifetime
Burning all your bridges tonight
This is the wild life (wild life)
It's the wild life (wild life)
Wild life (wild life)
This is the wild life (wild life)
This is the wild life (wild life)
It's the wild life (wild life)
Wild life (wild life)
This is the wild life (wild life)

No stone left unturned
Jump in the fire, you're gonna get burned
You might lose your way when you come out to play

This is the wild life (wild life)
It's the wild life (wild life)
Wild life (wild life)
This is the wild life (wild life)
This is the wild life (wild life)
It's the wild life (wild life)
Wild life (wild life)
This is the wild life (wild life)
No stone left unturned
Jump in the fire, you're gonna get burned
You might lose your way when you come out to play
