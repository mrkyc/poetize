I'm not here to stand and wait in line
Way too many calls you pressed decline
Said that we'd go to Paris
But now suddenly you're embarrassed of me
Just another tall tale
Now it's like you're never here at all
Spending time behind digital walls
Haunted house, you're the ghost I can't see
Going on as if we were to be
Something real

No longer am I your flavour of the month
Say it to my face now, tell me the truth for once

You said I was your favourite
But now you're just complacent
My heart grows impatient
But I won't be chasing
You won't find a better
Find a better replacement

Never saw you rolling up your sleeves
Leaving all the hard work down to me
Wasn't asking for your hand in marriage
Didn't need all your extra baggage
Won't stay in heartbreak hotel
You might also like
No longer am I your flavour of the month
Say it to my face now, tell me the truth for once

You said I was your favourite
But now you're just complacent
My heart grows impatient
But I won't be chasing
You won't find a better
Find a better replacement
You said I was your favourite
But now you're just complacent
My heart grows impatient
But I won't be chasing
You won't find a better
Find a better replacement

No longer am I your flavour of the month
Say it to my face now, tell me the truth for once
No longer am I your flavour of the month
Say it to my face now, tell me the truth for once
You said I was your favourite
But now you're just complacent
My heart grows impatient
But I won't be chasing
You won't find a better
Find a better replacement
You said I was your favourite
But now you're just complacent
My heart grows impatient
But I won't be chasing
You won't find a better
