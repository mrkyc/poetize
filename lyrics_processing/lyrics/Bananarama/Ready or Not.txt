The last time I saw your face
I heard you cry
Terrified
When they took you to another place
But now I can see you smile
There's a wall that divides us
Never forgive
The right to live
And all the love that they deny us
Ready or not I'm coming
And I'm gonna find you baby
So you better start running
Ready or not I'm coming
And I'm gonna get to you
No matter what they do
Ready or not I'm coming
Creeping up behind you baby
Let me tell you something
Ready or not I'm coming
Bringing all my love to you
But am I getting through?
Am I getting through?
You might also likeI send all my love to you
One chance to make it through
Shadows fall
Can't hear me call
But my heart goes out to you
Ready or not I'm coming
And I'm gonna find you baby
So you better start running
Ready or not I'm coming
And I'm gonna get to you
No matter what they do
Ready or not I'm coming
Creeping up behind you baby
Let me tell you something
Ready or not I'm coming
Bringing all my love to you
But am I getting through?
I'll never give up the fight
Never be satisfied
Till we stand
Hand in hand
Touching freedom on the other side
But it's getting harder now
To live and take orders
Risking my life
Tonight's the night
Heading over the border
Ready or not I'm coming
And I'm gonna find you baby
So you better start running
Ready or not I'm coming
And I'm gonna get to you
No matter what they do
Ready or not I'm coming
Creeping up behind you baby
Let me tell you something
Ready or not I'm coming
Bringing all my love to you
