One two three...
Wait wait wait, what's the first line again ?
Help !

One two...
Help !
No wait !
Sorry
One two three four

(Help!) I need somebody
(Help!) Not just anybody
(Help!) You know I need someone
(Help!)

When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
You might also likePete, look, I think I'm a bit toppy
And I'm a bit bottomy, Pete

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
HELP!
And I do appreciate you being 'round
HELP!
Help me get my feet back on the ground
HELP!
Won't you please, please help me?
They're gonna take the Bananas off 'ere aren't they ?
Yeah. They're just doing backing vocals. We're singing the medley
Well, we better be. Otherwise there'll be trouble
Hm, hm !
