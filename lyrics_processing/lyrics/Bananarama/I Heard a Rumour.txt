Who needs friends who never show?
I'll tell you what you wanna know
I could have saved a broken heart
If I'd found out long ago
I'm just thinking about those lonely nights
When I waited on your call
Till I found out my friends were right
I didn't know you at all

I heard a rumour (Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour)
They say you've got a broken heart (I heard it)
I heard a rumour  (Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour)
Yes, I did, boy (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Now it seems they're telling me
You've changed your wicked ways
But should I give you a second chance?
Baby, I'm too afraid
So you realise what hurt you made
And the love you threw away
How can I forgive or soon forget?
It's never gonna be the same
