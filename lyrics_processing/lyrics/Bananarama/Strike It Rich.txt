Whoever said the best things are free
Let me tell you it don't come easy
Life's a game but I still believe
You have to take it seriously
The world tells so many lies
They say
Money talks, hum
But listen to me
Gotta take control
And you can never stop
You gotta keep on climbing till you reach the top
Never giving up
Ain't life a bitch
You gotta keep on going till you strike it rich
Don't let them tell ya you ain't got a soul
Only sinners cast the first stone
And even if the sidewalk ain't gold
Anyone can be bought and sold
The world tells so many lies
They say
Money talks, hum
But listen to me
