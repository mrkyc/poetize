Call me jenny jenny when I cry
With me big black empty handbag
You give me little lollie when we hungry
Give me Coca-Cola when we dry
In the good times and the bad times
That's right
Spending all me jarre
Smoking all the time
In Cairo
Making all the junk for the big man
In Cairo
Spending all me jarre
Smoking all the time
In Cairo
Doing all I can for the big man
Cairo
Under heavy menace in the day time
Under heavy hoola in the night
With me milkshake and no handshake
Singing in the morning like a tourist
Working for me money all the time
For the big wheel and the high heel
That's right
