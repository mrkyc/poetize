My friends and I, all lost each other
I didn't want the weekend to be over
Stood at the cash point trying to look sober
That's when I saw
That's when I saw you
Stood in the middle
Of a very long queue
It was a lost weekend
We turned our phones off, ignored our friends
I found my knees weakened
I know I'd never see you again
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you
By saying something stupid like 'I love you'
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you
By saying something stupid like 'I love you'
It was a lost weekend
We took our clothes off and made no sense
I found my knees weakened
I threw myself into the deep end
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you
By saying something stupid like 'I love you'
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you
It was a lost weekend
You might also likeI knew a shortcut and I showed you how
I held your hand to take you through the crowd
Danced to a song that I still don't know
It was late, I was drunk, it was the radio, oh, yeah
I wish you could've stay there forever with me
But the people in the chip shop, they asked us to leave
Remember when I asked you for your number
And your hands up underneath my jumper, over and over and over
It was a lost weekend
We turned our phones off, ignored our friends
I found my knees weakened
I know I'd never see you again
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you
By saying something stupid like 'I love you'
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you
By saying something stupid like 'I love you'
It was a lost weekend
It was a lost weekend
It was a lost weekend
It was a lost weekend
Lost weekend
Lost weekend
Lost weekend
