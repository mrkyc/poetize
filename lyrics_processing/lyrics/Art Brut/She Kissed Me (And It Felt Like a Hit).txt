I don't care about your friends eye rolling
All over the table hand-holding
Let's go to the cinema and sit in the back
Because we don't want the film distracting us
Then spend our nights drinkin' gin
And the daytime sleeping in
Under the covers, bein' rude
Only coming out for takeaway food

Keep going, don't stop
I feel like I'm on top of the pops
Keep going, don't stop
I feel like I'm on top of the pops

She kissed me and it felt like a hit
She kissed me and it felt like a hit
My heart, it was beatin', like a full drum kit
She kissed me and it felt like a hit

We invented a new way of walking home
I no longer have to do it alone
I used to stagger and sway
Still do, but now we kiss in every doorway
You might also like
Keep going, don't stop
I feel like I'm on top of the pops
Keep going, don't stop
I feel like I'm on top of the pops

She kissed me and it felt like a hit
She kissed me and it felt like a hit
My heart, was beatin', like a full drum kit
She kissed me and it felt like a hit

So I've been looking over at her all evening
But I'm just a bit too shy to approach her
And my friend said
"Evvy, I don't think it's gonna work out"
"Come on, let's just go home"
And I said, "No"
"I think I've got this, don't worry"
And I walked over
And then

She kissed me and it felt like a hit
She, she kissed me and it felt like a hit
I could taste the potential in it
She, she kissed me and it felt like a hit
Number one all summer long (Number one!)
Number one all summer long (Number one!)
Number one all summer long (Number one!)
We're number one all summer long (Number one!)
We're number one all summer long (Number one!)
We're Number one all summer long (Number one!)
