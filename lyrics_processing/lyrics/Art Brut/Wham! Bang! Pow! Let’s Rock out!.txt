I'm just looking for a party
I don't care what music they play
Beer bottle lids used as ashtrays
We'll make some enemies in the kitchen
Because we don't care whose booze we're drinking

Wham! Bang! Pow! Let's rock out!
There's a fire in my soul, I can't put it out
Wham! Bang! Pow! Let's rock out!
There's a fire in my soul, I can't put it out
Wham! Bang! Pow! Let's rock out!
There's a fire in my soul, I can't put it out
Wham! Bang! Pow! Let's rock out!
There's a fire in my soul, I can't put it out

Your girlfriends, we're gonna steal them
And leave footprints on the ceiling
I want to wake up smelling like smoke
Under a pile of strangers' coats

Wham! Bang! Pow! Let's rock out!
There's a fire in my soul, I can't put it out
Wham! Bang! Pow! Let's rock out!
There's a fire in my soul, I can't put it out
Wham! Bang! Pow! Let's rock out!
There's a fire in my soul, I can't put it out
Wham! Bang! Pow! Let's rock out!
There's a fire in my soul, I can't put it out
