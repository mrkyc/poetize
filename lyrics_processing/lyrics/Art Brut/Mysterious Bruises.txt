With the drink that made me feel invincible
I don't know how I managed to do this
But I woke up this morning covered in bruises
I only dance to songs I like
So I was sat down most the night
I don't know how I managed to do this
I woke up this morning covered in bruises
Hahahaha
I found a bruise on my arm, one on my knee
I can feel some more in a place I can't see
Is this a new bruise, or has it been there forever?
When did I do it, I can't remember
Can't remember anything I've done
I fought the floor and the floor won
I can't remember anything I've done
I fought the floor and the floor won
I can't remember anything I've done
I fought the floor and the floor won
I can't remember anything I've done
I fought the floor and the floor won
You might also likeI don't know how I managed to do this
But I woke up this morning covered in bruises
I'd finally decided to tell you how I felt
I mistakenly thought that the drink would help
I don't know what happened
The planets weren't aligned
I kept giving you a wink
You kept missing the sign
I can't remember anything I've done
I fought the floor and the floor won
I can't remember anything I've done
I fought the floor and the floor won
I can't remember anything I've done
I fought the floor and the floor won
I can't remember anything I've done
I fought the floor and the floor won
I finally managed to unravel the plot
It's not a happy ending, but it's the best that I've got
I woke up this morning covered in bruises
One Zirtec, two Advil are gonna get me through this
I finally managed to unravel the plot
It's not the happiest of endings, but it's the best that I've got
I finally managed to unravel the plot
It's not a happy ending, but it's the best that I've got
I had one Zirtec, two Advil
With the drink that made me feel invincible
I had one Zirtec, two Advil
Then I bounced around, just like a pinball
I had one Zirtec, two Advil
With the drink that made me feel invincible
I had one Zirtec, two Advil
