She's looking over a lot
And he's still in his work clothes
He can't talk to members of the opposite sex
He starts to talk, they start to look perplexed
So with his eyes on the prize, and just a glance at her breasts
He walks over, and he says

Get on the dancefloor, it's a direct hit
Move around like your shoes don't fit
Get on the dancefloor, it's a direct hit

She's been looking over a lot

She can't talk to members of the opposite sex
She starts to talk, they start to look perplexed
So with her eyes on the prize, and just a glance at her breasts
She goes over, and she says:
