Ease your mind and leave your heart with me
Keep your prize so you don't got to deep
Think or lie, read or write
Blink your eyes and breathe
Take your eyes where you don't have to be
Believe in the me (Oh really?)
I love the way you do it, you do it so swell

Uh, keep your minds, believe your mind
We may read more wine to see
It don't gotta be E or I resort side for free
For life can be, your private seashore
Why not be where you can breathe?
Believe in the me
Uh, uh, I love the way you do it, you do it so swell
Ease your mind and leave your heart with me
We gon' shine all week
You don't gotta decieve or sigh
Leave your logic beneath your eyes and speak your sign
Take your time like you don't have to leave
Believe in the me
It's free, indeed, peep
Your mind is mine
You don't gotta sleep, seek or fight the feeling inside
Just leave foresight behind just this time
I promise them problems will slide off them spine
Be the be that you knew you could be
Believe in the me
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah, I love the way you do it, you do it so, so swell
You might also like
Well I tried feeling it when I meant to just lie
Holding change like it never made sense to these eyes
Had to tell a old soul, "Yo, the chemistry died"
Bought a new one with wings, said he was sent to be fly
Bling black in, merch for the merchant dream catchers
Who emerged purple palettes over lush green pastures of life
Leap lavish landscapes when I write
Got the 7th, Ocean 11th opened, no assassin though
John Madden in a suit like the Mad Men dude
Pen a jewel like a maverick moves
Similar in Cannes, hit, smash, coast in my lane
Jane smoke, chain toke and deranged
Caine told 'em no joking this time
Had a black thought that would've left a hole in his mind
Let it spiral, notebook vinyl, flow so vital
Sliding through his mind like these lines do
Shouts to the Airtight Crew
Hold it down for them golden crowns, you know how I shoot
Verticl-i rhymes fly out the mic booth
Right into the risin' of horizons, sipping life juice
Skinny dipping out the fountain of youth
Vinny with it but the vision isn't, fat Miramax script I'm living
Written spitting with precision sitting
Opposition to a dizzy listing
Getting fo'head vaseline and butterfly bee stings
Keep your minds, believe your mind
We may read more wine to see
It don't gotta be E or I, resort side of free
For life can be your private seashore
Why not be where you can breathe?
Believe in the me
Uh, heh, yeah, I love the way you do it, you do it so, so swell

To all the newcomers, all I could do was wish you new summers
The Blu sun is among us, renew younger
Wonder why I told the sky don't idolize? Time is fly
Fuck around and you'll be in wings, tryna buy mine
Just a reminder why a titan's writing raps
When he could be realigning the stars straight off the map
Had to pull off the hat, had knowledge, I can offer that
Pardon if I'm darker than the usual, Arther Ashe
Soundscape needed, much larger than a musical
Cleaning out my cuticles, stuck up in the cubicle space
The theatre to see the truth through the day, to make it easier
Oil of Olay, what can I say but
Be the be that you knew you could be
Believe in the me
I love the way you do it, you do it so, so swell
Ease your mind and leave your heart with me
We gon' shine all week
You don't gotta decieve or sigh
Leave your logic beneath your eyes and speak your sign
Take your time like you don't have to leave
Believe in the me
