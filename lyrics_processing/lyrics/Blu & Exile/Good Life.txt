Yeah, haha (Show me the good life)
This is the story, of wealth (Show me the good)
Cash, whips, chips, bitches and blunts
(Show me the good life) Show me that shit
Must be the good life, right? (Show me the good)
Check this (Show me)

I got a call from my girl last week, she telling me
About that time of the month and how it may not come
Dropped the phone right before she said I might have a son
And I started asking God, "How come?"
I got dreams I ain't reached yet, ends that ain't meet yet
When it comes to being a man, shit I'm barely getting my feet wet
Tryna hit reset, knee deep in debt
Tryna figure how to feed a mouth that ain't got teeth yet
How the hell am I gon' show a child to be a man
When I'm twenty-two without a clue on how to take a stand
Against this system when it's just us? Wanna show him justice
But last year, I was just in cuffs
What the fuck am I supposed to do
When he's telling me, "Dad, I need some food?"
I'm looking down at my stomach and mine is grumbling too
What can I tell him when he's twenty-two
And he's asking me what the fuck I was thinking when mommy's tummy grew?
Was I scared? Was I getting prepared?
Or did I even think of leaving her without a father's care?
Should I tell him that it's hell here and life ain't fair?
Or should I try to make a change when he's pulling on my leg?
And he keeps on telling me to

There's a few things my poppa never told me
Maybe cause the stone's still rolling, no moss yet
It's a few things my momma never told me to mold me
But her soul is so golden the way she floss it
And I ain't mad at their secrets though
It's a hard sell to tell a young child about your deepest low
But I done seen through they weakness so
I understand a little bit on how defeats can slow
You so, far down that your meekness grow
And everyday gets colder when the breezes blow
Grand momma sat me down and said, 'you need to know
Boy you a little light in this world, let your heat just glow
Have patience, some things take time
And ain't no limit to the goals that you could hold in your mind'
Lift the soul when you climb, 'till you reach the gates of heaven
Like your chariot is carrying children who going blind
And you gon get 'em they sight back, when all they see is night black
Believe in everything that you doing and just like that
Things will happen for you, keep shining them rays
It's bright enough to spread grace over a million graves
Over a million slaves to bring honor to the elders
Who held us away from danger when the danger would've killed us
They never failed us but they souls have peace
And follow in their footsteps, you got brothers to keep
In this good life

It's so much I can show you without rolling through Beverly Hills
Without money, cars, clothes or even ecstasy pills
I don't need weed to ease me when I'm stressing for real
I just close my eyes and try to think how heaven feels
Just to feel good again, even though I know when I open them
It's back to the hood again where kids hold chrome with them
Just to feel protected cause the videos are showing them
How to shoot fools and take their dough from them
That's why I try to give my soul to them in lyrics I spit
They reject it cause they stressing for material shit
They're getting sick and tired of fighting over serial gifts
Cause they notice bitches go head over heels for the whips
And the chains and the chips, and the range and the clips
In the guns and the women and the fun living in cribs in the burbs
Fuck the slums, they want funds and they heard flippin' birds is
The ticket and they get it and run with it
Some slip and fall, others pause see the outcome and crawl
On the road for some change, cause the game is too hard
To play straight by the rules
I'm trying to stay out the news and make cake to buy food
Fuck jewels, I think my soul glows bright enough
And fuck whips, I learn more when I ride the bus
And fuck gold, it's bad enough that we fight for bucks
And fuck hoes cause in the end, I need a wife to love
Plus heaven is the life for us, so God
Show me the good life

Show me the good
Show me, yeah
