Uh, uh-huh
Yes yes, S-O-U-L
Hello? (Yeah)
Come on, come on
Yes yes y'all, come on, come on
Yes yes y'all, come on, come on
Yeah, party people, uh
It's so amazin'
It's so am-mazin'
It's so am-, it's so ama-ma-, 'mazin, zin'
From the, from, from the
From the, from the soul y'all

The soul provider, got a lot on the skillet
Grilling it hard-boiled, charcoal fillings, the dark villain
And the light-skinned niggas disguised, my mind's sickening
Define vicious written in rhymes, time tens it
To describe how my line's ending, your fine imprint
Described through your mind's index, my line chin-checks
And shine through your blinds instant, the sun syndicate
Fat as Biggie with no Pun intended
No pun intended to live, I pick up where we slid and run illest
'Til I buckle and become winded
And all the air from out my lungs slips into the sky like weed smoke
My peoples need hope and I'm the one with it
The soul provider, cold as fire, hot as ice
Rock the mic 'til I retire, die the son of Christ
Becoming one with life, to live like death is uncertain
One curtain left and I'ma die with my gun bursting
Tongue cursing 'til I must become one with the Earth
Heaven and Hell I conquer, whichever comes first
Known to rebel, my soul a la mode, uh
My soul a la mode, the soul provider
You might also like
I'ma hit you with the words that'll make your soul vibe
It's so amazin' (Why?) we still blazing
From the soul y'all
I'ma hit you with the words that'll make your soul vibe
Cause I know I got that soul

Sacred living, sinning like you can't forgive 'em
Suspending time with my time spent rhyming about nonsense
Like saving religion, drink sipping, letting my mind spin
Thinking 'bout my mom and pops, how they designed this
Nigga, a mix of Al Green and Pac
Rockin' soul tracks, rapping about surviving on the block
Black top, asphalt talk, walking through the fire
Like a soul provider, poppa made a dope rhymer
I'm a ghetto nigga sipping liquor in pajamas
Not old enough to rock clubs but still do
Real soul provider, I got a ill crew
And best believe they with me in the city like sex
Metropolitan connects, plus the Steel Crew still do dirt
Baggy jeans and my ill blue shirt
Feeling fresh, yes, while Ex' queue the keys
I'ma ease through your soul like you blowing trees
Best believe the soul provider
I'ma hit you with the words that'll make your soul vibe
It's so amazin' (Why?) we still blazing
From the soul y'all
I'ma hit you with the words that'll make your soul vibe
Cause I know I got that soul

Yo, I flow Krypton, knock your Superman off his feet
With his kicks on, niggas keep my shit on repeat
And no matter which song I get on, I shit on beats
Pull out my dick and take a piss on trees, I'm raw dogging it
Look, my rhyme lines flow sweeter than swine
So any mic that I find, I got the right to be hogging it
Talking shit, loudmouth, wild out, starting it
Alcoholic slaughtering my vocab department
So pardon if my talking is slurred, pants sagging
Hands grabbing on my nuts, clutch sparking my herb
Relaxed lingo, beef low, ghetto as Black bingo
Redefine the lines of rap singles
The soul provider, hold the mic and open fire
Drop my nuts, I give a fuck about a pro hire
The new Pete to C.L. is Exile and B-L, we bang Jeeps
To break beats, blaze trees and females, you ain't me
It's the S-O-U-L, provide your mind
With a West Coast soul vibe, uh
It's the S-O-U-L, provide your mind
With a West Coast soul vibe, yeah, the soul provider
It's so amazin'
It's so amazin'
So, it's so ama-
It's so ama-, it's so amazin'-zin'
It's so amazin'
It's so ama-, it's so amazin'
It's, it's so amazin'
It's, it's so ama-
