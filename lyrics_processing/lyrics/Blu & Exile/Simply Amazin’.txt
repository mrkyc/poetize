To all you talkin' all that bullshit (Yeah)
I'ma put it to you like this

Ayo, I'm tryna make these niggas go bonkers
From London to the youngest in Yonkers
We So-Cal residential lyrical monsters
Gettin' women's attention like I'm rippin' a concert
So put your hands high 'til your arms hurt
I walk the earth just like God works in mysterious ways
Your spirits is swayed, every time my lyrics is played
So please stop givin' these lyricists praise
Cause they bluffin' while they bustin' with a serious face
And it's unbearable, these stereo-rap tracks are terrible
I'm here to take care of you wack cats
And bury you back at wherever you came from
I'm carryin' this game on my back 'til the pain's numb
And I be bustin' on fucks 'til I can't cum no longer
Losses, you gotta take some to grow stronger
I've conquered all you haters like a strong-armed dominator
Big dick condom breaker, bit a' baby-mama maker
And ain't no time to take a break, you gotta break the mold
I'm from a place where cats are born to play the gangsta roles
Like hittin' switches, I was gettin' hit with switches
Until I switched positions, now I'm playin' when the game is on
Y'all think y'all bangin' but y'all ain't as strong
My pop a thug, I'm a son of a Blood with blue Gators on
The record spinnin' his favorite songs
Now he's bangin' my shit on them same tables that he played 'em on nigga

Hurry up and sing along with it (And it just starting)
If you didn't hear it, you gonna hear it right now

Cause yo, hip hop, it started out in the heart
A young nigga from the park sharp-shootin' with darts
Harpoonin' cartoonists talkin' too much talk
But walk a whole different stroll homeboy
You get sparked by the guy right here
I make y'all niggas see the light like a bright idea
Heard you was lookin' for my weapon but my tongue's right here
So you can act like a fool
But y'all be done by noon off of one light beer
So yeah, fuck my crew, but let's get one thing clear
Y'all can't keep up with us because your lungs ain't clear
Y'all need a million-dollar budget and some punch lines here
All your boy need is one right ear
And I could probably change the world, fuck you so-so rappers
After diamonds and pearls, like you homo rappers
Y'all some go-go girls, with your go-go gadgets
Exposin' what you holdin' like your soul don't matter
I got a "go-go get it" mentality, so battle me please
I just throw out some cheese and y'all'll go-go at it
Got you reachin' for your 4-4 'matic
While I stagger motherfuckers with darts, I got my mojo mastered
The game is full of homos backwards:
Mo' hoes than rappers, no flows but keep shows packing
And us? Fuck that, we goin' platinum plus
And still ridin' on the back of the bus cause the bucks don't matter
Turn it up, stop frontin' (Yeah)
Come on, turn it up (Let's go!)

And from the start of this shit
I took a vow to never part with this shit
I put my soul and all my heart in this shit
But in return, I got burned like these rappers had my arteries lit
So now I'm spittin' fire darts when I'm pissed
And you don't wanna see me angry cause I can't be calmed
It's like you tryna get custody of my sound, and I'm the baby's mom
I been in court for this wack shit before
And I had to file divorce so you biters would start payin' style support
A child that don't smile no more
I found the short cut in life, but I'd rather take my time out the door
Fuck a knife, I'm pullin' texts out for war
Cause I ain't good at cutting, fuck y'all think Exile is for?
See I'm the MC, and he's the DJ
Manipulate the MP to translate what he say
Catch me on the freeway
1-10 South 'til it ends at Bridgetown, USA (Bridgetown!)
So roll with us where the gorillas hang, where the cold killers live
Where the gold diggers dig, where you know niggas bang
Cause the walls show the gangs when you pass 'em
Where niggas stay blown like tires and these haters wanna slash 'em
Platinum chains, trained to snatch 'em
You flashin' in the Range? You waitin' for an accident to happen
On purpose, Cadillac verses
Sun-roofed diamond-back rap, that's the verdict, nigga
