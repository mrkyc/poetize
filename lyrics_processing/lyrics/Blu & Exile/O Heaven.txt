O, Heaven, how could I forget you?
Rose to the occasion, one day plucking petals
Stole something precious, should've been the way I left you
But no matter what's changed, sustain, be the best you
The rest grew restless as cousin's sleep
Wanted peace but the search wasn't deep
I invest in my week to see a brighter Monday morn', but
Woke up on Tuesday in the same uniform (Damn)
And through it all, I try not to do you wrong
As I have in the past, rapping other love songs
But it's kinda hard building lust when your trust gone
Money was the object of affect-, they ain't want Jean
Should've gone with my first love
Maybe moved out to Vigo and wrote books in cursive
Learned a little French and do the film I've been tryna make
And translate the feeling I was feeling at my modern-day
Took a break with the wiz, gave the rhymes a break
Busted hard enough to make the condom break
No seeds, no sticks, no stems
Old gems found crumbled by the bubble-goose and Timbs
I can hear the hymns and the choirs from the pews
Where Mom sat listening to Sunday's blues
In the scuffed penny loafs that I stuffed a nickel into
All-white Easter suit that won't fit you
Sent through Heaven to Hell to sell dreams of
Places once dwelled but I fell for the green stuff
Swore I could fly back and say hi again
But my money was no good, I needed time to spend
Brought me back to my youth when I was grinding with no loot
Book full of rhymes with the gold tooth
With the scripture engraved, over a picture of the days
When I dreamt of being richer, liquor pours
From the picture to the glass house
Built for lookers to remember the soul once 'membered: gone
Gotta find it in her
And we happily concur, ever after, one blur
Marry matching, one word: love
Found crumpled in notebooks you never saw
Belittled thoughts and yada-yada
Drama side, my, traumatized by, um
Falling off in the water, which was softer than the ground-level
Found holding soul of daisies without petals
How special
Oh heaven, how could I forget you?
