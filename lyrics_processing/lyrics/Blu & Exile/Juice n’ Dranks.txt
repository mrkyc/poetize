Your face up, we'll beat your fuckin' face up
Crass Knucks, Blu, uh
Ta'Raach (Okay) new school shit
Yeah, new, something
Old school to the (And new, mille')

Allow the flow to blow the steam
Hostile whenever I spit, you just swallow like it's part of the seam
Offin' the green like Tiger-Tiger Wood, just tryna lean
You might have tried if you could but it might have been
You like a bitch fall, why the bling?
Saying how that shit go, my cockiness keen
Niggas tryna get this cold, put rocks in they rings
It's like my face on they wrist glow, no
But them lines so tight they slit throats at shows
Hit your lights at midnight
I beat you with a kick and a snare, fuck a fist fight
We light it up in the air while you twist mics
Eleven steps to Heaven's in here, get your bitch right

Crass Knucks, keep this shit tight
Blow 'em up, uh, we'll blow your fuckin' face up
We celebratin' while you hatin'

Put your juice and drank up
A toast to the most and bank us

Mad cause you ain't us, here, put some light in your life
Put your juice and drank up
A toast to the most and bank us

Mad cause you ain't us, here, put some light in your life

It's like he ain't igniting it right, he ain't the rioting type
So tell him silence his pipes 'fore we invite him to fight
Cause I'll arrive in the height of the night
Spitting that spice that'll widen your wife
And have her asking you, "Why don't we fight
So I can leave and be with Blu cause he sliding me right?"
See I done put the fear of God up inside of her twice
So ain't nothin' you could tell her that is wiser, aight?
My shit is dynamite
I'll probably die on the mic, you out dining the mic
Just lyin' your life, so I'ma lie in your light
Take the lime from your life
And shine bright as a diamond with dimes dying as dykes
Tryna find that feeling I give her night after night
You left out, now I'm righter than right
And every rhyme that I write is like you writing a rhyme
Feeling my lines like life
Rising as high as my high without lighting the lye
So I'm like
Put your juice and drank up
A toast to the most and bank us
I sold hoes, pretty toes with anklets
Mad cause you ain't us, here, put some light in your life
Put your juice and drank up
A toast to the most and bank us
I sold hoes, pretty toes with anklets
Mad cause you ain't us, here, put some light in your life

Out the back door, kiss of death, don't get it confused
I'm a marksman on the ricochet, flow bite into food
Dudes tussling with cigarettes and hoes fight the blues
While I go and get these bigger checks then internet the news
So cold, it's like I'm in his breath and did his best to lose
When the rules say a minute left, I'll put you in the dark
I brought shadow for them nigga steps, give 'em best regards
Charged it to the game 'til they put a hold on his card
Crash knuckle, back up or catch a uppercut or two
Got knocked but got right back up to bust a few
High shot, moms and pops broke up so fuck rules
Getting laid plus paid doing what I wanna do
True rebel, see the cause? I'm effect
Many songs I'ma bless, any squads I'ma wreck
Any broad I'ma catch, any y'all wanna catch up? 'Fess up
Blu got fools in Detroit throwing the West up like
Put your juice and drank up
A toast to the most and bank us
I sold hoes, pretty toes with anklets
Mad cause you ain't us, here, put some light in your life
Put your juice and drank up
A toast to the most and bank us
I sold hoes, pretty toes with anklets
Mad cause you ain't us, here, put some light in your life

Yeah, Rock Steady, uh, Blu
Rock Royal, haha, and the crew
