Yea you know, business as uzh..
Whole lot of unofficial shit to do
I handle stress and ship Blues to whoever's amusing
Spit truth til it lit up the booth
KidI'm like the kid with the chipped tooth
Split with, Bishop in Juice or like
Don Juan Bishop how I'm pimpin' the truth
I pity them fools, swoopin through the city in jewels
Rented as uzh, in it for the Benjamins too
And so I'm mobbin
Why would I use it on fools gold?
When you know your true soul shines
You didn't know, nobody told you better?
Nobody every told you you can be somebody, ever?
Nobody ever said it would be easy, but geez!
I dream the pipe, scheming nightly on American cream
Still nobody believes, tryna get a free piece of these...
These dreams we sell to these fiends
And gel to these things
Bling-bling, sour cream on top of everything that
You will never think that we needed sour cream
Like, I don't know how I'm lean cause I love sour cream!
Give me cheese, give me green, bread is all I need
Head is all I need, We bled for all of these
Things that I, think I'm in a dream boat floatin upstream, merrily
Smoking on merry green leaves
It's like..
You might also likeShe said its ok
Pardon, spark something up, tap the hunger
Reflect when I was younger, didn't have to spark nothin up
I wonder what it was that had me puffing blunts
Coughing my blood and guts up for a fucking buzz
Buggin out on the biz right when I got a buzz
Seeing God on green, they putting trust in bucks
Fuck the stress that comes with success
I was always depressed, the press was like "fuck is up?"
I said nothing much, beside gas
She said yeah, plus the sunshine bask
Started fasting on life, peepin' subtle stuff
I gave a bum a buck, watch the kids double dutch
Bus stop Pop's and train trips to Mama's
With books droppin' knowledge on lies that once covered us
Like we ain't land on Plymouth Rock, God summoned us
Block Smugglers rise up from under the blue skies
Sunshine, what a day to take a walk in the rain
Wash the thoughts on your brain dry
Get lost for a change, was hittin' up Co$$ for some Jane
Just to cope with my lame life
Putting rings on queens that I wouldn't wife
Pushing dreams on fiends with this wooden mic
And it seems so extreme to be free
So I just adjusted to being me
Truly..
On that new height, talking like I grew like seven inches
Great vision, I make predictions on the state of spittin
Wack rappers will remain gettin a gang of riches, and lame bitches
I'm in the game lane switching, already late bruh
Got no time to hit the brakes or the switches
Blaze off J's and the Swishers
Tobacco's for wack folks, yo, my black hope used to whisper
Shit, time was all up in my face
Godless, John bitchin', my mom wishing
I stick with all the Christians
Sometimes I go to church, talk some sense up at the alter
We all fall victim to systems
Mine and this business, figures and interviews
No time for interludes
Screwed up, can't even use a buck without feeling like a jerk
For what it's worth, I almost blew up, but
I heard y'all, had to kick back, wipe my shirt off
Was on my shit so tough I could've jerked off
The old head said watch the cursing
Losing work cause I'm thinking about my first job: serving
God every morning
Thinking about my friends as the Earth spins
As we worship warships on the spiritual war tip
Y'all listen, we all up in this
4 fitted joint with the forces
Don't forget y'all have a mission, take it
To get up in this, you gotta break through the laws of physics
Simple as arithmetics
Twist wisdom
