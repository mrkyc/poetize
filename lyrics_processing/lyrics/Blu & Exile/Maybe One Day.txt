Yeah, you know, business as usu'
You know, whole lot of unofficial shit to do
I handle stress and shit blues to whoever's amused
And spit truth til it lit up the booth
I'm like the kid with the chipped tooth split with Bishop in Juice
Or like Don Juan Bishop how I'm flipping the truth
I pity them fools, swooping through the city in jewels
Rented is use, in it for them Benjamins too
And so am I but why would I use it on fool's gold
When you know your true soul shines, foolio?
You didn't know, nobody told you better
Nobody ever told you you could be somebody ever?
Nobody ever said it would be easy but jeez
I dream of the pipes, scheming nightly on American creams
Still nobody believes, tryna get a free piece of these
These dreams we sell to these fiends
And jail to these things, this bling bling
Sour cream on top of everything
You would never think that we needed sour cream
Like I don't know how I'm lean 'cause I love sour cream
Give me cheese, give me green, bread is all we need
Head is all I need, we've bled for all of these
Things and I think I'm a in a dream boat, floating upstream
Merrily, smoking on mary green leaves

And maybe one day, he will
Reign supreme and become a king
And one day, maybe she will
Rise again and become a queen

Park, spark something up, top the hunger
Reflect when I was young and didn't have to spark nothing up
Yeah, I wonder what it was that had me puffing blunts
Coughing my blood and guts up for a fucking buzz
Bugging out on the biz right when I got a buzz
Seeing God on green, they putting trust in bucks
Fuck the stress that comes with success
I was always depressed, the press was like, "Fuck is up?"
I said, "Nothing much, besides gas"
She said, "Yeah, plus the sunshine, bask"
Started fasting on life, peeping subtle stuff
I gave a bum a buck, watched the kids double dutch
Bus stop hops and train trips to Mama's
With books dropping knowledge on lies that once covered us
Like we ain't land on Plymouth Rock, God summoned us
Block smugglers rise up from under the blue skies
Sunshine, what a day to take a walk in the rain
Wash the thoughts on your brain dry
Get lost for a change
Was hitting up Co$$ for some Jane just to cope with my lame life
Putting rings on queens that I wouldn't wife
Pushing dreams on fiends with this wooden mic
And it seemed so extreme to be free
So I just adjusted to being me, truly
And maybe one day, he will
Reign supreme and become a king
And one day, maybe she will
Rise again and become a queen

Yeah, on that new hype, talking like I grew like seven inches
Yeah, green vision
I make predictions on the state of spitting
Wack rappers will remain getting
A gang or riches and lame bitches
I'm in the game lane switching
Already late bruh, got no time to hit the brakes or the switches
Blazed off J's and the Swishers
Tobacco's for wack folk though, my Black hope used to whisper
Time was all up in my face, God listened
John bitching, my mom wishing
I stick with all the Christians, sometimes I go to church and
Toss my sins up at the altar, we all fall victim to systems
Minding this business, figures in interviews
No time for interlude, shit screwed up
Can't even use a buck without feeling like a jerk
For what it's worth, I almost blew up but
I heard y'all, had to kick back, wipe my shirk off
Was on my dick so tough, I could've jerked off
The old heads said watch the cursing
Losing work 'cause I'm thinking 'bout my first job serving
God every murnin', mourning over urns
With a burnt feeling thinking 'bout my friends as the Earth spins
As we worship warships
On a spiritual war-tip, y'all listen, we all up in this
Four fitted joint with the forces
Don't forget y'all admission ticket
To get up in this, you gotta break through the laws of physics
Simple as arithmetics, twist wisdom and get lifted
