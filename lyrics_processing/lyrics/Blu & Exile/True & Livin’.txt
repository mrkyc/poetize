Huh, the true and living, what?
The true and living, huh? The true and living, what?
Yo it's the truth y'all, yo it's the truth
Yo it's the truth y'all, yo it's the truth, huh
The true and living, huh? The true and living, what?
The true and living, huh? The true and living, what?
Yo it's the truth y'all, yo it's the truth, say it again
It's the truth y'all, yo it's the truth, ayy, the true and living

Yo, check it
Something you call spectacular, out of this freaking world
The most common denominator between boy and girl
The highest set of standards that's ever been established
Redistribute it to the masses for your satisfaction
We only come in peace to preach about the next coming
The first Black president, what if the next is woman?
This is for those becoming who you intend to be
Pull off your suits and struggle and wash your sins in sea
This is finna be even deeper than a sunken ship
Two thousand plus leagues underground above the rich
And you can see 'em like they hands stretching out to God
And we can save 'em like any patient about to die
This is that big hurt that put a hurting on the truth
They never thought a wish could lead the world, it took pursuit
Life, liberty, happiness to be detached from evil
This is a message to and from the people
The true and living

Uh, turntables and a classic record, a match made in heaven
Glory be to God, straight out the West
It's never been a more truthful duo in these courageous ages
The new creator's favorites, yo, it's Blu and Ex'
Go get a stack of rappers and play us back to back
Check the conclusion after, who got the masses locked?
Open your hearts and let us walk throughout your mental fortress
Close down your chart soon as we spark 'cause you consent to forfeit
Bring back original rap to what it's meant to be
And let that digital relax, wax is slippery
When wet, acapella let me spit on ya decks
Play that intro instrumental, watch the realest connect
To say it simple, yo we simply the best, profess the spiritual
Confess the miracle as individuals and get respect
The next logical step would be to bless the streets
In attempts to reflect what we have yet to see
Ladies and gentlemen, from this dimension
Comes the true and living 90 billion miles from the root of existence
Touch the sun and let me shine like one
Bust ya gun and watch the blind run, we change the shooter's vision
Influential intuitions, intermissions on a mission at the finish
Telling 'em, that we just beginning
From out the park, dropping jewels in the dark
Comes a beat beating harder than the beat of ya heart
The true and living

Yo it's the truth y'all, yo it's the truth, say it again
It's the truth y'all, yo it's the truth, ayy, the true and living

Ayo, back for the third time, reflecting like the Earth shines
A testament to worst times, word to the wise
Visualize your favorite way to make it, call it your place in heaven
Elope the truth and spit a jewel at 80 verbs per second
You can never measure records with the few who did it
Where all the people try and lie and take the future with it
Computer wizards multiplying and division
Subtraction and addition oughta get, the true and living, haha

The true and living, huh? The true and living, what?
The true and living, huh? The true and living, what?
Yo it's the truth y'all, yo it's the truth, say it again
