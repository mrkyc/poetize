It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood
A beautiful day for a neighbor
Would you be mine?

Good morning sunshine, I mean the sunset
I woke up hella late and still ain't wanna yet
I'd rather have a dream of some story set
In some gorgeous place, stuck in your gorgeous nests
Having morning sex but I woke up alone
So I went back to sleep, me and my morning bone
Would have been on and on, probably from dusk to dawn
Instead I'm rusting chrome, busting poems, trusting no one
Living like a gnome, posted at the home
Half asleep and stoned, chop the beats until I'm gone
Chop this already, must have been on my dome
Can't get her off my mind or on the phone half the time
But still I had to try to satisfy this appetite
Might even grab a pie, mad high, bagged eyes
I was that happy guy, taking naps at five
Working early days, leaving smashed in half the night
Baddest like Gladys and the Pips
Gorgeous in the simp and the glorious tilt
'Til somebody spilt milk, but yo, you still chill
I started bugging out like, "Who the fuck spilled milk?"
Knowing damn well it must've been my dumb ass
Now I'm drunk, passed out, having dreams about my love past
Had brunch ass, lunch ass, dinner ass
But never in the ass and never did ask
I just slid past, back to the sunshine
Smacking that behind, mind stuck on rewind
Like hold up, this is fresh, ain't met a woman fresher
Much better than the rest, and may I add the best
Perfectly round ass, perfectly round breasts
Purposely frownless, smile like a ad from crest
And oh yeah, I got a, I got a request
Please say yes
