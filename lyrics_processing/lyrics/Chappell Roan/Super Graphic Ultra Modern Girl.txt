You know what they say
"Never waste a Friday night on a first date"
But there I was
In my heels with my hair straight
And so, I take him to this bar
This man wouldn't dance
He didn't ask a single question
And he was wearing these fugly jeans (Ew)
It doesn't matter though
He doesn't have what it takes to be
With a girl like me

Not overdramatic
I know what I want
We're leaving the planet
And you can't come

Uh-huh, I'm through
With all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need
A super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk, wow
Look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Oh yeah, I need
A super graphic ultra modern girl like me

Telling secrets there on the mattress
Wearing nothing but glitter and lashes
At every party we're the party, shaking our asses
Making out while the world collapses

Not overdramatic
I know what I want
We're leaving the planet
And you can't come

Uh-huh, I'm through
With all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need
A super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk, wow
Look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Oh yeah, I need
A super graphic ultra modern girl like me (Shake it for me)

Get up off your feet
Get up on that bar
Walk that walk
From Tokyo to New York
With everything you feel
And everything you are
Walk that walk
Flash the camera
Flash the camera
Flash the camera
You're a star
Uh-huh, I'm through
With all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need
A super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk, wow
Look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Oh yeah, I need
A super graphic ultra modern
Oh, you got me, "La-la-la"-in'
