We broke up on a Tuesday
Kicked me out with the rent paid
Ruined my credit, stole my cute aesthetic
Who knew that we'd let it
Get this bad when it ended

It's comical, bridges you burn
Karma's real, hope it's your turn
I heard from Katie
You're losing it lately
Moved back with your parents
And date girls who're eighteen

It's hot when you have a meltdown
In the front of your house and you're getting kicked out
It's hot when you're drinking downtown
And you're getting called out 'cause you're running your mouth
Oh, God
And it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around
Oh, God, oh, God
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching

You ruining your life
You losing your mind
You dyeing your hair
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching
You crashing your car
You breaking your heart
You thinking I care
People say I'm jealous but my kink is karma

Wishing you the best, in the worst way
Using your distress as foreplay
Six months since April and I'm doing better
No need to be hateful in your fake Gucci sweater

But it's hot when you have a meltdown
In the front of your house and you're getting kicked out
It's hot when you're drinking downtown
And you're getting called out 'cause you're running your mouth
Oh, God
And it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around
Oh, God, oh, God
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching

You ruining your life
You losing your mind
You dyeing your hair
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching
You crashing your car
You breaking your heart
You thinking I care
People say I'm jealous but my kink is karma
It's hot when you're going through hell
And you're hating yourself, I'm feeling myself
It's hot when you know that you're caught
And you're getting pissed off, it's getting me off
It's hot, it's hot
Oh, God, oh, God
Oh, God
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching

You ruining your life
You losing your mind
You dyeing your hair
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching
You crashing your car
You breaking your heart
