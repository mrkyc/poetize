Hi, it's Chappell, I know you just landed
And I know you're probably busy but
I would love to see you
So call me when you can

New crush, high school love again
The rush of slumber party kissing
Don't touch, I'll never cross the line
So I pushed you down a million times
I'd love if you knew you were on my mind
Constant like cicadas in the summertime
Boys suck and girls I've never tried
And we both know we're getting drunk tonight

Touch me, baby, put your lips on mine
Could go to hell but we'll probably be fine
I know you want it, baby, you can have it
Oh, I've never done it, let's make it cinematic
Like that one sex scene that's in Mulholland Drive
I wanna know, baby, what is it like?
I know you want it, baby, you can have it
Oh, I've never done it, naked in Manhattan

A Pisces who knew that we were so aligned
When I sing that Lana song, it makes you cry
Mean Girls, we watch it every night
And we both have a crush on Regina George
You love peach and ice cream
Bedazzled, Chanel rings
In New York, you can try things
An inch away from more than just friends

Touch me, baby, put your lips on mine
Could go to hell but we'll probably be fine
I know you want it, baby, you can have it
Oh, I've never done it, naked in Manhattan

Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)
Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)
Hair clips and lip gloss
French kiss sitting criss-cross
If I don't try, then it's my loss
An inch away from more than just friends

Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)
Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)

Won't you fucking touch me?
I just want to touch you (Naked in Manhattan)
I want all of your love (Naked in Manhattan)
Oh, oh, oh (Naked in Manhattan)
