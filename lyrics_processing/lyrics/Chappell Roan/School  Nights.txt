I'm feeling childish
When you draw tattoos on my forearm
Pop bubblegum too loud
We got them preachin' that we're hell-bound

But I don't think we are unless you do

I wanna be a kid with you
Talk slow on a school night
And you can disregard my virgin ears and say what you like
You wanna win me over now?
Impress me like a school fight
And I triple-dog dare ya
To pinky-promise that you'll never lie
Ooh ooh oh

We light firecrackers in the middle of the street
You hear them yellin' at us
But you, listen to me
As I pour my voice in your soul
You say "goddamn let's never get old," and
I agree

I wanna be a kid with you
Talk slow on a school night
And you can disregard my virgin ears and say what you like
You wanna win me over now?
Impress me like a school fight
And I triple-dog dare ya
To pinky-promise that you'll never lie
Ooh ooh oh

Make me a ring out of clover flowers
Sit in a teacup, spin for hours
I'm official, I know I'm official
Got a badge to your club and
One has initials
You become King Kong
You're King Kong
You grow up so strong
You're so strong
But I wannna stay young
Yeah, I wanna stay young with you
Yeah, I wanna stay young
Yeah, I wanna stay young with you
Wanna stay young
I wanna stay young with you
Wanna stay young
I wanna stay young
I wanna be a kid with you
Talk slow on a school night
And you can disregard my virgin ears and say what you like
You want to win me over now?
Impress me like a school fight
And I triple-dog dare ya
To pinky-promise that you'll never lie
