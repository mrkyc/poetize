Oh God, tell me that I'm not insane
With a toy gun hanging in my mouth
I'm made of jade and I'm feeling pretty jaded
It's a problem that I'll never ever figure out
Take pills for your double black eyes
Said I pack a punch and give it to ya
Don't promise you'll do better next time
I know never to believe ya

I love being bitter
It makes me feel better
Bitter feels better than tryna get better and I
Yes, I love being bitter
But it makes me feel weathered
Now I'm sick in the head and it's not even my fault
Now I'm sick in the head and it's not even my fault

I used to laugh like the cartoon children
I wasn't always this way
Once sweet like an orange creamsicle
Or lemon icing on the cake

I know exactly what you want
Cut clean when I twist that knife
No one falls for the villain

But I love being bitter
Yeah, it makes me feel better
Bitter feels better than tryna get better and I
Yes, I love being bitter
But it makes me feel weathered
Now I'm sick in the head and it's not even my fault
Now I'm sick in the head and it's not even my fault

I'm unaware just give me some time, I'm
Having trouble fighting wars in my mind
Take it easy, take it easy
I don't care that I'm on your shelf 'cause
I'm pretty good at talking to myself
Take it easy, take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy
Yes, I love being bitter
'Cause it makes me feel better
Now I'm sick in the head and I think it's my fault
