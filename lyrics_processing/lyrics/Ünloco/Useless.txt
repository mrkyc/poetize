I'm lying on the bed
Cause outside is just too cold
I turn the radio loud
So I can fall asleep
But it's all I've come to know
Push me and you shoved
Like you always do
But nothing's ever the same
But how can I explain
The damage you have done
When all that's left is pain?
So I tried to stay awake
And so I would try to stay awake
And so I learned...
Waiting in my room
I'm lying on the bed
Cause outside is just too warm
I turn the radio loud
So I can fall asleep
But it's all I've come to know
So I tried to stay awake
And so I would try to stay awake
And so I learned...
You might also likeI fucking tried your way
And I don't like what I see 'cause I've been
Put to the test and faced all the rest
And useless is all I'll be
I tried your way
And I don't like what I see and now I'm bored
I'm Waiting in my room
I'm lying on the floor
Cause outside I just don't know
I turned the radio loud
So I can hear me think
But it's all I've come to know
And so I tried to stay awake
And so I would try to stay awake
And so I learned...
I fucking tried your way
And I don't like what I see 'cause I've been
Put to the test and faced all the rest
And useless is all I'll be
I tried your way
And I don't like what I see and now I'm bored
And now I'm bored
So I burn a part of me
That slowly fades to you
But how can I plainly see
What slowly fades to me?!
And so I tried to stay awake
And so I would try to stay awake
And so I learned...
I fucking tried your way
And I don't like what I see 'cause I've been
Put to the test and faced all the rest
And useless is all I'll be
I tried your way
And I don't like what I see and now I'm bored
