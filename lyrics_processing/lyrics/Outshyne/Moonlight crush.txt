Maybe it's just the summer time heat
That's got my heart playing tricks on me
With a couple of beers and a good-time atmosphere
Or maybe it's the way you tilt your head
And when you laugh at some silly thing I said
Or your angel eyes, whatever it is tonight

I've got a little moonlight crush
On you girl, a little bit starstruck
Having a hard time covering up
How I'm feeling right now
Your pretty firefly silhouettes
Looking just about as good as it gets
You're such a beautiful little wreck
The way you're smiling at me
Yeah, it might be love
Or just a little moonlight crush

I'm hoping by the way you took my hand
Means you want to drift off from the crowd and the band
To somewhere else, all by ourselves
And let our kisses tell us what we got
And you can tell me what you want this night to be
Cause at the very least
You might also like
I've got a little moonlight crush
On you girl, a little bit starstruck
Having a hard time covering up
How I'm feeling right now
Your pretty firefly silhouettes
Looking just about as good as it gets
You're such a beautiful little wreck
The way you're smiling at me
Yeah, it might be love
Or just a little moonlight crush

That strap hanging off your shoulder
I can't help but get a little bit closer
I'd like to do this over, and over, and over

I've got a little moonlight crush
On you girl, a little bit starstruck
Having a hard time covering up
How I'm feeling right now
Your pretty firefly silhouettes
Looking just about as good as it gets
You're such a beautiful little wreck
The way you're smiling at me
Yeah, it might be love
Or just a little moonlight crush
Just a little moonlight crush
