She ain't never lived in the country
She's and uptown ball gown kind of girl
But there's somethin about the country
That she loves
She dont like those preppy boys
With spiked hair and collared shirts on
She like boots and jeans and the way I say hey yall
Our friends say that were like oil and water
But we mix like sugar and tea
She can't help it, she can't help it

She dont like those preppy boys
With spiked hair and collared shirts on
She likes boots and jeans and the way i say hey yall
Our friends say that were like oil and water
But we mix like sugar and tea
She can't help it, she can't help it
She likes the country boy in me
But every friday night we go ridin in my truck
She likes to take the dirt road
Play in the mud
She reaches for the radio
Yeah she turns it up
She loves that country stuff
But she dont like those preppy boys
With spiked hair and collared shirts on
She likes my dirty old pickup truck
And my liberty overall
And our friends say that were like oil and water
But we mix like sugar and tea
She can't help it, she can't help it
