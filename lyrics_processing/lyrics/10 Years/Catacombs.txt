Make us a new muse (make us a new muse)
Our golden gods are old news
Dig up those old bones
These new clones have no
Rhythm or soul (rhythm or soul)
Rhythm or soul

Tripping on the heels of kings and queens
Fed cheap thrills and shiny things
Do we want them, why do we want them?

Don't stop, it won't stop
Don't stop, it won't stop
(We don't want this)
Don't stop, it won't stop
Don't stop, it won't stop

Rewrite us new rules (rewrite us new rules)
When all the laws have been abused
Repeat history like a dead language mystery
We can't read (we can't read)
We can't read

Keep us comatose so no one knows
Do we want them, why do we want them?

Don't stop, it won't stop
Don't stop, it won't stop

Don't stop, it won't stop
Don't stop, it won't stop
