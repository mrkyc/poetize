In your eyes, is the picture perfect?
In your eyes, does the grass look greener?
Have you seen it through my eyes?

The world has caught on fire
From what I've been told
These city lights are killing ever slowly
The sanity within me
Maybe I'm lost in my creation
This isn't how I thought I'd turn out

In your eyes, I'm picture perfect
In your eyes, the grass is greener
Have you seen it through my eyes?
('Cause through my eyes)

Stars are burning brighter
So bright we can't ignore
We're hypnotized by televised train wrecks
Tragedy's a paycheck
Maybe I'm a product of my placement
We're given no time to make up our minds

In your eyes, I'm picture perfect
In your eyes, the grass is greener
Have you seen it through my eyes?
('Cause through my eyes)

In your eyes, I'm so picture perfect
In your eyes, the grass is greener
Have you seen it through my eyes?

Through my eyes
Through my eyes
Through my eyes

Pay attention please
He who lusts through life for excess in this world
Dies a lonely man, careless of his soul
Throwing caution to the wind with foolish ignorance
You're full of pride
And in arrogance you can't accept the nearing end of this short lived life
Smile and give a toast, brag and boast
Fool the world with all of your lies
The parasite's host never even knows
Pull the wool over our eyes
Walk the line and pay the price
A pound of flesh for paradise
Wear the wounds of your demise
Fail to mention your intentions, fail to mention why
The actions of your life contradict your words...
The path in which you walk is a vice of no remorse
Washing conscience from the skin, claiming innocence
Ignore the signs
From cradle to grave, you chose to trade
A pound of flesh for paradise
