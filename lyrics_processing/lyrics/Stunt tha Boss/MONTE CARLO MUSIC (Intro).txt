Im not a athelete but got the baddiest hoes after me
Im riding stock baby everything factory
Every morning its the same goal
I check the stop light i hit the shift kit now watch that thing roll
454 u can hear it holling im trying to hold my balance
Just bought a newer pair of ralleys
Switching lanes like im on the strip pu**y ni**as running lips
Uhh but scared to race me for there slips
How it feel when you spin the wheels white smocking
Fish tailing out the gate got it wide open
See im riding like a boss suppose to you in that 2.0.13
Im in this 77 that a toast you
Plus im burning out the gas tank i drop my ni**a off
He had some killer in the ashtray
Im riding illegal with this sh*t tucked if you ain't pushing 500 horses
Then you need to hush  (hush ni**a)

Im not a rock star but i be vibing like it
This not a race car but i be driving like it
See the streets love me cuz they know i bring the good
Holley carburetor chrome steel up under the hood
You can hear me bend the corner on you (I got a)
Ashtray full of stank thats that marijuana
I dont even burn but you can check the indy tires
On this mutherfuc*a when i turn
Now ain't that bi*ch a bastard i swing through your corners
Ni**a like dukes a hazard ("with my hazards")
They be asking where i been like im casper until i drop the top
On that thing then its plasma
You can see me when im coming you can hear the bass thumping
Hop out the car and leave the streets rumbling
Everybody knows my main goal i pimp slick quick
Hard on your chick thats how the game goes
