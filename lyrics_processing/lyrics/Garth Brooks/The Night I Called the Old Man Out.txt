The dining room fell silent, I can't believe what I just said
I just told my dad he's full of it and I watched his face turn red
Well, and I should've said, "I'm sorry", but I matched him shout for shout
An' I can still hear that screen door slammin', the night I called him out

And he said, "Son, it's gonna hurt me, more than it hurts you"
But somehow I couldn't help but have my doubts
'Cause I'd seen my older brothers crawl back in the house
Each time they called the old man out

Fist to fist and eye to eye, standin' toe to toe
He would've let me walk away, but I just would not let it go
Years of my frustration had led me to this night
Now he'll pay for all the times that he's been right

And he said, "Son, it's gonna hurt me, more than it hurts you"
But somehow I couldn't help but have my doubts
'Cause I'd seen my older brothers crawl back in the house
Each time they called the old man out

It was over in a minute and that's when I realized
The blood came from my mouth and nose, but the tears came from his eyes
And in memory of that fateful night, I know the greatest pain was his
And I just pray someday I'm half the man he is

And he said, "Son, it's gonna hurt me, more than it hurts you"
But somehow I couldn't help but have my doubts
'Cause I'd seen my older brothers crawl back in the house
Each time they called the old man out

Just like my older brothers, I crawled back in the house
