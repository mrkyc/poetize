You're stubborn as they come, you'll never settle down
You'll always be the one who doesn't stick around
You make all the rules, you're set in your ways
You gotta have your freedom, you gotta have your space

But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feelin' things you never felt and spendin' all your time
Tryin' to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start buildin' up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

Go on and shake your head and tell me that I'm wrong
Say I'm just another fool and this is just another song
But I know how you are, 'cause I know how I am
And I'd give anything to go back and try again

But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feelin' things you never felt and spendin' all your time
Tryin' to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start buildin' up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

And you best put this song on repeat
Maybe then you won't end up like me

But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feelin' things you never felt and spendin' all your time
Tryin' to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start buildin' up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
