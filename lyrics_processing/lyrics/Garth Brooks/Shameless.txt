Well, I'm shameless, when it comes to lovin' you
I'll do anything you want me to, I'll do anything at all
And I'm standin', here for all the world to see
Oh, baby, that's what's left of me, don't have very far to fall

You know, now, I'm not a man who's ever been
Insecure about the world I've been livin' in
I don't break easy, I have my pride
But if you need to be satisfied

I'm shameless, oh, honey I don't have a prayer
Every time I see you standin' there, I go down upon my knees
And I'm changin', swore I'd never compromise
Oh, but you convinced me otherwise, I'll do anything you please

You see in all my life I've never found
What I couldn't resist, what I couldn't turn down
I can walk away from anyone I ever knew
But I can't walk away from you

I have never let anything have this much control over me
I worked too hard to call my life my own
And I've made myself a world and it's worked so perfectly
But it's your world now, I can't refuse, I've never had so much to lose
Oh, I'm shameless

You know it should be easy for a man who's strong
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong
I've never lost anything I've ever missed
But I've never been in love like this
It's out of my hands

I'm shameless, I don't have the power now
I don't want it anyhow, so I gotta let it go
Oh, I'm shameless, shameless as a man can be
You could make a total fool of me, I just wanted to you to know

Oh, I'm shameless
I just wanted you to know
Oh, I'm shameless
