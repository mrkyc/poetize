Blame it all on my roots, I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know, the last one to show
I was the last one you thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise, and the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you, said, "Honey, we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain"

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away
And I'll be okay
Yeah I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends, in low places

Well, I guess I was wrong, I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's alright, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean, to cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well I'll be as high as that ivory tower
That you're livin' in

I didn't mean to cause a big scene
Just wait 'til I finish this glass
Then sweet little lady I'll head back to the bar
And you can kiss my ass

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away, and I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
