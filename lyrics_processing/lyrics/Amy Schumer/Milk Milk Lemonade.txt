I used to think that my tits was where it's at
Used to be concerned that my booty was too fat
But now I know the truth and that worry has been shot
Big booty's what they want and big booty's what I got

Milk, milk, lemonade
Milk, milk, lemonade
Milk, milk, lemonade

Tits are old news if you know what I mean
All the guys love my fudge machine
Look me in the eye, get your face in, don't be shy
You say you don't like asses 'cause I fart and break your glasses

On my booty empire, the sun never set
Take a shot, yeah, nothin' but net
Milk, milk, lemonade

I'm gonna make you scream and shout
For the part of my body where poo comes out

This is where my poo comes out
This is where my poo comes out
This is where my poo comes out
This is where my poo comes out
Talkin' 'bout my fudge machine
Talkin' 'bout my fudge machine
Talkin' 'bout my fudge machine

That's right, ladies
Ain't nothing better than a big, beautiful sexy booty
But bottom line, no matter how fine a behind
You better call that onion what it really is
That's just a fudge machine
Turn up
