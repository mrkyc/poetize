Is everything broken
If I could take it back?
Even for a moment
Because some nights I want that
Should I call you
I could try to explain
But I'll just make the same mistake

So I'll just lie here
Lock away these words
Just keep them inside me
If you only knew how much it hurts
But if I'm honest
In the cold light of day
I'll be okay
More than okay

If it's falling, let it fall

I love that you gave my heart a home
The place hasn't changed but I'm here alone
I know it's crazy walking wires
But nothing lasts forever
When it all falls down, gotta build it better
This bed feels five miles wide
Beginning to dread these lonely nights
I know it's crazy walking wires
But nothing lasts forever
When it all falls down, gotta build it better
You might also like
I'll take down the pictures
Read your letters one last time
Trying not to remember
All the good times at the start
It's never easy
When things don't last
And it's hard for my heart
When I'm alone here in the dark

But if it's breaking, let it break

I love that you gave my heart a home
The place hasn't changed, been here alone
I know it's crazy walking wires
But nothing lasts forever
When it all falls down, gotta build it better
This bed feels five miles wide
Beginning to dread these lonely nights
I know it's crazy walking wires
But nothing lasts forever
When it all falls down, gotta build it better

Let it fall down
Let it fall down then build it better
Let it fall down
Let it fall down then build it better
Let it fall down
Let it fall down then build it better
Let it fall down
Let it fall down
I love that you gave my heart a home
The place hasn't changed, but I'm here alone
I know it's crazy walking wires
But nothing lasts forever
When it all falls down, gotta build it better
This bed feels five miles wide
Beginning to dread these lonely nights
I know it's crazy walking wires
But nothing lasts forever
