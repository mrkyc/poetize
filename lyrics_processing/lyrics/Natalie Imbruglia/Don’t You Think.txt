Ignore reality
There's nothing you can do about it

Some people
Don't worry
'Bout nothing
Don't know what's going on
I'm not one
Who can't say they're sorry
I just care what's going on

There's more important things
Than making sure your watch look just right
And second hand opinions
Don't make you look any smarter

Don't you think
Don't you think
Don't you think that maybe it's time, yes it's time
Time you started thinking
Time you started thinking
Time you started thinking
Time you started thinking
And don't just sweeten up the taste
You might also like
Brother shoots brother
But meanwhile you're fixing up your face
You're not affected by the truth
Unless it's on your doorstep
Deodorize your paradise
No point in getting crazy

Don't you think
Don't you think
Don't you think that maybe it's time, yes it's time

Time you started thinking 'bout things in the back of your head
Someone said before you turn a blind eye
Hear a bell ring sex sells everything
But I don't buy it so don't try it
Sleeping in the small world head in the sand
Better wash your hands, make a new plan
There's more important things
Than making sure your shoes walk just right
Ignore reality, there's nothing you can do about it
Ignore reality, there's nothing you can do about it
Ignore reality, there's nothing you can do about it
The clothes you wear don't make the man
It's just another party
Don't you think
Don't you think
Don't you think that maybe it's time
Don't you think
Don't you think
Don't you think that maybe it's time
Time you started thinking

There are more important things
Than making sure your watch looks just right
Your second hand opinions
Don't make you look any smarter

You're not affected by the truth
Unless it's on your doorstep
Deodorize your paradise
No point in getting crazy
Yes, its time
Time you started thinking
Time you started thinking
Time you started thinking
