All night been staring into headlights
Thinking 'bout what I left behind
I don't need it no more
All my life people telling me what's right
This time I draw my own lines
I've never been so sure

You got me feeling a whole lot better
I found a way to fly above the weather
Thirty thousand feet up here I can see
Oh, just how it's supposed to be

Now I know what it feels like
Thinking I could be ready to give up the fight
Now I know what it feels like
To love somebody like I love you
Now I know what it feels like
Thinking I could be ready to give up the fight
Now I know what it feels like
To love somebody like I love you

Lately doesn't feel like I'm waiting
Such a colourful daydream
Just this, nothing more
Hmm, there is so much I wanna say
Words don't come out but you see my face
You know like I know, I've never been so sure
You might also like
Now I know what it feels like
Thinking I could be ready to give up the fight
Now I know what it feels like
To love somebody like I love you
Now I know what it feels like
Thinking I could be ready to give up the fight
Now I know what it feels like
To love somebody like I love you

(Like I love you)
(Like I love you)
To love somebody like I love you
(Like I love you)
(Like I love you)
(Like I love you)
To love somebody like I love you

Now I know what it feels like
Thinking I could be ready to give up the fight
Now I know what it feels like
To love somebody like I love you
Now I know what it feels like
Thinking I could be ready to give up the fight
Now I know what it feels like
To love somebody like I love you
(Like I love you)
There is so much I wanna say
(Like I love you)
Words don't come out but you see my face
(Like I love you)
You know like I know
You know like I know
(Like I love you)
