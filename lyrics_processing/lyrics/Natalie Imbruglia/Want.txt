A round of applause, you've got what you want
Take a good look at what you give up
Because I'm telling you a heart can't be unbroken
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
And can you remember how I kiss you
Recall the sweet taste in your mouth
'Cause baby, the memory is all you get now
And I'm movin', movin', movin' on

All that you want
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
'Cause I didn't
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
'Cause I didn't

Does every morning make you happy?
And tell me, do you laugh yourself to sleep?
I hope you find it easy to forget me
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I hope you don't feel anything when you see me
I wonder if you're out there having fun
I hope you get all that you really wanted
'Cause I'm movin', movin', movin' on
You might also like
Don't you see the light has changed
And nothing looks the same?
Just shadows on the ground
And if you listen carefully you'll hear the sound

All that you want
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
'Cause I didn't (All that you want)
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
'Cause I didn't (All that you want)
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
I hope you get all that you want
'Cause I didn't (All that you want)
'Cause I didn't

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (All that you want)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (All that you want)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (All that you want)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (All that you want)
(All that you want)
(All that you want)
(All that you want)
('Cause I)
(All that you want)
(All that you want)
