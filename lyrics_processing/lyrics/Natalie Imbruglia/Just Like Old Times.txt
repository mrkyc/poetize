I didn't see it coming, yeah
I know it's kind of out of the blue
It's four in the morning
And I'm talking to you
I'm trying to slow the river
But the memories are flooding in
And maybe I'm drowning
Maybe I'll swim

It's been a long time
And I know we're doing fine
But I was wondering if you're happy
And if I'm ever on your mind
Cause it's been so many nights
In too many crowded rooms
Lost in a drink, talking to strangers
Just wishing they were you
Just me and you
Just like old times
It's always been you
Just me and you
Just like old times

Walking round the city
And I'm taking in the places we've been
Looks different in daylight
But it's a wonderful thing
Reading through the letters
That you wrote me for the first time in years
I couldn't help thinking
Was this something I missed?
You might also like
It's been a long time
And I know we're doing fine
But I was wondering if you're happy
And if I'm ever on your mind
Cause it's been so many nights
In too many crowded rooms
Lost in a drink, talking to strangers
Just wishing they were you
Just me and you
Just like old times
It's always been you
Just me and you
Just like old times

I'm not saying it is your fault
It's been a lifetime building walls
And I'm just trying to find a way
To make peace with myself
With myself

It's been a long time
And I know we're doing fine
But I was wondering if you're happy
And if I'm ever on your mind
Cause it's been so many nights
In too many crowded rooms
Lost in a drink, talking to strangers
Just wishing they were you
Just me and you
Just like old times
It's always been you
Just me and you
