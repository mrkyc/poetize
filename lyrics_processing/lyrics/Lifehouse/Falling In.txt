Every time I see your face
My heart takes off on a high speed chase
Now don't be scared, it's only love
Baby, that we're falling in

I can't wait 'til tomorrow
This feeling has swallowed me whole
And I know that I've lost control
This heart that I have followed
Has left me so hollow
That was then, this is now
Yeah, you have changed everything

Every time I see your face
My heart takes off on a high speed chase
Now don't be scared, it's only love
That we're falling in

I would never do you wrong
Or let you down or lead you on
Don't look down, it's only love
Baby, that we're falling in
You might also like
I'm standing in your driveway
It's midnight and I'm sideways
I have to find out if you feel the same
Won't be easy, have my doubts too
But it's over without you
I'm just lost, incomplete
Yeah, you feel like home
Home to me

Every time I see your face
My heart takes off on a high speed chase
Now don't be scared, it's only love
That we're falling in

I would never do you wrong
Or let you down or lead you on
Don't look down, it's only love
Baby, that we're falling in, falling in

All those nights I stayed awake
Thinking of all the ways to make you mine
All of those smiles will never fade
Never run out of ways to blow my mind
Every time I see your face
My heart takes off on a high speed chase
Now don't be scared, it's only love
That we're falling in

I would never do you wrong
Or let you down or lead you on
Now, don't look down, it's only love
Baby, that we're falling in

Don't be scared, it's only love
