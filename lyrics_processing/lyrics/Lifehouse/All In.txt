All night, staring at the ceiling
Counting for minutes, I'm feeling
This way, so far away and so alone
But you know it's alright, I came to my senses
Let go of my defenses
There's no way I'm giving up this time
Yeah, you know I'm right here
I'm not losing you this time

And I'm all in, nothing left to hide
I've fallen harder than a landslide
I spent a week away from you last night
And now I'm calling, calling out your name
Even if I lose the game
I'm all in, I'm all in tonight
Yeah, I'm all in, I'm all in for life

There's no taking back, what we've got's too strong
We've had each other's back for too long
There's no breaking up this time
And you know it's okay, I came to my senses
Let go of my defenses
There's no way I'm giving up this time
You might also like
And I'm all in, nothing left to hide
I've fallen harder than a landslide
I spent a week away from you last night
And now I'm calling, calling out your name
Even if I lose the game
I'm all in, I'm all in tonight
Yeah, I'm all in, I'm all in for life

I want it, I want it, yeah, I want it
Yeah, I want it, I want it, I want it
Yeah, I want it, I want it, yeah, I want it
Oh, I'm calling, calling out your name
Even if I lose the game
I'm all in, I'm all in for life

And I'm all in, nothing left to hide
I've fallen harder than a landslide
I spent a week away from you last night
And now I'm calling, calling out your name
Even if I lose the game
I'm all in, I'm all in tonight
Yeah, I'm all in, I'm all in for life
Yeah, I'm all in, I'm all in for life
