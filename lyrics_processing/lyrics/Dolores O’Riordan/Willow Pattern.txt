A phase I'm going through
Dreaming of the willow pattern
There's something I should do
I'd never see the world without you
You opened up my eyes
I'd never see the world without you
And now I realise
Never turn around
Never transit / chance it
Never play dead
Don't ever walk backwards
Never turn around
Never transit / chance it
Never play dead
Don't ever walk backwards
You should never take a thing for granted
You only miss it when it's gone
And it's stupid to be holding grudges
Because we only got so long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long

She kept it in her room
An oriental china set
A gift I would assume
She told me how you loved her so much
That everybody died
Another universal theme
Don't hold it all inside
Never turn around
Never transit / chance it
Never play dead
Don't ever walk backwards
Never turn around
Never transit / chance it
Never play dead
Don't ever walk backwards
You should never take a thing for granted
You only miss it when it's gone
And it's stupid to be holding grudges
Because we only got so long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long

I affiliate with you
I affiliate with you
I affiliate with you
I affiliate with you
I affiliate with you
I know we'd all have died
Never turn around
Never transit / chance it
Never play dead
Don't ever walk backwards
Never turn around
Never transit / chance it
Never play dead
Don't ever walk backwards
You should never take a thing for granted
You only miss it when it's gone
And it's stupid to be holding grudges
Because we only got so long
