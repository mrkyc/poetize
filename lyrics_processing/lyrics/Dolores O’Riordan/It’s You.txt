It's you
It's you
You know you make me feel better
And I knew
I knew
I knew
When I was under the weather
Where did it all the time go?
Where did it all the time go?
It's you
It's you
It's you
You know you make me feel better
I remember the time when we were small
Planting seeds, pulling weeds
I remember the time when we were small
We did it all
But tell me where did it all the time go?
Where did it all the time go?
It's you
It's you
It's you
You know you make me feel better

You know you make me feel better
And I knew

I knew
When I was under the weather
Where did it all the time go?
Where did it all the time go?
It's you
It's you
It's you
You know you make me feel better
I remembered driving in the car
Our destiny was never far
I must have asked ten thousand times
"Are we there?"
But tell me where did all the time go?
Where did it all the time go?
It's you
It's you
It's you
You know you make me feel better
I could not wait until I grew
I could not wait until I grew
I could not wait until I grew
I could not wait until I grew
I could not wait until I knew
I could not wait until I knew
I could not wait until I knew
I could not wait until I knew
I would love to go back to that car
Where our destiny was never far
I would love to go back to that car
But I can't
It occurred to me today that made me
I wished those days away
Still It's you
It's you
It's you
You know you make me feel better
Whatever you do
Don't wish your days away
Whatever you do
Take it easy today
