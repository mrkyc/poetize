We stood in the windy city
The gypsy boy and I
We slept on the breeze in the midnight
With the rain droppin' tears in our eyes

And who's goin' to be the one
To say it was no good what we done?
I dare a man to say I'm too young
For I'm goin' to try for the sun

We huddled in a derelict buildin'
And when he thought I was asleep
He laid his poor coat round my shoulder
And shivered there beside me in a heap

And who's goin' to be the one
To say it was no good what we done?
I dare a man to say I'm too young
For I'm goin' to try for the sun

We sang and cracked the sky with laughter
Our breath turned to mist in the cold
Our years put together count to thirty
But our eyes told the dawn we were old
You might also like
And who's goin' to be the one
To say it was no good what we done?
I dare a man to say I'm too young
For I'm goin' to try for the sun


Mirror, mirror, hangin' in the sky
Won't you look down for what's happenin' here below?
I stand here singin' to the flowers
So very few people really know

And who's goin' to be the one
To say it was no good what we done?
I dare a man to say I'm too young
For I'm goin' to try for the sun

We stood in the windy city
The gypsy boy and I
We slept on the breeze in the midnight
With the rain droppin' tears in our eyes
And who's goin' to be the one
To say it was no good what we done?
I dare a man to say I'm too young
