Fine, fine, fine, fine celandine
He prepared for her
Tea, tea, tea, tea to make her free
While incense burned

In love pool eyes
Float feathers after the struggle
The hopes burst and shot joy
All through the mind
Sorrow more distant than a star
Multi-color run down over your body
Then the liquid passing all into all
(Love is hot, love is hot)
Love is hot, truth is molten

True, true, true, true the song he sang her
While the leaves cooked
Ting, ting, tiny little bell he rang her
Sleepily, she looked
He filled, he filled a leather cup
Holding her gaze
She took, she took a little sip
While this song he sang
