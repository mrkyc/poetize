Woke up this morning
Got the saddest feeling in my chest
I don't know where I belong
Ever since you been gone
Don't know what it's telling me
I've got so many different sides
'Cause I know I want to grow
And you're putting such a hold on me

And you know, as time goes
I need to heal, I need to feel
And you'll see
We're not meant to be
Just let it go, just let it go

'Cause it's been way too long
And I'm not, not that strong
I can't, I can't do it, I can't
'Cause I see in your eyes that you're not by my side
Oh whoa
'Cause I'm not good at faking, no
And you know I can't take it
I need love, I need love
You might also like
Don't know where I'm going
Got me feeling so reckless now
But it's time for me to go
And I want to let you know
We have time to make it right
And it's too late
It's done, can't be erase
Can never fill your place

And you know, as time goes
I need to heal I need to feel
And you'll see
We're not meant to be
Just let it go, just let it go

'Cause it's been way too long
And I'm not, not that strong
I can't, I can't do it, I can't
'Cause I see in your eyes that you're not by my side
Oh whoa
'Cause I'm not good at faking, no
And you know I can't take it
I need love, I need love
I know you don't see me the way I see you
We've grown so far apart
I just can't break your heart
You have been so complicated
Accusing me when I'm frustrated
Never told a lie, stayed by your side
While you were getting high
Feeling all alone
When I should've known
Should've been strong
I know it's time to say goodbye
Oh

'Cause it's been way too long
And I'm not, not that strong
I can't, I can't do it, I can't
'Cause I see in your eyes that you're not by my side
Oh whoa
'Cause I'm not good at faking, no
And you know I can't take it
