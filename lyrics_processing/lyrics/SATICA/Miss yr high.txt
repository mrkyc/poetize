Smoked a joint in the blind 
Yeah we where dancing in the dark
Then you pinned me to the wall
I can't forget it
(Can't forget it, can't forget it)
And whenever i'm with you
I only see in pink and blue
I love the dirty shit you do
I don't regret it
(Don't regret it, don't regret it)

I taste you like the summer
You come in waves of colour
Under your influence I fall
I fall

I miss your, I miss your high
I miss your, I miss your high
When you go, when you go, when you go
I get low, I get low, I get low
I miss your, I miss your high

Feel me in the car
Took my clothes off in the dark
In an empty parking lot
In Venice beach
(In Venice beach, in Venice beach)
You pulled me in the flood
But our love was only drunk
Being sober's never fun
When I know you leave
(When I know you leave, when I know you leave)
You might also like
I taste you like the summer
You come in waves of colour
Under your influence I fall
I fall

I miss your, I miss your high
I miss your, I miss your high
When you go, when you go, when you go
I get low, I get low, I get low
I miss your, I miss your high

We've been on a mission, mission
I don't want you come down, come down
We've been on a mission
And I don't want you come down, come down 

I miss your, I miss your high
I miss your, I miss your high
When you go, when you go, when you go
I get low, I get low, I get low
I miss your, I miss your high
(i miss your high)
I miss your high
(i miss your high)
