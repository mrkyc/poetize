I got the scent of your skin lingering up on my neck
Like the smoke from the air, from your fucking cigarette
That you always seem to smoke when your body's nervous
I know that you thinking that you don't deserve this

Why does it feel like we're just dancing now?
Find a way to bring me down to nothing now

Why you come around here with all the messes that you make?
Why you tear it up by cleaning up you know you got me?
Why you come around here with all the messes that you make?
Why you tear it up by cleaning up you know you got me?

Why you come around here?
Don't you come around here
Why you come around here?
Don't you come around here would you

Dysfunctional
Taking what I feel like, never wanna see you go
Dysfunctional
Got the rope around you, but I don't wanna tie you down
Dysfunctional
Please forgive me, I ain't got no sense
Dysfunctional
I can't really love you till I've had my drink
