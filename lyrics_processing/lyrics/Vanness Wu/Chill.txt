When life feels like it's a gamble
Dreaming of a better day
Treasures in a jar of clay
Stay humble
But these animals in the jungle
They all think that I'm the prey
But they just made a big mistake
'Cause I got fire in my heart it ain't going away
Keep on that vibe don't ask why
'Cause I'm here to stay
I took a chance learn to dance
Without shoes in the rain
Guess I'm tryna say heh
We're two of a kind
You gotta smooth out your moves
It's not wrong that I'm right
There's more than just one groove
Y'all just need to chill
True
I don't deserve a girl like you
But you could use a guy like me
To tell you that you look perfect
You might also likeAnd we don't always gotta fight
Don't matter if you are wrong or right
You're still my favorite person
We got life in our hearts it ain't going away
Keep on that vibe don't ask why
'Cause we're here to stay
We took a chance learn to dance
Without shoes in the rain
It's not about the heartache
Nothing left to say
We're two of a kind
You gotta smooth out your moves
It's not wrong that I'm right
There's more than just one groove
Y'all just need to chill
Real chill like an Eskimo
You and me baby yeah tell the rest to go
I'll pick you up and make you smile when you're down and low
I'll be the Sun and warm your feet when you're feeling cold
Leave your worry to like yesterday
And lean back lean back throw your problems away
Leave it where they lay live it day by day
Some be good some be chill
When we're just
We're two of a kind
You gotta smooth out your moves
It's not wrong that I'm right
There's more than just one groove
Y'all just need to chill
Y'all just need to chill
Guess I'm trying to say
