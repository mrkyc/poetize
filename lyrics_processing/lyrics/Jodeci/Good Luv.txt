You know we gonna flip it up just a little bit for y'all, so you all know
Somethin' mighty different
You know, you know, know, know, know yeah
You know, you know, you, you, you know, yeah

In the morning when I open up my eyes
I still be feelin' high from the love you gave last night, girl
But I still try to get it up with my friends
But they just think I'm crazy, oh
No more do I fit in, girl
They all be standing 'round smokin' all day
But I just get a hit or two
But it just don't feel the same, girl (No, no)
I know that I'd be meeting you any day
There's only one thing I have to say

You give good love in the morning or late at night
(Late at night)
Every second to minute it gets me high (Oh, oh)
Good love in the morning or late at night
It's amazing how our love could feel so right

Ah, yes, it's just a habit, I feel I have to have it
Every time I see you, girl, you know I wanna grab it
And yes I do admit it nothing can get with it
(Nothing can get with it)
When it comes to feelin' good, your love is so addictive
Yes, I do get my drink on, and I do have my fun
When it comes to love
I gotta get some of your good love
So I turn to you, 'cause no one else can do what you do
Girl, you're so good, oh yeah
