Yeah
Here I am sittin' in this fly ass hotel in Miami
Just watching the birds fly over the ocean
I guess I'm kinda trippin' 'cause I'm kinda high
And don't give a fuck
So I wanna come to you on the real, baby
And let you know how I feel
You know, for the last few days I've been watching you
Walk by my window with your little friends
I see how you make them laugh
I've been kinda envious of your friends
'Cause it's like, they're so close to you
And I can't find the right things to say to get close to you
This is the only time in my life that money doesn't matter
The only thing that matters is finding the perfect place for me and you
(You've got the time, I've got the place)
So if you've got the time, I got the place
(For everything, where me and you can hang)

One, two, three seconds are gone
Could've been gone a long time ago
So, baby, don't be shy
Tell your girlfriend bye-bye so we can roll
And we can get nasty on the way
My car's got tint so they won't see your face
There's no need to rein
Oh, what I wanna do to you is alright, baby

I've got a little place where we could hang out
No one will come around
So tell me if you're down and have no doubt about us (About us)
I know you've got the time
'Cause lately I've been seeing you with nothing on your mind
So put your thought to use
And think about me and you just getting loose

You're gonna love me all night long
So let's get it on
Let's get it on
All night long to the early morning
You've got the time (Ooh, yeah)

One, two, girl, one, two, girl, get in the car
And we can go very far while I be pumpin' up the good time
Rockin' the boomin' since I been chillin' with LL
Making your mouth swell, earrings jingling like the bells
So can you tell what's poppin'?
There ain't no stoppin' 'cause, baby, I'm droppin'
Those cavvy lines to get you in the back of my ride
You got the tizzime, so, baby, won't you get on the side and check it?

You're gonna love me all night long
So let's get it on, let's get it on
Let's get it on, all night long, to the early morning

So, baby, don't be ashamed (Come on, come on, come on, baby)
You've got the time (Oh yeah)
I've got the place (Me and you, me and you)
Hang (Me and you, me and you)
