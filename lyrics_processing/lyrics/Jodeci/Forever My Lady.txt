Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, woo
Forever, forever, forever

So you're having my baby
And it means so much to me
There's nothing more precious
Than to raise a family
If there's any doubt in your mind
You can count on me
I'll never let you down
Lady, believe in me

You and I
Will never fall apart
You and I
We knew right from the start, baby, baby
The day
We fell so far in love
Now our baby is born
Healthy and strong
Now our dreams are reality
