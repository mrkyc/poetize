Lay down, lay down, lay down, lay down, lay down!

Let me take you on a fantasy, can I do that?
Just grab on tight and hold my body
I'm gonna take you anywhere you want
Just get on top and hold me down, baby

Girl, don't you know, I feel you so
Can we just flow? (Can we just flow?)
Girl, don't you know, I feel you so (I feel you so)
Can we just flow? Baby, oh...

Can we get down? Get on down! Time to get down!
Can we get down? Get on down! Time to get down!

That smile you got just looks so fly
I don't have to roll this dime, 'cause you already got me high
Can you see where I'm trying to go?
I just want you to lay back and feel my flow

Girl, don't you know, I feel you so
Can we just flow? (Say it again! Say it again!)
Girl, don't you know, I feel you so
Can we just flow?

Girl, don't you know, I feel you so
Can we just flow?

So I beez rollin' in my six-fo', bouncin' in my trizzay
'Bout to fetch a trick and I'm 'bound to get busy on the set
But first I got to these B's wet, see
'Cause I beez the letter D, rollin' wit the Jodeci
And all the players wanna get close to me
Smoking with that old-timey Mickey D
And baby, don't you wanna get with me?
'Cause I'm so freaky
Get down, get down, get down
And girl you ought to get on down
Get down, get down, get down
And girl you ought to get on down
Get down, get down, get down
And girl you ought to get on down
Get down, get down, get down
Yo Playa, yo, help me wit' the sounds
Yo Static, get my fur out the closet, G
Get the keys, go warm up the Caddy
'Cause this baby 'bout to roll with us, you know what I'm sayin'
'Cause can't nobody freak it like us or do it like us so what the fuck
Baby, you got enough to go around, so get on down...

If you wanna party...
If you wanna party...
We could have a party...
