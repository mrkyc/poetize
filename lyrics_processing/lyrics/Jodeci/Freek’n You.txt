Every time I close my eyes
I wake up feelin' so horny
I can't get you out of my mind
'Cause sexin' you be all I see
I would give anything
Just to make you understand me
I don't give a damn about nothing else
Freekin' you is all I need

Tonight, I need your body (I need your body)
Tonight, you got my time (Girl, whatever you want, I would give it, baby)
Tonight you won't be sorry (Yeah, ooh-wee)
Tonight, you got my mind (You got my mind, all I wanna do is freek you)

Turned on by everything you do
And at night when I close my eyes
I only dream of freekin' you
