Baby, baby, baby, baby, I was thinkin' 'bout you last night
And when you left last night, you left me satisfied
It takes two to tango
Tell me can you handle
Come on, you know
You know you want some more

You know you want some more
You know you want some more
(Yeah, you know you want some more)
And if you want some more, open up my door
(You, oh, open up my, ha ha)
You know you want some more
(Open up my door)
You know you want some more
(Open up my door, open up my door, babe)
And if you want some more, open up my door

(I hear you) I hear you knocking at my door
(Knocking at my door)
Let's me know you want more (You want more)
Come and get it if you're with it
I'll touch you how you like it (Baby)
Is it sensitive? Do you wanna give?
(Do you wanna give some more? Listen)
Give some more, open my door
