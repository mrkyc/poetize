Promises you made me
All the things you told me
You said you'd never leave me
We'll be together for eternity
Now it's all in the past
Now I know our love will last
Lady, I will do all I can, ha
Lady, I will be all I am

I'll give you all you've had before
So come on in and close the door
Let me show you what I could be
Could you just please tell me

Will you believe in love (Hey)
And the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life (Yes, I do)
'Cause your love is why I live (Ooh)
Will you believe in love (Hey, hey)
And the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life
'Cause your love is why I live
(Ooh, ooh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
