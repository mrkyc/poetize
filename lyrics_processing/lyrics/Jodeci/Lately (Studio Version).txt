Lately, I've had the strangest feeling, oh yeah
With no vivid reason here to find
But yet the thought of losing you's been hanging
Around my mind ('round my mind)
K-Ci, sing it, sing it
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
And with you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know

I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry, yeah yeah, baby, well well
'Cause this time could mean good, goodbye
Bye-bye, farewell, farewell, farewell
Oh, you ought to tell me...

Lately I've been staring in the mirror, oh yeah
Very slowly picking me apart
Says, I'm trying to tell myself that I have no reason
With your heart, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah

I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
You just say that nothing changed

I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry, oh yes they do
'Cause this time (time) could (could) mean (mean) goodbye
Goodbye
I'm a man of many wishes, ooh yeah
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry, yeah
Yes, they do; yes, they do; yes, they do; yes, they do
'Cause this time could, could mean goodbye
It could mean goodbye, it could mean goodbye
My tears could mean goodbye

Lately I've had the strangest feeling
Lately I've had the strangest feeling
Lately I've had the strangest feeling
Lately I've had the strangest feeling
That you were gone
Lately I've had the strangest feeling
