Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

It's been so long
Since I touched a lady
And I'm still waiting
For you to come back to me, baby
Now will you forgive me
For the wrong I've done?
And let's try again
To make it last so long

I'm still waiting (Oh yeah, baby)
For you to come back to love
To fulfill this life we're dreaming of
So don't wait
Another day might be too long
Don't rush
Go slow so nothing goes wrong (Listen, baby)

Let me tell you something (Whoa, oh oh, oh oh)
