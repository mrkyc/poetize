Come in and shut the door
I can lay my back down on the floor
Girl, you are so bold
Come and take control, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ridin' up and down
Spin you on my lovin' round and round
Suck on your toes
We can start to flow

If you love (Oh yeah), then you can ride (Oh yeah)
I wanna slide tonight, baby (Tonight)
I gotta taste your love tonight, sugar
(Say it again one more time, come on)
If you love, you can ride (Oh, oh, oh)
I wanna slide tonight, baby (Oh, oh, oh yeah)
I'm gonna hit it oh so right, sugar
(Said you know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Feel my tongue move up and down
I can taste the water streaming down
Girl, you taste so fine (So fine)
You're one of a kind, you're one of a kind
Lady, move with me
So I can keep you humpin' to my beat
Don't you worry 'bout the time
As we start to climb
