Been watching you, baby, for a long time
You look so good, got my eyes on you

I've been watching you for so very long
Trying to get my nerve built up to be so strong
I really want to meet you but I'm kind of scared
'Cause you're the kind of lady with so much class
Get my thoughts together for the very next day
But when I see you, lady, I forget what to say
Your eyes and hair, such a beautiful tone
The way you dress and walk, it really turns me on
Ooh, you really turn me on
Ooh, you really turn me on
Come on, come on, come on

Come and talk to me, I really want to meet you
Can I talk to you? I really want to know you
Come and talk to me, I really want to meet you
Can I talk to you? I really want to know you

There you are again, with the same smile each day
I wanna know what it is that makes me feel this way
I wish I could grab you, tell you what it means to me
To see you walking by my way, it really makes my day
Before I go to sleep and dream about you
I'm a single man, I hope that you are single too
So why do I seek something to set my mind free?
'Cause curiosity is bugging the hell outta me, baby
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, baby
