I'm kinda lonely
So what's up? Can I call you tonight? What's your number?
5-5-3 and I'm gettin' nasty
Think I wanna call her, hahaha
Aw, yeah
Wanna change the pace, fuck up the bass?
Excuse me baby, (Mm, yeah)
5-5-3 and I'm gettin' nasty
Excuse me baby, (Yeah, yeah)
5-5-3 and I'm gettin' nasty

I guess I'm in a trance, my baby don't understand
It's far beyond romance, you still have my love and care
I really need someone who's nasty as can be
Excuse me, baby, that's her with that funky body
She passed her number and said, "Call me anytime"
It seems like every night she pops right in my mind
I only called just to see what could be
She said, "Come over here and, baby, play with me"

Excuse me, baby, if you start to wonder
She's just my play thang
Don't know her name, I just know her number
She's just my play thang

DeVante (Let's get mature)

So complex, the definition of a word called sex
You won't find in a book context
And even better when you starts to flex, you're next
Yo, I get her wet
She's legit
And on the board the lady won't quit
And when I'm doin' her in the split, no doubt (Sup, D?)
Ask her 'bout what she wanna get

Let's salsa, yo (5-5-3 and I'm gettin' nasty), let's dance, yo
Let's house, ready? (5-5-3 and I'm gettin' nasty), yo
Let's dance, all the brothas in the house
Let's dance, all the sistas in the house
Let's dance, all the ladies in the house
Let's dance, all the fellas in the house
Let's dance, all the boys in the house
Let's dance, all the girls in the house (My, my play thang)
Let's dance
