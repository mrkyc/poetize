A'ight, let's kick it, come on baby

Yesterday was boring for straight two months now
How did we do it? I just don't know how
Life's a real big drag without you
You have to feel the same 'cause our love was so true
Your friends told me that you kept up with me
I don't understand why we both can't see
Why is it this way when we knew it could be?
If we both just stop and listen to me, yeah

Lonely days are here again (I know they are)

In your smile I knew you wasn't with it

It won't take no time for our hearts to mend
