Lay back, baby
We're about to take you to L.A
Enjoy the ride, baby
Shit going out to Compton, Long Beach, South Central
Watts in the house
A little West Coast flavor for all y'all L.A. lovers out there
You know what I'm sayin'?
And y'all need to just shut the fuck up and let me do this, alright?

Girl, where is our child?
Send him to your mother's for a while
All my friends are gone
You know I sent them home
Girl, I live for you
So I don't give a fuck about the news
So please turn off the TV
And if you give a damn about me
I wanna hear you moan

Let's be alone
(I wanna hear you moan)
I wanna hear you moan
(So that we could get it on)
Let's be alone
So we can get it on
Let's be alone
(Yeah, you tell me, can you, can you moan, yeah)
I wanna hear you moan
Let's be alone
(Check me out) (Check it)

What's better than you and me?
You're better than a, mmm, damn movie
Our love is so much fun
Let's do some freaky shit
And then I'll make you cum
What compares to us?
I love we have so much trust
Tell me can you see
I was made for you and you for me
I wanna hear you moan

Let's be alone
(I wanna hear you moan)
I wanna hear you moan
Let's be alone
(So we could get it on)
So we can get it on
Let's be alone
(And you know) I wanna hear you moan (Baby)
Let's be alone

Come and see me, baby
I'll be that nigga on the side
As long as you let me keep taking you for the long ride
Yeah, my crew think I'm a sucker for playin' second, but check it
They don't know the one that's doin' the real punani wreckin'
And she said, "That's the way the love go"
No, no, I don't think so
Give me a car, a crib, plus a little dough
'Cause she wouldn't notice me if I didn't roll with Jodeci
Beep, beep, there goes my pager
Now she wantin' to come on home with me
Yo, baby (Let's be alone)
I swear I love you (Well, well, well)
I really do (Well, well, well, well, well)
So we can do this (Get it on) (Let's be alone)
Yeah, all night long (Oh yeah)

Hey, special lady, unplug the phone
(Lady, unplug that phone)
'Cause no one is home; girl, we're alone
(There's no one around, no, no)
Hey special lady, let's get it on
(We can get it on)
You know what's going on, if you wanna bone
Tell me, let me hear you moan

Let's be alone
(I wanna hear you moan)
I wanna hear you moan (Baby)
Let's be alone
So we can get it on
Let's be alone
(I wanna hear you moan)
I wanna hear you moan (All night long, baby)
Let's be alone
I wanna hear you moan (I)
Let's be alone
(Wanna take you another world)
I wanna hear you moan
Let's be alone
(Let me take you to another place and time, baby)
So we can get it on
Let's be alone
(Feel your body all around)
I wanna hear you moan
Let's be alone
(Lick you from head to toe all night long)
