Well I'm the man in black, with a jean that slacks
I don't smoke crack, so my lovin' ain't wack
But who says "crack is wack"? What is a rack of a girly's back?
Fact is, I'm no lack, miss
I go smooth, with no delayin'
So check what I'm sayin', honeydip, I'm not playin'
'Cause once you come in, it's off with the boots
And I start seducing, let loose the juicin'
Aw yeah! I was in and out of there
Yeah, I played you like a game of double-dare
I got sex skills like you've never seen before
From the sink, to the tub, to the floor
So here's your ticket to your love flight to ecstasy
Since it's up to me, I won't half step G
So when you wanna come on by
Don't forget your pills, we're gonna fly

We can leave tonight
(Let's take a seven) Let's take a seven-third tonight
(Let's fly through another world, yeah) Let's fly through another world
(No one) No one but me and you, girl
