Don't talk, just listen
First of all
I have to be honest with you, baby
I lied
When I told you I never wanted to see you again
Can you (Please stay, babe, hey, ay)
Just for tonight?
And maybe we can do something like
Make love, watch the sunrise
Or listen to JoJo, K-Ci sing us a verse
Slide, close, baby
Ha, let DeVante feel you
Oh, you feel so sexy and so good

I'm sorry I left you, I left you crying
Since you've been gone, I've been all alone
'Cause all of my tears, you know they left me drowning
Please, baby I'm begging for you to stay at home

Tonight, let's start our love again (Start love again)
Tonight, we could be more than just friends
(Don't you know) The sun (You know what?) it is going down
So baby won't you stay for a little while
(Baby, won't...)
