Your fucking proud
Look, it is not your tired etc, etc, etc
I said I am sorry
You know, I am sorry
I am more sorry to you now
Moved apart and we alwys imagined it
I won't say why
It's alright, I told you
It won't happen again."
So what contraception's an angel gonna use
When his little halo his little halo
Went and split went and split
His little halo went and split
Held her arms length
Disgusted fingertip bids him
What eeny weeny tales you gonna chase behind
Behind the line in the bible, snooks
A line from the bible
It'll be alright
It'll be more careful
It'll be more careful
And it'll be beautiful

Little wet nose
Adoration and juice in those
Fresh for sniffing curly girls
Girls drunk on  and cherry cherubim
Yum Yum
What can you do for him?
You cannot sweat enough beneath him
Touch him, but you cannot reach him
Scream, squeeze the sea and and hail the breeze from the surf
My way's from jesus
Squeeze fucking squeeze fucking squeeze
Squeeze it squeeze it squeeze
Beneath the light we chose the one you need to see
And  tunnel so thoughtfully
Darling of raspberry
Lip bit
Mother and shit shit shit
But angel's on a misson to earn redemptive ears
So what does an angel use
What does an angel do
What does an angel chose to do
Earn geometrical halos perfecto
Shown rusted desperate graffiti
Scroll beneath the hundreth cove of god
And upon pterodactyl's brow wins
Fingers tear out no wings, no feathers
No double sixes
You lose, move away from the table
Move away
The click of necklace, glass, and teeth
Are misty those windows from breath
Smeared, crying, prying
See
Do not penetrate me, oh my angel
Do not penetrate me
Do not penetrate me, oh my angel
For no angel surely would
For no angel surely would
Not one a little more love to grow
