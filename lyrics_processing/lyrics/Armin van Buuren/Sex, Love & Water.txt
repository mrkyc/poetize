Take your time, now find your groove
It's alright, we can do this all night
I just know your sexy body, is alright
We can be here all night

All we really need is sex, love, and water
Just do the things you want and make love all night
All I really need is sex, love, and water
Just do the things you want and make love all night

Give me all that, give me all that
Just give me all that, give me all that

Just do the things you want and make love all night
