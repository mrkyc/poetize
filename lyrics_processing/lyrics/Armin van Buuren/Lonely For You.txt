Only lonely for you at night
Only lonely for you at night
The sun doesn't shine
And I try to forget why
Why you're not here by my side
Only lonely for you at night, ah

Made it through another day
Don't even feel the pain, it's fading
I've been cleaning out my brain
I quit you like cocaine, life changing

I start to panic when the sun goes down
I stay this jacked 'til the lights go out
I don't wanna go back home
Don't wanna be alone right now

No, you're never gonna see me cry
I already got a brand new life
Don't you know I'm moving on
And everyday I'm stronger
I don't even know you're gone

Only lonely for you at night
Only lonely for you at night
The sun doesn't shine
And I try to forget why
Why you're not here by my side
Only lonely for you at night, ah

Wide awake, I'm in the dark
The spiral in my heart is storming, yeah
I just gotta close my eyes and
Know that I'll survive 'til morning

I start to panic when the sun goes down
I stay this jacked 'til the lights go out
I just wanna call your phone
Don't wanna be alone right now

No, you're never gonna see me cry
I already got a brand new life
Don't you know I'm moving on
And everyday I'm stronger
I don't even know you're gone
(I don't even know that you're gone)
Only lonely for you at night (I'm only lonely for you)
Only lonely for you at night
The sun doesn't shine
And I try to forget why (Oh, try to forget)
Why you're not here by my side (Ooh, ooh)
Only lonely for you at night, ah

I'm only lonely for you
