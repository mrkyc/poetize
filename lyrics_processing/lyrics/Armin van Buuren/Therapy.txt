I can't dance, 'cause my feet won't let me
And I can't love, 'cause my heart won't let go
I can't tell no one the way I really feel
'Cause I don't feel nothing no more

And I came here
To remember what it's like
To hold someone
And then I saw you dancing on your own and

You look like therapy
Exactly what I need
You're where the darkness meets the light, yeah
The perfect remedy
To heal what's hurting me
Come be the therapy for me
And me for you, tonight

I can tell by the way that you move
There's a cure for me somewhere in you
Your touch, your kiss, and your body next to mine
I just want a bit of your time
