There lived a rich but aged man whose hair was turning gray
He had three sons three only ones both Jack and Tom were sly
But Ted was honest as could be he would not tell a lie
The brothers tried to ruin Ted before the old man's eyes
At last the plot begin its work till Ted was much despised
The father then said begone you're heartless to the core
Then the black's sheeps words they came just a ringing thru the door
Don't be angry with me dad don't drive me from your door
I know that I've been wayward but I won't be anymore
Just give me one more chance and put me to the test
You'll find the black sheep loves his dad for better than the rest
Year by year sped quickly by the father now grown old
He called to them both Jack and Tom and gave them all his gold
I only need a little room a place at your fireside
One night on Jacks' returning home he brought with him a bride
The three began to hate the father more and more each day
At last he heard the three declare why the old fool's in our way
They then agreed to send him to the poorhouse that was near
Then like a flash the black sheep's words came ringing in his ear
A wagon drives up to the door it is the poorhouse band
The brothers pointed to their dad right there is your man
Then a manly form appeared came rushin' through the crowd
Stop this you brutes the lad replied it shall not be allowed
You took the old man's property and all that he could save
You've even sold the little lot containing mother's grave
I am his son but not your kin from now till judgement day
The father clasped the black sheep's hand and they all heard him say
Don't be angry with me son I know I drove you from my door
I know that I've been foolish lad I've repented o'er and o'er
I should have given you my gold for you have stood the test
