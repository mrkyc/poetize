Most nights I can keep it buried in the back of my head
On most nights I can have a couple drinks, I can take of the edge
And then I don't have to think about, try not to think about you
That's what I do on most nights, but tonight

I'm gonna miss you, I let it hit me
I'm gonna sit here and wish you were with me
I'm gonna let that goodbye hurt me
I wanna feel it, no mercy
I reminisce you, I'm gonna go there
I know I shouldn't, but right now I don't care
'Stead of spendin' my night losin' the fight, tryin' to forget you
Baby I-I, I'm gonna miss you

Most nights I try to stay away from any memory
From those nights when you were still sleepin', dreamin' next to me
But I'm 'bout to put on Continuum and slow dance in this burnin' room

I'm gonna miss you, I let it hit me
I'm gonna sit here and wish you were with me
I'm gonna let that goodbye hurt me
I wanna feel it, no mercy
I reminisce you, I'm gonna go there
I know I shouldn't, but right now I don't care
'Stead of spendin' my night losin' the fight, tryin' to forget you
Baby I-I, I'm gonna miss you

I'm gonna think about Charleston, weekend Airbnb
And that Carolina heat had nothin' on you and me
I'm gonna think about that first kiss in the rain, it was June
Remember how we said forever? I'm gonna think about that too

I'm gonna miss you, I let it hit me
I'm gonna sit here and wish you were with me
I'm gonna let that goodbye hurt me
I wanna feel it, no mercy
I reminisce you, I'm gonna go there
I know I shouldn't, but right now I don't care
'Stead of spendin' my night losin' the fight, tryin' to forget you
Baby I-I, I'm gonna miss you
