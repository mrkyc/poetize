Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ha, ha)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

She's like a picture from an airplane window
It's always sunny up above the clouds
She's got a mouth full of innuendo
But she makes it sound innocent somehow
Those hungry eyes can't be denied
Take me to church, show me the light
Straight masterpiece, way out of my league
Yeah but I'm gonna hold her like a trophy tonight

She's decoratin' my car
Soon she'll be breakin' my heart
She's too Wild Horses to be all mine
I'll be your Beast of Burden on borrowed time
She's gonna rip off any kind of label
She's into leavin' those strings untied
Keepin' it tax free, under the table
She might only be mine tonight
But that's alright, that's okay
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
That's alright, might hurt, but hey
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
You might also like
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I ain't gonna sit here and overthink it
I got a tiger by the tail
I'll just smile when she sinks her teeth in
She'll leave a scar and a story to tell

She's decoratin' my car
Soon she'll be breakin' my heart
She's too Wild Horses to be all mine
I'll be your Beast of Burden on borrowed time
She's gonna rip off any kind of label
She's into leavin' those strings untied
Keepin' it tax free, under the table
She might only be mine tonight
But that's alright, that's okay
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
That's alright, might hurt, but hey
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away

Hey hey, hey hey
She's gonna sting me but damn it I want it
Hey hey, hey hey
Honey's so sweet in that moment
She's decoratin' my car
Soon she'll be breakin' my heart
She's too Wild Horses to be all mine
I'll be your Beast of Burden on borrowed time
She's gonna rip off any kind of label
She's into leavin' those strings untied
Keepin' it tax free, under the table
She might only be mine tonight
But that's alright, that's okay
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
That's alright, might hurt, but hey
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
Hey hey, yeah
Hey hey, yeah
Hey hey, yeah
