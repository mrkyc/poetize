Caught you wishin' at the window last night
Wonderin' if the moon was talkin' back
I got a feelin' that you got God's ear
I know I feel like He's closer when you're here
It's like you got a song in your head that nobody else knows
So just follow it baby wherever it goes
It's gonna hurt to let you go, but any go fly
So high, so high

I could watch you dancin' forever
Turnin' those stars into letters
Write your name in the sky
When you laugh, when you cry
Just catch that breeze like a feather
Turn your tears into treasures
When you're here, when you're gone
I'll be here, lookin' on
So keep on dancin' forever

There's somethin' in the way you're lookin' right now
It's tellin' me my time is runnin' out
I guess I'm waitin' on your next move
All this time I thought I was leadin' you
Now look at you
You might also like
I Can watch you dancin' forever
Turnin' those stars into letters
Write your name in the sky
When you laugh, when you cry
Just catch that breeze like a feather
Turn your tears into treasures
When you're here, when you're gone
I'll be here, lookin' on
So keep on dancin' forever
Yeah keep on dancin' forever

It's like you got a song in your head that nobody else knows
So just follow it baby wherever it goes
It's gonna hurt to let you go, but any go fly
So high, so high

I Can watch you dancin' forever
Turnin' those stars into letters
Write your name in the sky
When you laugh, when you cry
Just catch that breeze like a feather
Turn your tears into treasures
When you're here, when you're gone
I'll be here, lookin' on
So keep on dancin' forever
