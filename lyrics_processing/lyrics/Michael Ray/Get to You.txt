Somebody had to hurt you bad
For you to give up like that
Somebody had to break your heart in two
But that ain't me and you
So tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
You can't look me in the eye
What am I supposed to do?
When you say we're through
Why do you?

Run away, run away from love
What the hell are you so scared of?
You walk away when you've had enough
Of trying, of trying
Girl there's always gonna be some pain
A little sunshine, a little rain
It doesn't mean it ain't worth it babe
I'm trying, I'm trying to get to you
To you

One day you're gonna love again
Mess up and let somebody in
To every part of your whole world
You think it's unthinkable girl
But somebody's gonna break those walls
Somebody's gonna watch you fall
Gonna give it your all and I hope that I'm around
When you finally find out why you
You might also like
Run away, run away from love
What the hell are you so scared of?
You walk away when you've had enough
Of trying, of trying
Girl there's always gonna be some pain
A little sunshine, a little rain
It doesn't mean it ain't worth it babe
I'm trying, I'm trying to get to you
To you

So tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
You can't look me in the eye
What am I supposed to do?
When you say we're through
Why do you?

Run away, run away from love
What the hell are you so scared of?
You walk away when you've had enough
Of trying, of trying
Girl there's always gonna be some pain
A little sunshine, a little rain
It doesn't mean it ain't worth it babe
I'm trying, I'm trying to get to you
To you
Somebody had to hurt you bad
For you to give up like that
Somebody had to break your heart in two
