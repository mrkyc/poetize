Moonlight shinin' through the cypress trees
Bouncin' off Stillwater's runnin' deep
If you wanna stay awake still the break of dawn, you're on
If you wanna twist off the top on some apple pie
Crawl all over me like a kudzu vine
I'll burn all night for you, don't think I won't, you're on

You're on ever country song dashboard station
Every shirt I got, your perfume ain't fadin'
You're on those empty beer cans in my truck bed
That's your kiss, that's your red that ain't comin' off
You're on my mind, all the damn time
Girl you're on your way to killin' me tonight
I wanna be that lean in, close your eyes
Full moon high you're on

You light me up when you run your fingers through my hair
Like a night owl's eyes in the low beam glare
You're never off, but tonight I swear
Yeah girl I swear

You're on ever country song dashboard station
Every shirt I got, your perfume ain't fadin'
You're on those empty beer cans in my truck bed
That's your kiss, that's your red that ain't comin' off
You're on my mind, all the damn time
Girl you're on your way to killin' me tonight
I wanna be that lean in, close your eyes
Full moon high you're on
You might also like
Like red mud clay on these grips
Like summer time on your lips

You're on ever country song dashboard station
Every shirt I got, your perfume ain't fadin'
You're on those empty beer cans in my truck bed
That's your kiss, that's your red that ain't comin' off
You're on my mind, all the damn time
Girl you're on your way to killin' me tonight
I wanna be that lean in, close your eyes
I wanna be that lean in, close your eyes
Full moon high you're on
