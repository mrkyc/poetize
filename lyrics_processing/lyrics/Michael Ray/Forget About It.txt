Forget about it
Forget about it
Forget about it

What's wrong girl? You're lookin' down and out
I'm sittin' over here tryin' to figure it out
Why a pretty girl like you is corner booth cryin'
All alone, well who wrecked your world? On a Friday night
You should be movin' slow in the neon lights
Held close with a kiss, feelin' right
'Stead of waitin' by the phone
Didn't he hold the door? Didn't he bring ya flowers?
Girl you deserve down on one knee with a ring in front of that Eiffel Tower

Forget about it, he ain't in the picture no more, shut the door
Block it out, I'm here right now to unbreak your heart
Let's chase a good time and erase the pain
The hurt and the tears and the wasted jeers
You need a little bit of "Hey, baby come of here"
Let me buy you a beer, get to workin' on movin' on
When it comes to him, forget about it

Whatcha say girl? How do we turn it around?
Maybe move to the bar, knock some whiskeys down
Hit the dance floor and get down
Baby are you down to
You might also like
Forget about it, he ain't in the picture no more, shut the door
Bock it out, I'm here right now to unbreak your heart
Let's chase a good time and erase the pain
The hurt and the tears and the wasted jeers
You need a little bit of "Hey, baby come of here"
Let me buy you a beer, get to workin' on movin' on
When it comes to him, forget about it

Forget about it, he ain't in the picture no more, shut the door
Bock it out, I'm here right now to unbreak your heart
Let's chase a good time and erase the pain
The hurt and the tears and the wasted jeers
You need a little bit of "Hey, baby come of here"
Let me buy you a beer, get to workin' on movin' on
When it comes to him, forget about it

Forget about it
