Damn my AP goin' psycho, lil mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody, with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo, for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody, with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though
You stuck in the friend zone

I tell that four-give the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts Dechino the shit (Ayy)
Try to stuff it all in but it don't even fit (Ayy)
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit (Ayy)
I made my first million I'm like, "Shit, this is it" (Ayy)
30 for a walk through man, we had that bitch lit
Had so many bottles gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo we get seen in the rent
And I'm like "Whoa man, My neck so goddamn cold"
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go
My money thick won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

You should see the whip, promise I can take yo bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch I can make the ass drop
Uh, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright

Stars on the roof, they matchin' with the jewelry
