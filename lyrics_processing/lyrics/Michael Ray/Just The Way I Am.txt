Hug your neck, say I love you, instead of saying goodbye
Ain't looking for one, but won't run from a fight
I got too much pride
Hey, I'm the kind of guy
That likes the simple life, mmh
The only suit and tie I own
Is for when heaven calls somebody home
I'm a cross around my neck
I'm a hard to keep my temper in check
I'm a night you might regret
I'm that time that you'll never forget
I'm that, "Hey, can I get a cigarette?"
How much you wanna bet I'ma get her
She's just playing hard to get, man
Amen, raise a hand on a Sunday
That's just the way I am
Hey man, give a damn from the country
That's just the way I am
Yeah, might cuss a little more than I probably should
I'm a poor man's Hemingway back in the woods
I take a little while to get to know
But once you know me then you know
You might also likeThat I'm the kind of guy, hey
That's always down to ride or drive
I'll be a good old boy to the bone
Till the good Lord calls me home
I'm a cross around my neck
I'm a hard to keep my temper in check
I'm a night you might regret
I'm that time that you'll never forget
I'm that, "Hey, can I get a cigarette?"
How much you wanna bet I'ma get her
She's just playing hard to get, man
Amen, raise a hand on a Sunday
That's just the way I am
Hey man, give a damn from the country
That's just the way I am
I'm the salt on my collar
Working hard on a dollar
Friday night hoot and holler
Kind of guy from out yonder
I'm a beer off a backroad
Fishing with a cane pole
Smoking on some on some hand-rolled, yeah
I'm a cross around my neck
I'm a cross around my neck
I'm a hard to keep my temper in check
I'm a night you might regret
I'm that time that you'll never forget
I'm that, "Hey, can I get a cigarette?"
How much you wanna bet I'ma get her
She's just playing hard to get, man
Amen, raise a hand on a Sunday
That's just the way I am
Hey man, give a damn from the country
