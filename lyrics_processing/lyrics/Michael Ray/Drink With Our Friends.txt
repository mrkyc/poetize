Live free or die
Don't tread on me
Ain't just stickers in a window
Of this two-tone white and gold '93
Workin' way more than forty
Darin' that sun to go down
We save a little somethin' for the weekend
'Cause soon as we clock it out

Are you ready? Say oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, if you're ready
If you're ready, say oh yeah, oh yeah

We turn it up, tie one on
We fill our cups with somethin' strong
We fly our flag too high in this town
Just try to come and take it down
We pay our dues, say our prayers
Raisin' hell in the middle of nowhere
Heaven-bound, whiskey bent
We only fight with the devil and drink with our friends

Lynyrd Skynyrd on a T-shirt
Little bad in her attitude
Rock my world, little country girl
Got her name on my tattoo
You might also like
Are you ready? Say oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, if you're ready
If you're ready, say oh yeah, oh yeah

We turn it up, tie one on
We fill our cups with somethin' strong
We fly our flag too high in this town
Just try to come and take it down
We pay our dues, say our prayers
Raisin' hell in the middle of nowhere
Heaven-bound, whiskey bent
We only fight with the devil and drink with our friends

Oh yeah, we're gonna drink with our friends

If you're ready, say oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, if you're ready
If you're ready, say oh yeah, oh yeah

We turn it up, tie one on
We fill our cups with somethin' strong
We fly our flag too high in this town
Just try to come and take it down
We pay our dues, say our prayers
Raisin' hell in the middle of nowhere
Heaven-bound, whiskey bent
We only fight with the devil and drink with our friends
