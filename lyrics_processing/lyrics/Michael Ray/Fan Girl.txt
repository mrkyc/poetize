Girl, I know how people feel
When they're watching their favorite band
Their whole world starts coming alive
And, girl, I can't hide it for real
I don't know if you understand
Looking at you kinda feels like when the lights go down
Got a ticket to the best show in town

You give me that front-row feeling, screaming with my hands up
Walk in the room and everybody stands up
You got my heart singing whoa-oh-oh-oh
You steal my kisses and you steal the show
You know the way you work it, baby, you're a natural
They love you in LA, NYC, and Nashville
That leather jacket and blue jean, I mean damn girl
I can't help it, baby, I'm a fan girl

Got me in the palm of your hand, girl
More than I can stand, girl
Baby I'm a fan girl

Girl, when you're in my arms you shine like a bright star
Give me the best night of my life kinda high
Being next to you kinda feels like in a spotlight glow
With a t-shirt with your face on yeah
You might also like
Oh you give me that front-row feeling, screaming with my hands up
Walk in the room and everybody stands up
You got my heart singing whoa-oh-oh-oh
You steal my kisses and you steal the show
You know the way you work it, baby, you're a natural
They love you in LA, NYC, and Nashville
That leather jacket and blue jean, I mean damn girl
I can't help it, baby I'm a fan girl

Got me in the palm of your hand, girl
More than I can stand, girl
Baby I'm a fan girl

Looking at you kinda feels like when the lights go down
Got a ticket to the best show in town

You give me that front-row feeling, screaming with my hands up
Walk in the room and everybody stands up
You got my heart singing whoa-oh-oh-oh
You steal my kisses and you steal the show
The way you work it, baby, you're a natural
They love you in LA, NYC, and Nashville
That leather jacket and blue jean, I mean damn, girl
I can't help it, baby I'm a fan girl
Got me in the palm of your hand, girl
More than I can stand, girl
Baby, I'm a fan girl
