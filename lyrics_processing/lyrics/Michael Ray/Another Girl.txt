And put her boots on
She got all prettied up
Rockin' in the mirror
To a country song
Girls in the driveway pickin' her up
She can hear that bass drum kickin'
All week long she been bottled up
Like a time bomb ticking
Aw, now look at her go
Sippin' on somethin'
On the way to the show
Flirtin' her way
To the front row
She got her moonlight wild side
Crazy coming out on a Friday night
Straight out of another world
She turns into another girl
You gotta stand back watch her move
One that the band's all singing to
Spin around like a tilt-a-whirl
I can't look at another girl
Another girl

No, she don't say much
She's a little shy tied
Don't ever hear her say much
Oh, if they could see her now
They wouldn't recognize her
Wearing some boys hat she just met
Holding up her beer like a lighter
She got her moonlight wild side
Crazy coming out on a Friday night
Straight out of another world
She turns into another girl
You gotta stand back watch her move
One that the band's all singing to
Spin around like a tilt-a-whirl
Yeah, I can't look at another girl
Another girl
Turns into another girl
There ain't ever been another girl
That can move me like she does
I can't take my eyes off of her
She got her moonlight wild side
Crazy coming out on a Friday night
Straight out of another world
She turns into another girl
You gotta stand back watch her move
One that the band's all singing to
Spin around like a tilt-a-whirl
I can't look at another girl
Yeah, look at her go
She's getting down in the front row
