They all said I wouldn't amount to nothin'
But I know a thing or two about a thing or two, yeah
Ain't gonna tell it all but I'll tell you somethin'
'Cause there's a lot of things they don't teach in school

I got my higher education
Good ol' boy, bad reputation
School of hard knocks with a 4.0
Learnin' how to rock, learnin' how to roll
That homegrown into paper
Just a minor with a major
In hell raisin' low expectations
From a higher education

Well, I learned cigarettes go good with whiskey
And old guys know the best jokes at the bar (Aw, tell 'em about it, Kid)
Don't pass up on a chance to smoke with Willie (You know I would never, brother)
And pretty girls like guys that play guitar (Yes, they do)

I got my higher education
Good ol' boy, bad reputation
School of hard knocks with a 4.0
Learnin' how to rock, learnin' how to roll
That homegrown into paper
Just a minor with a major
In hell raisin' low expectations
From a higher education, yeah
Take 'em to school, Billy
