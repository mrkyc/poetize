If you want 'em straight lace, with a record that's clean
Not drivin' you wild by the time they're sixteen
Not out raisin' hell, makin' noise
Don't give a truck, don't give a truck
If you want 'em clean cut and walkin' that line
Go write this down, keep it in mind
Mamas if you got a choice
Don't give a truck

Don't give a truck to a boy with some wild in his eyes and some free in his soul, yeah, he'll want one
But don't give a truck to a boy with some wind in his wings and a song to sing
Anywhere but toward ya, yeah, I'll just warn ya
He'll go and get stuck
Too fast to grow up
He'll end up like us
So don't give a truck to a boy

He'll worry you crazy and break the girls' hearts
He'll find a dirt road and drive it too far
Just like his dad did before
So don't give a truck

Don't give a truck to a boy with some wild in his eyes and some free in his soul, yeah, he'll want one
But don't give a truck to a boy with some wind in his wings and a song to sing
Anywhere but toward ya, yeah, I'll just warn ya
He'll go and get stuck
Too fast to grow up
He'll end up like us
So don't give a truck to a boy
Don't give a truck to a boy

Ain't gonna tell you how to raise 'em
Hell no, just sayin'
If you don't wanna spend your nights prayin'

Don't give a truck to a boy with some wild in his eyes and some free in his soul, he'll want one
But don't give a truck to a boy with some wind in his wings and a song to sing
Anywhere but toward ya, yeah, I'll just warn ya
He'll go and get stuck
Too fast to grow up
He'll end up like us
So don't give a truck to a boy
