She pulled up in a Mustang
With Alabama license plates
Blarin' old school "Purple Rain"
A little buzz helped me get her name
She was two rooms down from mine
And we turned room 309
Into a party every single night
Until the week ran out and we said goodbye

Now I wonder what that girl from spring break's doin' now
Is she back in Alabama, two kids and a house?
Or did she move to Cali like she said she was gonna?
Underneath the pier on a beach in Daytona?
I wonder if she smiles when she looks at the tattoo we got that night
'Cause God knows I do every now and then, catch myself thinkin' about
What the girl from spring break's doin' now

We smoked Swishers on the balcony
And every kiss tasted just as sweet
We drank Southern Comfort
Straight out of the bottle
Got a little sand up in the sheets
You might also like
Now I wonder what that girl from spring break's doin' now
Is she back in Alabama, two kids and a house?
Or did she move to Cali like she said she was gonna?
Underneath the pier on a beach in Daytona?
I wonder if she smiles when she looks at the tattoo we got that night
'Cause God knows I do every now and then, catch myself thinkin' about
What the girl from spring break's doin' now

We said we'd call, we said we'd write
But you know how it goes when time goes by

Yeah I wonder what that girl from spring break's doin' now
Is she back in Alabama, two kids and a house?
Or moved to Cali like she said she was gonna?
Underneath the pier on a beach in Daytona?
I wonder if she smiles when she looks at the tattoo we got that night
'Cause God knows I do every now and then, catch myself thinkin' about
What that girl from spring break's doin' now

I wonder what she's doin' now
Is she back in Alabama?
Or on the coast of California?
