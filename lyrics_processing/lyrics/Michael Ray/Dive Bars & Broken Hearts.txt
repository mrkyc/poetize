On and off again, that's how the story goes
We only like our labels on longnecks nice and cold
You're hangin' over me and I'm hung up on you
Yeah, we're both bringin' heartbreak back in style like it's cool

Damn, girl, we're no good, but somehow still so good
Guess I'm just a Jones song and you're my steel guitar
We'll dance on forever to that broken record
Girl, we go together like dive bars and broken hearts
Baby, love me slow, sunrise wakin' up a long night
Misery and gin, we go like dive bars and broken hearts

Guess I should move on, don't know where to start
Wouldn't know what to do without it tearin' me apart
Pawn shop diamond ring, cigarettes and smoke
Both need each other bad, but girl, we really don't

Damn, girl, we're no good, but somehow still so good
Guess I'm just a Jones song and you're my steel guitar
We'll dance on forever to that broken record
Girl, we go together like dive bars and broken hearts
Baby, love me slow, sunrise wakin' up a long night
Misery and gin, we go like dive bars and broken hearts
Can't seem to get it right, but we'll try it again tonight, yeah
We're right at home just like dive bars and broken hearts

We'll try it again tonight, yeah
We're right at home just like dive bars and broken hearts
