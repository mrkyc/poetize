Let's go
Ben-Ari.. Ghost...
Welcome to Our world...
Feel this....
Violin
Feel our pain...
We work hard
It's a struggle....
Let's go

Worked too hard, paid our dues
We gon' win, they gon' lose
Way too nice, can't fill our shoes
We gon' win, they gon' lose
Oh so hot, but stay so cool
We gon' win, they gon' lose
The violin's crazy, the words is too
We gon' win, they gon' lose

Crazy

We don't quit, we don't lose
Block fools, we don't move, if we don't choose
We ain't gotta say that it's big boy
We come through and make big noise
Even when it's quiet, homie
Mess around start a riot, homie
Hit the booth like there's fire on me
They know I'm the truth
No need sic'n a liar on me
Now what kind of men are we
I'm a gangsta comparin' off the sound of Miri Ben-Ari
Just listen to the violin strings
In the mind of mad man you can hear how triumph ring
It's the king of the slum and the violin king
You might also like
Worked too hard, paid our dues
We gon' win, they gon' lose
Way too nice, can't fill our shoes
We gon' win, they gon' lose
Oh so hot, but stay so cool
We gon' win, they gon' lose (they gon' lose)
The violin's crazy, the words is too (violin's crazy)
We gon' win, they gon' lose


Opportunity knock, open the door
Open your ears, you hear destiny call
I make music, let the rest of you ball
If you wanna touch a soul, I'm the kid you need to see
I got the recipe, y'all
It's G-H-O-S-T, Miri Ben-Ari
Feel the groove
Go against me, you lose
No doubt, we gon' win
YOu hear the violin blow
And me flow
Know the show gon' end

Worked too hard, paid our dues
We gon' win, they gon' lose
Way too nice, can't fill our shoes
We gon' win, they gon' lose
Oh so hot, but stay so cool
We gon' win, they gon' lose (they gon' lose)
The violin's crazy, the words is too
We gon' win, they gon' lose
Worked too hard, paid our dues
We gon' win, they gon' lose
Way too nice, can't fill our shoes
We gon' win, they gon' lose
Oh so hot, but stay so cool
We gon' win, they gon' lose
The violin's crazy, the words is too
We gon' win, they gon' lose

This is theme music....
This is dream music...
This is that get free music...
This is a gangsta with a violin...
This is noise and silence...
This is art...
