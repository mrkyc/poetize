Everybody knows that they guilty
Everybody knows that they've lied
Everybody knows that they guilty
Resting on their conscience eating their inside
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
Time to get free, or give yourselves up now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time

There's a war in the mind over territory
For the dominion
Who will dominate the opinion
Schisms and isms
Keeping us in forms of religion
Conforming our vision
To the world church's decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee election
Moral infection
Epidemic lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the highest possible order
Distorting our tape recorders
From hearing like under water
Beyond the borders
Find the sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
Of systematic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate worse than Sodom
What's got 'em drunk off the spirits
Truth comes, we can't hear it
When you've been programmed to fear it
I had a vision I was falling in indecision
Appalling, calling religious
Some program on television
How can dominant wisdom
Be recognized in the system
Of anti-christ, the majority rules
Intelligent fools
PhD's in illusion
Masters of mass confusion
Bachelors of past delusion
Now who you choosing
The head or the tail?
The bloodshed of the male
Or confidence in the veil?
Conferences at Yale
Discussing doctrines of Baal
Causing people to fail
Keeping the third in jail
His word has nailed
Everything to the tree
Severing all of me
From all that I used to be
Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoyed darkness as Lord
Keeping me from the sword
Blocked from mercy
Bitter than cerasee
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat we would eat
And still dine at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong to true enemies defeat?
Destitute in necessity
Causing desperation to get the best of me
Punishment till there was nothing left of me
Realizing the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only doctrine, supernatural circumcision
Inwardly, only water can purge the heart
From words to fiery darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity, shapen in
There's no escaping when
Your whole philosophy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Could it be all of humanity
Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of man's heart is black
How can we show up for
An invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow
Making love with a whore
Aching in sores
Babylon, the Great Mystery
Mother of human history
System of social sorcery
Our present condition
Needs serious recognition
Where there's no repentance
There can be no remission
And that sentence more serious than Vietnam
The atom bomb and Saddam and Minister Farrakhan
What's going on, what's a priority to you?
By what authority do we do
The majority hasn't a clue
We majored in curses
Search the chapters, check the verses
Recapture the land
Remove the mark from off of our hands
So we can stand
In agreement with His command
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand

It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
It's freedom, I'mma be who I am
It's freedom time, said it's freedom time
Everybody knows that they've lied
Everybody knows that they've perpetrated inside
Everybody knows that they guilty, yes
Resting on their conscience eating their insides
Get free, be who you're supposed to be
Freedom, said it's freedom time now
Freedom, said it's freedom time
