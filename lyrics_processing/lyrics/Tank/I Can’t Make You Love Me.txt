Oh, oh, yeah
No

Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
Don't patronize

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in this final hour
I will lay down my heart and feel the power if you won't
No, you won't

I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't, huh
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and feel the power if you won't
No, you won't

'Cause I can't make you love me, no
If you don't
Say you ain't gotta love, you ain't gotta love
You ain't gotta love it, hey
I can't just make you love me
(I can't make you love me, no)
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't now
(I can't do it)
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't now
(I tried my best)
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't now
(But you're puttin' my heart through the test)
I can't just make you love me
(Oh, I tried)
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't now
(I tried to get through to you, girl)
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't now
(Oh, can't you see that I'm crying out to you, girl)
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't now
I can't just make you love me
