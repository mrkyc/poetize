Ladies

Ladies
I'm the most beautiful girl in the world

In my book you can do no wrong from head to toe
In my book, I done wrote you songs so beautiful
You deserve every good thing that a man can give
You should have a life that only superstars live

Oh you hear a lot of talking
'Bout what they would do to you
Oh you seen a lot of walking
Soon as they were through with you
Let's appreciate you
Cause the truth is that you heaven sent

We can start off with some compliments
I can go on and on, killing you with these compliments
Words can't describe you but let me remind you
Say I'm sexy, I'm sexy
Say I'm fly, I'm fly
Girl, I can't let you by without a little compliments
You deserve every word of these compliments

Yeah, ladies

Ah damn, yo mama gotta be fine from head to toe
'Cause I'm looking at a baby she made so beautiful
Your smile alone could get you anything that a man can give
If I had it I'd give you the life that only superstars live

Oh you hear a lot of talking
'Bout what they would do to you
Oh you seen a lot of walking
Soon as they were through with you
Let's appreciate you
Cause the truth is that you heaven sent

Words can't describe you but let me remind you
Say I'm sexy, I'm sexy
Say I'm fly, I'm fly
Girl, I can't let you by without a little compliments
You deserve every word of these compliments
Ayy, one look at you in that dress
Can't help but think about sex
Out of all the girls I've met
I swear you officially the best
I love the way you stand in them heels
And the way you sit in that chair
In tight pants, no underwear, camel toe, with no hair
I love you manicure, your pedicure, what they hate about you I do adore
From Atlanta to Miami, to Los Angeles to New York
She ball hard play all sports, luxury of all sorts
Shoe game so insane and them pocketbooks is uncalled for
What's in your plans? Got a chance that you wanna chill?
'Cause you deserve a man with a hundred mill (I got it)
Still, other cats be thinkin' with their penis
I just call it like I seen it, I don't say it 'less I mean it
[Chorus: Tank & Kris Stephens
Compliments
I can go on and on, killing you with these compliments

Say I'm fly, I'm fly
Girl, I can't let you by without a little compliment
You deserve every word of these compliments
Ladies
I'm the most beautiful girl in the world
