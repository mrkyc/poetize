C Breezy in the building
Yeah, it's that R&B money right here, huh
Look, let's get it, huh

I brought hoes, I did that
Walked up in this motherfucker like, "The kid back"
You see the ice, you see the Range
Truth is, I'm just doin' this to cover up the pain
She left me for good reason
I disrespected home, you can call it treason
I'm here in bleedin' words while my heart is leakin'
Don't fuck with tonight, I think I'll be cheating, yeah

I told my waitress keep them bottles coming (Oh), women all around me
I've been single for two or three weeks now, but who's countin'?
Already replaced you with a new girl (New girl)
She don't do for me the things you do, girl

I'm still lonely
I'm still lonely
I'm steady tryin' to replace you with a new girl (New girl)
In the end, the only one I need is you, girl
I'm still

'Bout how he sheds his tears of a fuckin' clown
My heart is racin', could be the molly
Or the fact that she up in here lookin' good without me
Look at them bottles, them red bottoms, who was sponsorin' that?
I'm was gon' speak and try to make peace, but look at this damn crowd
Look at this damn crowd, nigga, just look at this damn crowd
Yeah, it's poppin', but if you with it, we can leave now

I told my waitress keep them bottles coming (Oh), women all around me
