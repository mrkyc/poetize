Once she see the sauce
Now ya know she gotta have it
Let her meet the boss
Put her hands on the package
I know what it costs
Cuz I got a bad habit
Of turning good girls
Like you into a savage
Ohhhh ohh ohh
Turning good girls
Like you into a savage
Ohhhh ohh ohh
Turning good girls
Like you into a savage

I'm a real fucking trapper
Once I set the trap
I be fuckin something after
Pick 'em hardly sweet
Just to run up out 'em faster
She was kinda neat and
Now she almost a disaster
I'm a real fucking master
I took her to school
And now she taking up like massa
Used to wait and now
A nigga ain't'n gotta ask her
I gave her the tools
Now the bitch way badder
You might also like
Oh no, My god
What have you done
She doin' things
She never done
I gave her game
She having fun
She starting now
She number one

Once she see the sauce
Now ya know she gotta have it

Turning good girls
Like you into a savage
Ohhhh ohh ohh

We ain't doing nothing basic
We gon' overdue it 'til
These motherfuckers hate it
I'ma put it in you
And then I want you to take it
And flip it so good
Everybody wanna taste it
You can tell that you my favorite
I give you the gas and
Now you burning up the pavement
If you ever leave
I'ma probably have to chase it
It took too long to make it
And now I can't replace it

Oh no, My god
What have you done
She doin' things
She never done
I gave her game
She having fun
She starting now
She number one
Once she see the sauce
