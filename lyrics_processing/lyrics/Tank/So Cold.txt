This R&B money
And we gon' let it ride, yeah

I stand accused of fuck boy behavior
I bailed out when I promised I was gon' save ya
Man down, I didn't man up 'til later
Now I'm serving these apologies like a waiter, look at me now

Needing you back, down on my knees
Sprite in my cup, you got me on lean
Drink on the way, so I can cope
Smoke in the air, I don't even smoke

But it's so cold, so cold, so cold
So cold, so cold, so cold
So cold, so cold, so cold, need you in my life
So cold, so cold, so cold, ooh yeah
Out in these streets without you
Up in these streets without you
Out in these streets without you, baby
Up in these streets without you, so cold
You might also like
Maybe I deserve it, you been out here twerking
Having fun, I see the 'gram, can't help from lurking
Oh god, now you drinking more, you letting them boys, show you around
While you going up, I'm going through, waiting around

Needing you back, down on my knees
Sprite in my cup, you got me on lean
Drink on the way, so I can cope
Smoke in the air, I don't even smoke

But it's so cold, so cold, so cold
So cold, so cold, so cold
So cold, so cold, so cold, need you in my life
So cold, so cold, so cold, ooh yeah
Out in these streets without you

I bought a Wraith on the first
Filled it up with all my hoes
Thought it would kill all the hurt
But it made it worse, shoulda known
Temporary fixes, temporary bitches
Ain't none of 'em really love me
Only you can fix it
That's what I've been missin'
I'm just needing you to touch me
I'm doin' things that I never do
I'm gettin' high just to fly above
All of them things that were never true
Lyin' to you wasn't worth enough, no, no
Lyin' to you wasn't worth enough, no, no, no, no, no, no
But it's so cold, so cold, so cold
So cold, so cold, so cold
So cold, so cold, so cold, (I'm freezing
So cold, so cold, so cold, ooh yeah
Out in these streets without you
Out in these streets without you, ballin' ain't the same
Up in these streets without you, hittin' corners, switchin' lanes
Out in these streets without you, baby, shit feels so lame
Out on these streets without you, need you, so cold, need you, need you
So cold without you here
So cold without you near
I don't wanna live
