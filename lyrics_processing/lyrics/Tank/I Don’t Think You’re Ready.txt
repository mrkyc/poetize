Girl, get facedown for a minute
Let me go down and change your mind
I wanna take you to your limit
I wanna go where you don't
Make a decision, baby
You got the fire that I'm looking for, baby
I wanna be your blessing
Get it over here now

Come take a seat, put some' else on my tongue
You know I'm a freak, I'ma lick it while you cum
I'ma do some things, have you screaming, "Oh, Lord"
I can fuck you right if you let go, baby, you know

I can teach you lessons, girl, if that's what you want
Girl, you gon' get tested 'cause you think that you grown
I'ma keep you guessing, baby, stay on your toes
This ain't your profession and it's starting to show (I don't think you're ready)
I can teach you lessons, girl, if that's what you want
Girl, you gon' get tested 'cause you think that you grown
I'ma keep you guessing, baby, stay on your toes
This ain't your profession and it's starting to show (I don't think you're ready)

Girl, get facedown for a minute
Spread that shit out just one more time
This is the sex I invented
They think they know, but they don't
I need permission, baby
I'm more than willing to make you go crazy
I wanna be your blessing, get it over here, oh

Come take a seat, put some' else on my tongue
You know I'm a freak, I'ma lick it while you cum
I'ma do some things, have you screaming, "Oh, Lord"
