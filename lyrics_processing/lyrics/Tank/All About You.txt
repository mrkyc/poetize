I don't wanna lie to you no more
There's too many women up in they feelings
Now they gone snitching, yeah
I don't wanna lie to you no more
I know what's been missing
All I been giving to them other bitches

DM popping, I be responding, damn I'm so lame
They be screenshotting what I be talking, no you up on game
That was the old me, not the new me, tryna make a new name
I'll give it all up for you, fuck all the fortune, fuck all the fame

I promise that it's all about you
And this gon' be all about you
I promise that it's all about you
Say oh, I promise that it's all about you
And this gon' be all about you
I promise that I'mma make a truce
Say oh, these are the times
That I realise that I'm nothing without you
Oh, promise that it's all about you

I'm tryna find a way to get rid of all the bullshit
I don't know what to say so you forget it all and I don't lose shit
All of the media is the reason we keep going through shit
So I gotta give it up cause I be fucked if I ever lose this

Remember the time I promise I told you we would last forever?
Remember the time I told you we'd always be together?
Remember the time when we were sitting, listening to baby girl?
I told you, you was one in a million and you would always be my world
