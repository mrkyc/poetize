After everything you admitted to me
And I'm sitting here tryna find a way to forget somehow
Cuz I'm feeling like you cut me too deep
Girl I blame myself cuz I told you ; lay it on the line
Never thought that you would lay it that way
Never thought you had so much to say
Never thought that I'd see the day
Where we almost cross the line between love and hate
Are you sure you told me everything (everything now)
Even though it hurts I'm listening
I'm tryna take it like a man, and halfway understand
Being hurt wasn't part of the plan

It was a heartbreaker
Hearin' things I didn't wanna hear from her
Now I'm thinking 'bout the things I did for her
Glad I never ever had no kids with her, this heartbreaker
Cuz I damn near swallowed my tongue (when she said it to me)
My heart started pounding like a drum (when she said it to me)
Thought the truth was something I could take
But it wasn't supposed to feel like a heartbreak
Now the fact of the matter is, I thought that I'd be cool
(After everything you admitted to me)
It's takin' everything of me, not to put my hands on you

Girl I blame myself cuz I told you 2 lay it on the line
Never thought that you would lay it that way
Never thought you had so much to say
Never thought that I'd see the day
When we'd almost cross the line betweeen love and hate
Are you sure you told me everything (don't need no surprises)
Even though it hurts, I'm listening (I'm hurtin', I'm tryna hide it)
I'm tryna take it like a man, and halfway understand
Being hurt wasn't part of the plan

I've had my share of broken hearts, but girl you took it too far
Cuz What you did to me was so unpredictable
Yeah you told me, but I wish i didn't know
Now Why you wanna go and break me down (down, way down)
It's like I'm lost, never to be found
And it ain't like I'm six feet under ground (ground)
You didn't have to tell me cuz
I damn near swallowed my tongue (when she said it to me)
My heart started pounding like a drum (when she said it to me)
Thought the truth was something I could take
But it wasn't supposed to feel like a heartbreak
