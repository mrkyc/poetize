Got you shakin',  screaming aloud, I'ma fool
Make my face your chair, leakin' everywhere
Ride it out, I don't care what you do

Every time I lick it, you be losing it
These young boys didn't know what to do with it
You got it all on my face, I love the way that it tastes
When you put it all on my plate
It won't go to waste

That's what you get everyday
When you fuckin' with me
Fuckin' with me
That's what you get everyday
When you fuckin' with me
Fuckin' with me
That's what you get everyday

You got the right to be selfish
For all of them nights you was helpless
Them mornings too, let's make it breakfast
