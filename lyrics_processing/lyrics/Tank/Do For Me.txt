Spend this money on you
That's what a nigga like to do
If it ain't my shit than a girl don't want it
And if it my shit then a girl won't flaunt it
I'll make you feel like a queen
You pick out anything I put the bag on it
We don't even check the tag on it
I'm holdin' they should throw a flag on it
I don't trip that I'm your paperboy
I just wanna know what's coming back for it
I could make a few requests but I'd rather not have to ask you to

Put in work
I don't mind a double tax if you
Put in work
Make a nigga double back when you
Put in work
Girl this ain't no game I really blew it all for you

What'chu gon' do for me
(Meeeeeeee yeaaah)
What'chu gon' do for me
(Meeeeeeee yeaaah)
What'chu gon' do for me
(Meeeeeeee yeaaah)
What'chu gon' do for me girl
(Meeeeeeee yeaaah)

Condos that sit on the beach
Foreign leather just to fit all your passports
Drivin' your Benz like a Nascar
I plan to get what you ask for
Run up a check like it's nothing, girl
It's only trickin' if it's not'cha girl
I could make a few requests but I'd rather not have to ask you to

Put in work
I don't mind a double tax if you
Put in work
Make a nigga double back when you
Put in work

When I take you on the town
You be burnin it down
Now I think it's some things maybe I do deserve
What'chu gon' do for me

I'ma keep a duffel bag on me just in-case you really wanna ball out
We gon' have enough to plan any paper game a nigga wanna call out
I been doin' my thang for you you should get in me enough to boss out
Or get tossed out

What'chu gon' do for me
