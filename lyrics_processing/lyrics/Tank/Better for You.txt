I'ma get this right
If it's the last thing I do, ooh

All she ask for, occasional roses
That romance drug; give it in doses
I could hear you, but I didn't listen
I was near you, now you've gone missing

How could I not promise you perfection?
I'm gon' have to answer to my reflection
I'm realising there's way too much on the line, oh

I could be better for you, I could be better for you
I could be better for you, I could be better for you
I could be better for you, I could be better for you
I could be better for you, I could be better for you
I know I ain't close to the man
You need me to be, I see
I could be better for you, I could be better for you
I could be better for you, I could be better for you

She said, don't share what's mine, make me feel special
I wanna feel proud when I stand next to you
Too accessible, they think they can grab you
Be respectable or those bitches can have you
You might also like
How could I not promise you perfection?
I'm gon' have to answer to my reflection
I'm realising there's way too much on the line, yeah

I could be better for you, I could be better for you
I could be better for you, I could be better for you
I could be better for you, I could be better for you
I could be better for you, I could be better for you
I know I ain't close to the man
You need me to be, I see
I could be better for you, I could be better for you
I could be better for you, I could be better for you

What profit a man to gain the world but lose his soul?
How you gon' cheat your main girl but treat a hoe?
This might be the illest, realist shit I ever wrote
Trust me, I'm taking notes
'Cause you deserve affection
You deserve a whole lot more protection
I'm realising there's way to much on the line, oh

I could be better for you, I could be better for you
I could be better for you, I could be better for you
I could be better for you, I could be better for you
I could be better for you, I could be better for you
I know I ain't close to the man
You need me to be, I see
I could be better for you, I could be better for you
I could be better for you, I could be better for you
I can be better for you baby
I know you've heard it all before
I know I saw it all
Give me one more chance, ohAnnotations to be deleted:
