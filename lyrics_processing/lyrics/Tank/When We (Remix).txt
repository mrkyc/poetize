When we (Oh)
When we (When we)
Mmm
When we (Yeah)
Go (Trigga)

I love the way you fuck me
I love the way you fuck me
But you don't understand its way more than fucking
When I fuck you
I would cross the ocean for you
Stroking through the ocean for you
And then I rub the lotion on you
You got a lot of lotion on you
I want to see the moon shine on you
I gotta see the moon shine on you
A little more lotion on you
Tryna take my time on you
Baby, tell me

Who came to make sweet love? Not me
Who came to kiss and hug? Not me
Who came to beat it up? Rocky
And don't use those hands to put up that gate and stop me

Hit it on the stairs, didn't make it to the room
Had that coochie leakin' all on my Gucci shoes
Kissin' on your neck, you told me that I'm too deep
Need to tell your ex to leave you alone, he a creep
Ass up, face down
Ride me like a pony
These niggas so phony
Treat you like a trophy
You know I pick up when the phone ring
You know I go deep 'til I make you scream
You say my dick game amazin'
Ooh, D-Game on strong
Fuck it up all night long
Beat it up, get piped down
Ooh, D-Game on strong
Fuck it up all night long
Beat it up, get piped down

Face down, ass up
I'ma pull all of my face in
You cumin' while I keep tastin'
Now I'm breakin' in, you a big girl and you taken
I'ma lay in, I think I love you, I'm sayin' it
It's the kind of fuckin' that'll make you
Make me number one on your list
It's the kind of fuckin' that'll make you question
Who you've been fuckin' with
You got plenty miles and baggage
But I could still make you a savage
Sponsor you, make you the baddest
Have you screamin' out "you can have it" when we

When we fuck (Oh, oh)
