Can't lose girl
You're my prize possession, heaven know
I would rather die than let you go, girl
Can't describe this feeling in my soul
And I can't help but stare you got that glow

My star, my star, my star
Up high, but not to far
Only you, you're my star

My heart skips a beat, I'm thinking 'bout it now
Girl I'd be a fool if don't keep you around
Cause baby girl you light up my world
