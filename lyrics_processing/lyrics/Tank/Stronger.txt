Oh, yeah, yeah

Did you see these scars?
Trying to eat through this flesh
Making its way to my heart
Wanting to destroy what's left
What you saw, was it the start
Of destruction at it's best?
Is that why you appeared?
'Cause of what you felt

'Cause I could feel your love
It's pulling me back
Brick by brick
Your love is building me up
Your strength so perfect, yeah

Now, look at me, I'm stronger
Than I've ever been, ayy
Where I am's no longer
Where I've been, ayy
Now, look at me, I'm stronger
Than I've ever been, oh
I'm stronger
And it's all
All because of you
All because of you
You might also like
Wait 'til you see my smile
Wait 'til you see what's next
Wait 'til you see this light
That's burning through my chest
Ayy, and watch how high I fly
How fast this feeling spreads oh-oh-oh
Never ever would have thought
This would all be available to me again

Oh, but then I felt your love
It's pulling me back
Brick by brick
Your love is building me up
Your strength so perfect, yeah

Now, look at me, I'm stronger
Than I've ever been, ayy
Where I am's no longer
Where I've been, ayy
Now, look at me, I'm stronger
Than I've ever been
Yeah-eah, yeah, yeah
I'm stronger
And it's all
All because of...
You've taken everywhere I've been
And promised that I never have to go there again, again
Girl, this time we gon' get away

'Cause I'm stronger
Than I've ever been, ayy
Where I am's no longer
Where I've been, ayy
Now, look at me, I'm stronger
Than I've ever been
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ah!
I'm stronger
And it's all
All because of you
All because of you!
I'm stronger

She walked out, didn't leave your boy wit' anything
But I'm stronger
I'm still missing pieces after everything
But I'm stronger
Can't believe it 'cause she said she'd never leave
But I'm stronger
But if she'd never left, I would have never seen
That I'm stronger
You made me, you made me stronger
You made me, you made me stronger (Made me)
You made me, you made me stronger (Me, me)
Strong, strong
You took all the pieces that I didn't need and now I'm free
You made me, you made me stronger
You made me, you made me stronger
You made me, you made me stronger
Strong, strong
Stronger
Stronger
