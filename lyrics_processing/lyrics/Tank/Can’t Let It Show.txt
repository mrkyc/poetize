How did I lose you? (How did I lose you?)
How did I blow that? How can we go back?
Why did I not choose you? Ooh-ooh
Instead of a good time, I wasted your good time

I should've been everything I promised
I should've not had to learn it from this

I know it's emotional, but you're not emotional, she said

I should be crying but I just can't let it show
I should be crying but I can't stop thinking
All the things you should've said that you never said
All the things you should've done that you never did
Always said, "I don't know what I should be feeling"
Oh, darling

I've been stupid, thoughtless
I've been useless, heartless
I've been violating and thinking it wasn't ever gonna catch up
I wasn't ever gonna 'fess up, and that's real
