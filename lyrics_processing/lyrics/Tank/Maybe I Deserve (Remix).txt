(The truth)
Hey, hey
No, no, no, no, no
Maybe I deserve to wonder who's callin' so damn late
For you to say I'm trippin'
Just a homie from Upstate
(You said it's just a homie)
Don't he know it's one o'clock in the morning
You say it's cool, baby it's cool
Maybe I deserve for you to say he's coming into town
(Later on this evening)
And he was just wonderin' if you and him could hang out
I don't like it, but I know I gotta trust you
It ain't cool, 'cuz I know it's true
Maybe I deserve
For you to go out and find some other guy
Maybe I deserve
For you to stay out with him all night
Maybe I deserve
For you to do all the things, I did to you
Maybe I deserve
(Oh yeah)
Maybe I deserve
(Oh yeah)
Maybe I deserve
For you to go out and find some other guy
Maybe I deserve
For you to stay out with him all night
Maybe I deserve
For you to do all the things, I did to you
Maybe I deserve
(Oh yeah)
Maybe I deserve
(Oh yeah)
Maybe I deserve for you to put on that sexy dress
For me to ask you, Who the hell you tryin' to impress
(The hell you tryin' to impress?)
For you to laugh it off like it ain't nothin'
I know it's somethin'
Maybe, just maybe
Maybe I deserve to sit at home and wonder where you are
Is he kissin' you, touchin' you, holdin' you, what?
Take a drink, to help ease my mind
I wanna be mad
(Wanna be)
After all those times
(After all those times)
Maybe I deserve
For you to go out and find some other guy
Maybe I deserve
For you to stay out with him all night
Maybe I deserve
For you to do all the things, I did to you
Maybe I deserve
(Oh yeah)
Maybe I deserve
(Oh yeah)
Maybe I deserve
For you to go out and find some other guy
Maybe I deserve
For you to stay out with him all night
Maybe I deserve
For you to do all the things, I did to you
Maybe I deserve
(Oh yeah)
Maybe I deserve
(Oh yeah)
Maybe I deserve for me to ask you where you been
(Where the hell you been)
Maybe I deserve for you to say, I better stop trippin'
(Don't trip)
Maybe I deserve to grab your neck until you let me know
(You better tell me somethin')
Maybe I deserve for you to run cryin'
Cryin' out the door
Maybe I deserve to grab my coat and chase you down the street
(Don't leave)
Maybe I deserve to say it's not you, it's my own insecurity
Maybe I deserve for you to say "Yes I cheated on you"
(Baby don' told me)
(Maybe I deserve)
And I won't care 'cuz after all I put you through
Maybe I deserve, deserve girl, to be mistreated sometimes
Maybe I deserve to even be lied to sometimes
Maybe I deserve
Maybe, maybe you should go cheat on me
Maybe I should sit and wait by the phone
(Maybe I should)
'Cause I don' paged you about three or four times
Girl I know, girl I know what I put you through baby
I put you through hell
And I don't get less
I don't get less
I don't get less
See we men can't take another man pleasing our women
Oh no, no, we can't even stand waiting by the phone
But we do the same shit, oh damn, oh damn
I know I deserve it, but right now
