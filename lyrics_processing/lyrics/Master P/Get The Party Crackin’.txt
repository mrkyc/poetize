We pop bottles when we party, y'all
And we live every day like it's Mardi Gras
Find us in the club about 30 deep
And we parking lot-pimpin' when is time to creep
Pockets on swole, but no, I'm no Stunna
We do it big, put 30s on the Hummer
Your bitch chose me, call me the plumber
Slip me the number, got the beat from Drumma
Show me what you workin' with, take it to the floor
I ain't Lil Jon, but you can Get Low
From the club to the muthafuckin' car
You still thirsty? We can take it to the bar
Then drop it like it's hot, just take her to the spot
You in the Army, shawty, shake what you got
These thugs hella deep in the club
The New No Limit; nigga, we don't give a fuck!

We pack heat, 'cause these streets are real
Cops pull us over for these spinning wheels
OK, the party don't stop
Yeah, the New No Limit; ma, we all so hot
Drinks on me and I'm buyin' out the bar
In a minute we can leave and start tryin' out my car
Your girlfriend cute, but you right there

Shawty wanna ride, hang wit a thug
 just stripped in the back of the club
Yeah, my peeps done came in
The burner by side, yeah, the heat done came in

Cuz if she know Shocker, then she already know what's up
Like a blind person, shawty, look, u gotta feel me
Stop playing with these little boys, get with some real Gs
While they tryin' to go, go half on a sack
Me and P ballin', we tryin' to go half on Sak
Treat girls like cornrows, they go straight to the back
And after I'm done, I go straight to the 'Lac

I'm the lil' nigga from the Westside, eyes wide, man
P got me rollin', Bentley controllin'
Find us in the VIP
We do it big in the 213
And them vogues gon' hop and them girls gon' pop
If it wasn't for these Soldiers, I'd still be on the block
Like Game, I'm rowdy, nigga
And I roll with a bunch of fuckin' 'Bout It niggas
What up Crips, Bloods, hustlers, thugs
Whoa ma, I see what you're doin'
