Woke one morning, tears in my eyes
The feds kicked in the door and caught me and my baby by surprise
He got high, but they didn't find no dope
They said it was conspiracy just cause a hater said so
Now we might do time in the penn
But the state dont have a case without witnesses and no evidence
So I guess once again that it's on
But I really wish the haters would just leave us alone

Thinkin about you boy
Thinkin about you girl
Do what you gotta do boy
Do what you gotta do girl
Thinkin about you boy
Thinkin about you girl
Thinkin about you
I'm thinkin about you

My enemies hate me money can't make me
Bitches can't break me the feds can't take me
Give me four or five months and I'm out
It must be love momma put up the house
And the game won't change nigga still the same nigga
Real thangs and little change nigga
But um, I gotta do what I gotta
Even if it take us slangin CD's and narcotics
I gotta little sware when the penetentiary
Cause on these streets are heaven or hell
Now picture me balling
I love No Limit like sex and don't plan on falling
You might also like

I'm thinkin about you boy
So do what you gotta do girl
So do what you gotta do boy
I'm thinkin about you girl
Thinkin about you boy
I'm thinkin about you
Thinkin about you

Motherfucking right I'm a take it how it come like a soldier
TRU click TRU bitch go to war for ya
In the kitchen at the stove cooking up the product
Cause fiends love it most when you give it to em rocked up
Chopped up bitches in the game that was talking
But they didn't know hoes got them feds stalking
Playing peekaboo, plotting on the front door
But all the goin find is some ghetto dope
So come on, so would you just let a bitch live
Stack my ends and raise my kids
Ride my benz, flow my ice
Teaching all them ghetto bitches how to live this life
Why y'all fools trying to knock this bitch
It's the tank, so you know you can't stop this
Watch this young black family take this whole industry
And run it, thinkin bout you while we done it
Thinkin about you boy
Thinkin about you girl
Do what you gotta do boy
