I don't know where I'm going to
But selling dope is the only thing I know how to do
Damn, ****, you can't handle that dank?
Time tonight

I'm deep up in the game, I can't sleep at night
And mama prayin' because she know her boy ain't livin' right
And when I die, they say I'm goin' out by the gunsmoke
'Cause I refuse to be broke up in this ghetto
See, I be trippin' on life 'cause life's a damn trip
And when I leave the house, you know I'm carryin' a extra clip
See in the 90's, things are gon', gon' change
I never thought I'd grow up to be the dope mane
But in reality, I guess I damn lost it all
'Cause just the other day, I put my brother's name on the wall
Rest in peace, yeah, they done killed him, G
I know one day somebody gon' to try to kill the P
And if they do, I guess it was my time to go
But if they miss, you'll be readin' about some dead folks
In other words, can you feel me?
And if you from my hood, you know the ghetto's tryna kill me

The ghetto's tryna kill me
They might send me to the pen, but doin' time, that don't scare me
The ghetto's tryna kill me
They might send me to the pen, but doin' time, that don't scare me

I'm sellin' dope, and my baby mama, she want me to quit
But I can't 'cause the game give me dividends
See, in the game, hella my partners, they depend on me
So when I go out, I'm goin' out like my dead homies
Forty G's, two keys in the crackhouse
Po-po's on my drawers, you know the P's gon' smash out
Never trust nobody, can't even trust my chick
And when my kids grow up they know their daddy's a lunitic
Driveby's in the ghetto happen all night long
Call me Master P, killer, call me Al Capone
'Cause when I die, they probably won't remember me
But while I'm here, them marks know they can't fade the P
You seeing fatal when you messin with this dope click
But if you run up on the P, you get your wig split
For the jealous suckers that's out to kill me
I'ma reverse the game, partna, can you feel me?

The ghetto's tryna kill me
They might send me to the pen, but doin' time, that don't scare me
The ghetto's tryna kill me
They might send me to the pen, but doin' time, that don't scare me

I lost two brothers within the year and I can't even cope
I try to go straight, but I still end up sellin' dope
Reminiscing up on my childhood, and it ain't the same
I never thought my occupation was gon' be the dope game
Two keys a day, you never seen so much coke
Three o'clock up in the mornin', choppin' up dope
Reachin' for my gat soon as I hear the slightest noise
Just comin' from a funeral, and it got me paranoid
Havin' flashbacks of this fool I smoked with my gat
He livin', if he's real, he'll be comin' back
But if I'm goin' out, I'm goin' out with a bang
Suckers jealous 'cause young Silkk ridin' on them thangs
Having visions of how I'm going to die, G
Will I die up in this game or die in my sleep?
That's why I pack a piece, y'all should feel me
I ain't paranoid, I know this ghetto's tryna kill me
The ghetto's tryna kill me
They might send me to the pen, but doin' time, that don't scare me
The ghetto's tryna kill me
They might send me to the pen, but doin' time, that don't scare me
The ghetto's tryna kill me
They might send me to the pen, but doin' time, that don't scare me
The ghetto's tryna kill me
They might send me to the pen, but doin' time, that don't scare me

The ghetto's tryna kill me
The ghetto's tryna kill me
The ghetto's tryna kill me
And if you real, I know y'all can feel me
Yeah, like my partna Too $hort said
"Get in where you fit in"
