Look at all these haters, surroundin' me every day
Hatin' on a baller, but they can't stop my pay
Stop all this hatin', I can't take it no more
I'm just tryna get mine, you best get yours, so what you hatin' for

Pop the locks on the Benz, steal his keys
Too high to see his own enemies
Seen his baby mama -tears with a short skirt
His last ride was in a car, I mean a black hearse
His friend took his life for the mighty dollar
Then ran through the alley must've been a coward
No more gettin 'em up, like in the old days
Homies squab with Mack 10s and AKs
That's why I roll by myself I mean my lonely
'Cause haters be all up on me
Tryna sniff you out for your cheddar and your cheese
And the same niggas wanna blow on your weed
Set you up for a caper
Don't wanna see you make no money, then take ya
And try to figure out how to get what you got
'Cause haters be the same niggas on your spot

Look at all these haters, surroundin' me every day
Hatin' on a baller, but they can't stop my pay
Stop all the hatin', I can't take it no more
I'm just tryna get mine, you best get yours, so what you hatin' for
You might also like
How do hatin' get started? It's started by the jealous people
And they get mad over the things you have and the things they'll never have
Tell me if you hustle, it really ain't hard to get
You can get yours, I got mine, so stay out my mix
I heard you spreading rumors, I'm really not impressed
I tell you only one time with my scrilla, fool, don't mess

I'm only in with a few 'cause these bitch-made niggas is actors
See I done had to many gun-ins, run-ins with these ass backwards
Non-packers, I'm strapped like P or C
Just in case these niggas after me, capture me
Forget I'm goin' out with a blast
And I put that on some cash, I'm standin' last
For some ass, y'all young crazed punks are trippin'
Don't hate me nigga, and go 'head and credit my dippin'
I'm admittin' that I'm not only on the twat
But I know I got stopped, on the cock
It's understood that I'm not one of the best young playas that ever lived
But I got some advice to give, and that is

Look at all these haters, surroundin' me every day
Hatin' on a baller, but they can't stop my pay
Stop all the hatin', I can't take it no more
I'm just tryna get mine, you best get yours, so what you hatin' for
I wonder why they hatin for? Probably 'cause we got G's
All mad 'cause we makin' moves, 'cause we got keys
But uh... really I can't save 'em
'Cause truly you need haters up on you to know you's a motherfuckin' playa
And I'mma try to make y'all kill me in a matter of lines
I got friends that can turn to enemies in a matter of time
And when truly, I know my niggas nationwide can feel me
When I say truly the ghettos tryna kill me
But keep my eyes up on my enemies, I gotta watch my friends
See keep, my hands on choppas when I'm ridin' the Benz
Get off of yo ass, get out and get something
Don't worry about how I got mines
Instead of you worrying pointing your finger, talkin bout "whats not mine"
And feel me, It kills me, to discuss it
Why? When I got a few G's, They'll try to rob me
But the white man got a million they won't touch it
They smile in your face and talkin shit behind your back
But I just can't call it
Catch me the other day saying I still owe G's and I'm still ballin'

Look at all these haters, surroundin' me every day
Hatin' on a baller, but they can't stop my pay
Stop all the hatin', I can't take it no more
I'm just tryna get mine, you best get yours, so what you hatin' for
Look at all these haters, surroundin' me every day
Hatin' on a baller, but they can't stop my pay
Stop all the hatin', I can't take it no more
I'm just tryna get mine, you best get yours, so what you hatin' for
