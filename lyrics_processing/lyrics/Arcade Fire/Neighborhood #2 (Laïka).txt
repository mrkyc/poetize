Alexander, our older brother
Set out for a great adventure
He tore our images out of his pictures
He scratched our names out of all his letters

Our mother should have
Just named you Laika

Come on Alex, you can do it
Come on Alex, there's nothing to it
If you want something, don't ask for nothing
If you want nothing, don't ask for something

Our mother should have
Just named you Laika
It's for your own good
It's for the neighborhood
The neighborhood

Our older brother bit by a vampire
For a year we caught his tears in a cup
And now we're gonna make him drink it
Come on Alex, don't die or dry up

When daddy comes home you always start a fight
So the neighbors can dance in the police disco lights
The police disco lights

Now the neighbors can dance (The police)
Now the neighbors can dance (Disco lights)
Now the neighbors can dance (The police)
Now the neighbors can dance (Disco lights)
