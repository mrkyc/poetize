Sleeping is giving in
No matter what the time is
Sleeping is giving in
So lift those heavy eyelids
People say that you'll die
Faster than without water
But we know it's just a lie
Scare your son, scare your daughter

People say that your dreams
Are the only things that save you
Come on baby, in our dreams
We can live our misbehavior

Every time you close your eyes (Lies! Lies!)
Every time you close your eyes (Lies! Lies!)
Every time you close your eyes (Lies! Lies!)
Every time you close your eyes (Lies! Lies!)
Every time you close your eyes
Every time you close your eyes
Every time you close your eyes
Every time you close your eyes

Hiding from your brothers

Come on hide your lovers

People say that you'll die
Faster than without water
But I know it's just a lie
Scare your son, scare your daughter
Scare your son, scare your daughter
