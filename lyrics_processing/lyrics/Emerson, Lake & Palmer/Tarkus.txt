Has the dawn ever seen your eyes?
Have the days made you so unwise?
Realize, you are

Had you talked to the winds of time
Then you'd know how the waters rhyme
Taste of wine

How can you know where you've been?
In time, you'll see the sign
And realize your sin
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)


Will you know how the seed is sown?
All your time has been overgrown
Never known

Have you walked on the stones of years?
When you speak, is it you that hears?
Are your ears full?
You can't hear anything at all



The preacher said a prayer, save every single hair on his head
He's dead
The minister of hate had just arrived too late to be spared
Who cared?

The weaver in the web that he made

The pilgrim wandered in, committing every sin that he could
So good
The cardinal of grief was set in the belief he'd be saved
From the grave
The weaver in the web that he made


The high priest took a blade to bless the ones that prayed
And all obeyed
The messenger of fear is slowly growing, nearer to the time
A sign

The weaver in the web that he made

A bishop rings a bell A cloak of darkness fell across the ground
Without a sound
The silent choir sing and in their silence bring jaded sound
Harmonic ground

The weaver in the web that he made



Clear the battlefield and let me see
All the profit from our victory
You talk of freedom, starving children fall
Are you deaf when you hear the season's call?

Were you there to watch the earth be scorched?
Did you stand beside the spectral torch?
Now the leaves of sorrow turned their face
Scattered on the ashes of disgrace


Every blade is sharp, the arrows fly
Where the victims of your armies lie
Were the blades of grass and arrows rain
Then there'd be no sorrow, be no pain
