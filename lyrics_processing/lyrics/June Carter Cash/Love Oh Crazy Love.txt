When spring is in the air
A fever starts a spreading
But we don't seem to care
Love, oh, crazy love
Love, oh, crazy love
That's what we call this mangy germ
Love, oh, crazy love
What is love, Carl?
Why June, that's aching heart and burning desire
Put them together and what have you got? Heartburn
Ain't it the truth, ain't it the truth
Oh, it terrible
You sing a verse now
I saw a little mugwump
Mugwump?
A sitting on a tree
Until he saw a female
He was as happy as could be
Love, oh, crazy love
Love, oh, crazy love
And now she's pecking him to death
Love, oh, crazy love
You might also likeJune, what in the world is a mug wump?
It's a little bird that sits on the fence with its mug on one side and its wump on the other side
I guess I asked for that one, didn't I?
You sure did
Well, I'm going to sing about the rabbits now
Alright
I had 2 little rabbits
They never got along
Until they heard me singing
A silly, old love song
Love, oh, crazy love
Love, oh, crazy love
Now I got 16 more to feed
Love, oh, crazy love
Let's us say a poem
Alright, June. I'll say the first line
The rabbit's nose is shining, I'll you as a friend
That's cause the powder puff is on the wrong end
Ain't it the truth, huh?
A bachelor he was singing
That was me
And a minding his own way
Wasn't it true
And then I came a prancing by
And I wanted him to play
Love, oh, crazy love
Love, oh, crazy love
And now she's got me buckled down
Love, oh, crazy love
I shot a bachelor for kissing me once
Why? Was he the first one that ever tried to kiss you?
No, but he was the first one that ever tried it with his mouth full of tobacco juice
Well, good for you
It was a tragedy
It was, huh?
It was terrible
I thought you'd have like it. I'll sing now
You'd better or I'll knock the fire out of you
I thought I had the will power
Enough to stay at home
But every time I see a girl
I can't leave her alone
No
Love, oh, crazy love
Love, oh, crazy love
I'd better never catch you, boy
