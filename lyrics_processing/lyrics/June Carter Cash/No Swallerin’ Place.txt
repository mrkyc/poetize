Only one thing wrong with a pretty good song
'Cause a pretty good song goes a long
And a long and a long and a long and a long
And a long and a long and a long and a long
'Til it gets me red in the face
'Cause it ain't got no swallerin' place
I can finish a sack of cracker jacks in fifteen seconds flat
And still keep the conversation running fair
I can kiss my darling sweetheart and hold it half an hour
And I ain't half dead when I come up for air
But darn, this song it's a pretty good song
Only one thing wrong with a pretty good song
'Cause a pretty good song goes a long and a long
And a long and a long and a long and a long
And a long and a long and a long and a long
Like a doggone marathon race
'Cause it ain't got no swallerin' place
Here's that tune it's a pretty good tune
But I just ain't built like a rubber balloon
It's a pretty good tune and a croon
And a croon and a croon and a croon
And a croon and a croon and a croon
And croon and croon
And I can't keep up with the pace

Now I can finish a sack of cracker jacks in fifteen seconds flat
And still keep the conversation running fair
When I kiss my loving sweetheart, I can hold it half an hour
And I ain't half dead when I come up for air
But darn, this song it's a pretty good song
Only one thing wrong with a pretty good song
'Cause a pretty good song goes a long and a long
And a long and a long and a long and a long
And a long and a long and a long and a long
Like a doggone marathon race
