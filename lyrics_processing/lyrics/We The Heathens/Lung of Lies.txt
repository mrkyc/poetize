We have an obligation to every last victim of this illegal aggression because all of this carnage has been done in our name. Since World War 2, 90% of the casualties of war are on our own civilians, a third of them children. Our victims have done nothing to us
From Palestine to Afghanistan, to Iraq, to Somalia, to wherever our next target may be, their murders are not collateral damage, they are the nature of modern warfare
They don't hate us because of our freedoms. They hate us because every day we are funding and committing crimes against humanity. The so called "war on terror" is a cover for our military aggression to be in control of the resources of Western Asia
Every one of us, every one of us must keep demanding, keep fighting, keep sundering, keep clouding, keep speaking, keep struggling until justice is served. No justice, no peace

Is there anger in your heart? and an itching in your brain? we want!
Cough out the lung of lies, gasp the deaths decay
Distracted mass, like siblings, affray, You dead!
Snort up the whole headline leading you astray
Outside of your world, thrives their reality, vicious!
Entrails of the innocent infant wiped clear from the slate
In the deep sea, they will drown, in the rubble they will burn, Order!
Ignore the blood rising behind the dam to burst

So long distracted by our petty differences
On whom will they wage the final war? On us!
Your suited idol a double headed serpent
Under the forked tongue promise sleep
Wake to defeat

Dispatched, beheaded

Fortify, tear it down
All regimes coming down
Rulers bleed, tyranny
