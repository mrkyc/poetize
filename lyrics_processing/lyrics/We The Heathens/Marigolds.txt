Happiness is just a myth and were all stuck in the middle of it
The kind of place where we would talk
Like the train tracks, we would walk
And it's like water under the bridge (Water under the bridge)
Or those sticky notes you'd leave on the fridge (Sticky notes you'd leave on the fridge)
Kind of like the rainstorms out on the porch (Rainstorms out on the porch)
Or those 4 AM talks in the court

And I hope I get these last words fucking right
Because I fucked up countless times to even try
And I doubt these marigolds will help the blight
But I brought them here for you to have tonight
You to have tonight

Come back to me my darling, please
I've been running around the train tracks for you
So I will hold this IV 'til it drains the life from me
Because life is too damn cruel without company
Because this world is just a grave without you to see

And it's like water under the bridge (Water under the bridge)
Or those sticky notes you'd leave on the fridge (Sticky notes you'd leave on the fridge)
Kind of like the rainstorms out on the porch (Rainstorms out on the porch)
Or those 4 AM talks in the court
You might also like
And I hope I didn't lose my only chance to make it right
But your eyes are telling me otherwise
There's plenty of regrets that stand between you and I
And I doubt these marigolds will mend the time
Mend the time

Come back to me my darling, please
I've been running around the train tracks for you
So I will hold this IV 'til it drains the life from me
Because life is too damn cruel without company
Because this world is just a grave without you to see

My marigolds will never bloom, never bloom
My marigolds will never bloom, never bloom
My marigolds will never bloom, never bloom
My marigolds will never bloom, never bloom
My marigolds will never bloom, never bloom
