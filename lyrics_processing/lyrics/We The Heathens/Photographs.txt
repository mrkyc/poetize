These photographs are all that I have left
A better life inside these rugged memories
But a shoebox won't hold forever
And soon they'll be spillin' out from the seams
I'm not sure what's worse
Losing them, losing it, or losing me

And it seems that all that I live for these days
Are just drunken nights and drunken masquerades
It's a funny game of charades that we play
As we prey on ourselves to find it anyway
We'll put on a show
We'll put on a show for us

And it's hard to live and it's hard to die
And it's hard enough to ask why
But it's easy to forget when all you got
Is a bottle of whiskey and time
And it's hard to live and it's hard to die
And it's hard enough to ask why
But it's easy to forget when all you got
Is a bottle of whiskey and time
You might also like
I spend my days trying to find the ways to numb my brain
To forget about the routines that I hate
So we drink and we fight
And we reminisce about those nights
Where nothing could touch us
Not even the world outside

And it seems that all that I live for these days
Are just drunken nights and drunken masquerades
It's a funny game of charades that we play
As we prey on ourselves to find it anyway
We'll put on a show
We'll put on a show for us
We'll put on a show
We'll put on a show for us

And it's hard to live and it's hard to die
And it's hard enough to ask why
But it's easy to forget when all you got
Is a bottle of whiskey and time
And it's hard to live and it's hard to die
And it's hard enough to ask why
But it's easy to forget when all you got
Is a bottle of whiskey and time
But time is slipping away
(You left us on the curb)
And we're wasting, we're wasting away
(Never to return)
The time is slipping away
Your photographs are gone

And it's hard to live and it's hard to die
And it's hard enough to ask why
But it's easy to forget when all you got
