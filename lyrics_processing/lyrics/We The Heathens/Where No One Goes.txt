The brightest this black sky will get is grey
While I stare out the window as my innards rot away
My bones are aching awful from the cold
And the boring ways of my friends are getting old
Same buzz, same bar, same shit, same town
Same old fucking assholes I hate around
Bottle after bottle til my innards bleed
It's the only thing that kills my haunted sleep

We're getting old and time is short
If this is the mission let's abort
All our lives are like a hellish cell

I just want to be where no one goes
Were the sun is shining when it snows and the pace it never slows
My mind dissolves when I am here
Please give another beer, being stuck is my only fear

There's a plague upon this city and its sickness grows
Every day it's shackles tighten to its host
The very air we breathe a synthetic fume
While factory workers slave in their own tombs
Sore bones, wet boots, broken machines
Are the fuel-drenched perks of the life I lead
Inhale the black, dream of escape
Before the bottle shepherds me to my dying day
You might also like
We're getting old and time is short
If this is the mission let's abort
All our lives are like a hellish cell

I just want to be where no one goes
Were the sun is shining when it snows and the pace it never slows
My mind dissolves when I am here
Please give another beer, being stuck is my only fear
I just want to be where no one goes
Where the sun is shining when it snows and the pace it never slows
And when I'm there I will rejoice, I'll sing out loud til I have no voice!
My own flag of freedom I will hoist!
