What?
Why is she naked?

New car, new clothes, they even got the crease in their Kenneth coles
From head to toe, they're only drowning in their egos
As the sluts strut by all I wanna do is fucking die
A designer dress that's designed to impress dull minds

A whole new face for a wad of money
But identities could never be bought nor sold
So sell your face for some dignity
A life of misery that is painted in your fools gold

So why do we worship their worthless surreal life?
They are not even real
Their silicon smiles will never go for miles
But they'll spread it all around like a disease of plastic vanity

Every billboard sign is vandalized with who you're supposed to be
From jewelry to jokes tantalizing for all who see
From magazines to flat screens I wanna die all over again
A designer life that's designed to just pretend
You might also like
Your brand new things won't keep you company
When all your fascist friends leave you to rot in your new suite
So find yourself a brand new family
One that doesn't revolve around your rapacity

So why do we worship their worthless surreal life
They are not even real
Their silicon smiles will never go for miles
But they'll spread it all around like a disease of plastic vanity

We're drowning (We're drowning)
We're flailing (We're flailing)
We're falling (Falling again)
This planet (This planet)
Is dying (Is dying)
Dissolving (Dissolving from greed)
I hate you (I hate you)
You people (You people)
I hate the entire human race (Entire human race)
Conceded (Conceded)
Defeated (Defeated)
But you can't get grin off of your face
(The grin off of your face)
So why do we worship their worthless surreal life
They are not even real
Their silicon smiles will never go for miles
