Pack your bags, pack your photographs
And take one last look 'cause were never coming back
I believe were calling it quits
Let's take our chances while they're still on the table, and still intact
My heart is pounding in my chest and I'm losing my breath
All the things that I once knew are never coming back
I believe were throwing in the towel
Starting our lives on the back burner

So here's to life, here's to death
Here's to the Mayans and what's left
Here's to the rubble and the trouble
Murders and the thefts
I'm so fucking glad it's over
No more pain to be in debt
So here's to life, here's to death
Here's to the Mayans and what's left
Here's to the rubble and the trouble
Murders and the thefts
I'm so fucking glad it's over
No more pain to be in debt
No more pain to be in debt

Don't hold your breath 'cause were all going down tonight
Like a sinking ship were jumping off for life
With no buoy and no life vest to stay afloat
We might as well make the best of a bad joke
Tell me everything will be alright
There's no apocalypse, no virus, and no war to fight
It's all a hoax or at least I hope
But hopes and dreams never seem to unfold
You might also like
No more movie premieres
No more first dates and no more fears
No more favorite shops down the street
No more victories and no more defeats
Because the end is here to stay
So no more playgrounds for us to play
So ante up 'cause all of our chips are stacked
It's the end of the world and we ain't going back tonight
Going back tonight

So here's to life, here's to death
Here's to the Mayans and what's left
Here's to the rubble and the trouble
Murders and the thefts
I'm so fucking glad it's over
No more pain to be in debt
So here's to life, here's to death
Here's to the Mayans and what's left
Here's to the rubble and the trouble
Murders and the thefts
I'm so fucking glad it's over
No more pain to be in debt
No more pain to be in debt
