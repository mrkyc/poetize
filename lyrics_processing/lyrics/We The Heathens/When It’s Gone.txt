What can we say, this day and age
It all just blends into a blur and subtle haze
'Cause every day is weed and booze and cigarettes
While we're listening to tunes on old cassettes
And as the days turn into years you realize
That the best days of your life are before your eyes
'Cause every day is speed and blow and cigarettes
It's safe to say I love you so with no regrets

And as we wander down the street drunk as fuck
Break a couple lousy laws for a couple bucks
Runaway from the police and reconvene
Underneath the Stewart bridge to be unseen
Make a stop at Innersleeve to visit Mike
Buy some records that you love and some you like
Take 'em home and put them on to listen to
And erase away the stress that is holding you

And in spite of all its flaws
This town is burning down
And we'll dance on its ashes when it's gone
And in spite of all its flaws
This town is burning down
And we'll dance on its ashes when it's gone
You might also like
Take a trip down to The Stank to see a show
With all the local bands that you love and know
And others that have traveled far and few between
Just to watch them play a set that you've never seen
And after that it's to the bar to get fucked up
Golden delicious PBR will fill our cups
Falling from our seats we'll laugh and cause a scene
While the bitter sober prudes call us obscene

And in spite of all its flaws
This town is burning down
And we'll dance on its ashes when it's gone
And in spite of all its flaws
This town is burning down
And we'll dance on its ashes when it's gone

What can we say, this day and age
It all just blends into a blur and subtle haze
'Cause every day is weed and booze and cigarettes
While we're listening to tunes on old cassettes
And as the days turn into years you realize
That the best days of your life are before your eyes
'Cause every day is speed and blow and cigarettes
It's safe to say I love you so with no regrets
