Dear friend, amends
I'm writing on the walls til bittersweet words start to squall
And tear the sails from shipwrecked friends
I'm torn, I'm writing door to door and what is more
I can't afford the feeble fragments of a washed-up mend
While there is no feat, I was still reluctant to have had that greet
A noted failure, a notch in my belt
I'll stand up and try with someone else
I'll try with anyone

Cast your iron fists aside
There's no more room for the swollen egos to be guiding the tides
Collectively we're headed downward to the divide
So why not die with a friend at your side
Oh why not die with some pride
Show your teeth again
Your reputations got a nasty fucking contagion
Your presumption is an ill leaded folk tale friend
So why not stand without falter to fend
Oh why not seize the end

Nihilistic interests keep us closer to our hearts and never more apart
We'll start captivating inspirations where our stories will flourish
But our stories won't flourish
Because our bonds are broken and torn
We're all just riding blindly into this storm
No ones gonna save us
No ones gonna save us
When will you lend a hand
Our bonds are broken and torn
We're all just gonna die here all alone
No ones gonna save us
No ones gonna save us anymore
