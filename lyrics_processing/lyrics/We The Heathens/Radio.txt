I think I'm going insane living in this neighborhood
From all the old and estranged that never leave their homes
Pale faces never seen sunlight Churchgoers up before the 1st light
All your kids got class in the morning
Repetition's chained you tight
But I don't even care
All your silence brings despair

Radio I've come to take you away to a place with stereo
A place where we don't give a shit if the neighbors piss and moan
Call the cops, we got locks, they can't kick down our doors
They've come to take you away

I think I'm going insane living in this fucking town
From all the people I hate, Idiocracy surrounds
Working your 9-5 doesn't mean a god damn thing
Just because you don't enjoy life doesn't mean you shouldn't let me
But I don't even care
All your silence brings despair

Radio I've come to take you away to a place with stereo
A place where we don't give a shit if the neighbors piss and moan
Call the cops, we got locks, they can't kick down our doors
They've come to take you away
You might also like
For all the times you wanted silence
We turned it up just one more notch
You're fools to believe the law
Disturb the peace, disturb the cause
We're a dying breed
Don't feed the flames they need

Radio I've come to take you away to a place with stereo
A place where we don't give a shit if the neighbors piss and moan
Call the cops, we got locks, they can't kick down our doors
They've come to take you away
Radio I've come to take you away to a place with stereo
A place where we don't give a shit if the neighbors piss and moan
Call the cops, we got locks, they can't kick down our doors
