Tracy Morgan's the new Nipsy
Skinny jeans are the new fashion
But none of that shit fits me
Weed smoke is the new incense
Two bucks is the new ten cents
Three strikes is the new lynching
Buying is the new renting
These lines are new Molotov's
Right now there's a new holocaust
More troops is the new call it off
I'm trying pry this collar off
Hip-hop is the new rock now
Curfews are the new lockdown
Gunshots are the new cricket chirps
Let's flip this shit top down

Fucking is the new "Hey, how do y'do?"
And revolution is the new "Fuck you"
The new "Fuck You"
Fucking is the new "Hey, how do y'do?"
And revolution is the new "Fuck you"
