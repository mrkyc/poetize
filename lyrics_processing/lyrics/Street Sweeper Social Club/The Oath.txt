The lamppost could swear it had seen me before
And stared as I stumbled through the motel door
The dirty mirror also thought I looked familiar
But commented only that my suit was brilliant
The TV bolted to the wall and cracked
Remembered how I cried and said I'd never come back
In the lacquer of the table, I had carved my oath
With a burnt butter knife and this is what I wrote

I pledge to get their foot off my neck
Instead I shall demand my respect
I'll fight even if I won't win
Alright, the beginning is the end
I pledge to make the bosses cringe
Instead we'll get some justified ends
I'll fight till the system is gone
Recite this ex-losers song

(Yeeee!) Alright, muthafuckas!
(Coo-Coooo!) Fight, muthafuckas!
(Yeeee!) Alright, muthafuckas!
(Coo-Coooo!) Fight, muthafuckas!
You might also like
I pledge to live life as lesson
That said even my words are weapons
I'll fight show love in motion
Alright, mountains move from oceans
I pledge there is no surrender
Instead I'll expose their agenda
Fight and make vampires bleed
Recite this ex-losers creed

(Yeeee!) Alright, muthafuckas!
(Coo-Coooo!) Fight, muthafuckas!
(Yeeee!) Alright, muthafuckas!
(Coo-Coooo!) Fight, muthafuckas!

I pledge that I'll taste each second
That said, I know each moment's a present
I'll fight a battle fit for ballads
Alright, at two we hit the palace
I pledge that we are individuals
That said, from you I'm indivisible
Fight and match the blaze of comets
Recite this ex-losers promise
The carpet inquired if I'd lay there again
And where was the girl from when there last I had been
The commode refused to speak as I made my escape
It knew every subtle nuance of my war torn face
The concrete outside felt disrespected
It was partly my fault it had been neglected
At the precipice of fate is where I carved my oath
With the dagger from my back and you know what I wrote
(Yeeee!) Alright, muthafuckas!
(Coo-Coooo!) Fight, muthafuckas!
(Yeeee!) Alright muthafuckas!
(Coo-Coooo!) Fight, muthafuckas!
