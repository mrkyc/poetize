I fly like paper, get high like planes
If you catch me at the border I got warrants in my name
If you come around, hey we workin' all day
Your life gon' pass you in a second if you wait

Just like Jesse James when I'm sittin' on trains
Every step we get you see we're clockin' that game
Dog food for dinner, the world is in flames
Bonafide hustlers makin' that change
Just like Jesse James when I'm sittin' on trains
Every step we get you see we're clockin' that game
Dog food for dinner, the world is in flames
Bonafide hustlers makin' that change, now
