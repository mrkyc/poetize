Gon' talk smack, flash my gat
I'm finna spit and hold my dick
And heat shit up like a thermostat
Grab your partner by the chaps
Give your partner a pimp-slap
To symbolize the ghetto trap
Step to the right, give three claps
Kids jam-packed in tenement shacks
Ain't shit cookin' on the stove but crack
This is the bat this hell begat
'Cause bosses are kleptomaniacs
Two by two, Promenade
Duck from a B1 bomber raid
Ain't 'bout the plans Osama made
Banks get paid off petrol trade
Circulate, Dosey-do
How much cash could a o-z grow?
'Til all are fed and all have beds
My skin is black; my star is red
FBI comin' round the outside
Which one of us finna die tonight?
Is we finna fight over crumbs to bite
Or make a whole muthafuckin' world ignite?
You might also likeEverybody throw them bows
Right upside your partner's nose
By now you've got bloody clothes
Crabs in the barrel, so the story goes
Think of all their savage acts
Grabbin' scratch from average cats
Bureaucrats with strings attached
Walk in place; light the match
Two by two, Promenade
Duck from a B1 bomber raid
Ain't 'bout the plans Osama made
Banks get paid off petrol trade
Circulate, Dosey-do
How much cash could a o-z grow?
'Til all are fed and all have beds
My skin is black; my star is red
Everybody, get down low
'Bout the level of your toes
These dance moves we usually do
Are not the ones that we have chose
Grab on to that beat and grind
Try your best to stay alive
We can run, we can't hide
Might as well just stay and fight
Two by two, Promenade
Duck from a B1 bomber raid
Ain't 'bout the plans Osama made
Banks get paid off petrol trade
Circulate, Dosey-do
How much cash could a o-z grow?
Till all are fed and all have beds
