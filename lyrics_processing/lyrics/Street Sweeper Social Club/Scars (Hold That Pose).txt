Had a car with stuck doors and primer finish
To take a girl out I had to climb her in it
She really hoped her friends didn't find her in it
When she wanted two drinks, I said "Mind your limit"
Show up at the party, new suit and Stacy's
Very next day, return it back to Macy's
Say "It smells like sweat sir, is you crazy?
Gimme my refund or push up daisies!"
Me and two friends used to share a pager
So every three days I would swear I'm major
'lectricity from the next door neighbor
Broke motherfuckers be sharp as lasers
I was mo' to' back than a stolen car tag
Just used somebody else's card for the bar tab
Dollar hot dog wasn't nothin' to bark at
It's only funny 'cause you don't see where the scars at

Got free cable 'cause I know somebody
Got some broke partners that'll throw somebody
Not pickin up the phone cause I owe somebody
Got a twamp note I'mma photocopy
A date with me was all kinda fun
Go to the restaurant, dine and run
The bank might keep declinin' 'em
But these hundred dollar checks, I'm signin' 'em
The rubber on my sneakers used to flap when walkin'
It looked like two little muppets talkin'
"Ay, whassup baby? Do you come here often?
Oh, I got some new shoes, they haven't been brought in
This old ripped jacket is cause I am an artist
I'll burn rubber on you if my car will get started"
Third month avoiding landlords is the hardest
It's only funny cause you don't see where the scar is

Welfare checks, food stamps
Collection notes, broken amps
Paycheck late, shut off notice
Pyramid schemes, hocus pocus
Welfare checks, food stamps
Collection notes, broken amps
Paycheck late, shut off notice
Pyramid schemes are hocus pocus
Hold that pose, hold that pose
Hold that pose and don't ever come down
Hold that pose, hold that pose
Hold that pose and don't ever come down
