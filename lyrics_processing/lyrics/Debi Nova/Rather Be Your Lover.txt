And let me kiss you
I know it sounds cold but don't want you on my shoulder
With your girlfriend issues
This look but don't touch, tell me isn't it a bit much
Next time you come closer I'm gonna blind fold you with permission
I don't wanna
I dont wanna be your friend
I rather be your lover
(Be your lover, your lover)
I don't wanna
I dont wanna be your friend
I rather be your lover
I rather be your lover
Sooner or later you'll fall into my plate
And and I'll eat you up
Ooh, it's human nature that makes me wanna chase you
And fill my cup, common hit me up
When will you discover that you're my future lover
And you're making me nuts, you know it
I don't wanna
I dont wanna be your friend
I rather be your lover
(Be your lover, your lover)
I don't wanna
I dont wanna be your friend
I rather be your lover
I rather be your lover
I don't wanna
I dont wanna be your friend
I rather be your lover
(Be your lover, your lover)
I don't wanna
I dont wanna be your friend
I rather be your lover
I rather be your lover
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I rather be your lover
Wouldn't it be better if you could just forget her
And let me kiss you
When will you discover that you're my future lover
Baby, my future lover
I don't wanna
I dont wanna be your friend
I rather be your lover
(Be your lover, your lover)
I don't wanna
I dont wanna be your friend
I rather be your lover
I rather be your lover
I don't wanna
I dont wanna be your friend
I rather be your lover
(Be your lover, your lover)
I don't wanna
I dont wanna be your friend
I rather be your lover
I rather be your lover
