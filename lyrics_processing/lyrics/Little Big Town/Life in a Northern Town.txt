A Salvation Army band played
And the children drank lemonade
And the morning lasted all day
All day
And through an open window came
Like Sinatra in a younger day
Pushing the town away
Away

Hey ah ma ma ma
Into the night
Hey ah ma ma ma, hey ah
Life in a northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma ma

They sat on the stony ground
And he took a cigarette out
And everyone else came down
To listen
It was a winter 1963
They felt that the world would freeze
With John F. Kennedy
And The Beatles

They shut the factory down
Hey ma ma ma ma

The evening had turned to rain
Watched the water roll down the drain
As they followed him down
To the station
He would never wave goodbye
You could see it written in his eyes
As the train pulled out of sight
Bye bye

Hey ah ma ma ma
Into the night
Hey ah ma ma ma, hey ah
Life in a northern town
Hey ma ma ma ma
Take it easy on yourselves
Hey ah ma ma ma
Into the night
Hey ah ma ma ma, hey ah
