I spread my legs wide open for you, baby
So be a man, pump it harder inside me
I'm naked here laying, waiting for you, baby, alone
Alone, alone, alone
I'm coming closer, getting wetter for you, baby
You got me feeling, you got me dreaming, wiling out
No need to worry, wanna feel your explosion inside
Inside, inside

Get me off
(Just get me off)
Get me off
(Just get me off)
Just get me off
(Just get me off)
Just get me off
(Just get me off)
Off, off, off!

Now let me ride you like the rodeo, baby
I'll twirl around a couple times until I make you (moan)
I'll do it to you all night until I make you cum
You cum, you cum, you cum
You need to run your fingers through my messy hair
You need to pull it back tight, baby, touch me there
If you want to hear me screaming out loud
(Hey, hey, hey!)
You might also like
Get me off
(Just get me off)
Get me off
(Just get me off)
Just get me off
(Just get me off)
Just get me off
(Just get me off)
Off, off, off!

Let me love you right now
Fall before my feet
Let me love you right now
Every single beat
Let me love you right now
Can't you feel the heat?
Let me love you right now

Get me off
(Just get me off)
Get me off
(Just get me off)
Just get me off
(Just get me off)
Just get me off
(Just get me off)
Off, off, off!
Nasty girl (nasty girl)
Nasty girl (nasty girl)
Nasty girl (nasty girl)
Nasty girl, I'm a nasty girl

Get me off
(Just get me off)
Get me off
(Just get me off)
Just get me off
(Just get me off)
Just get me off
(Just get me off)
