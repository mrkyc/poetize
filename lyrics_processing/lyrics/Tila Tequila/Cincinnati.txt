I like all the boys and all the girls that come to play
I-I like eating birthday cakes and party everyday
I-I-I-I like all the boys and all the girls that come to play
I-I-I like eating birthday cake's and party everyday

I'm chopping it up on the way to the bathroom
Ch-chopping it up on the way to the ba-ba-ba-bath
Chopping it up on the way to the bathroom
Ch-chopping it up on the way to the ba-ba-ba-bath

Come, baby, come (uh)

Some famous wanker walked up to me
He says do you like publicity
So I spit my tea up in his face
Get your bloody hands off my birthday cake
I don't know what you came here to do
I'm waiting in the Q tryina get to the U
So I can chop it up on the 1's and 2's
1's and 2's, 1's and 2's
