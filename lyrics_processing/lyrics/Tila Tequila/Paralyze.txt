(Na-na-na) Every time you messed with my head
(Na-na-na) All the things you did and you said
(Na-na-na) See my scars spell out your name and
You're paralyzing me
(Na-na-na) Every time you left me behind
(Na-na-na) All these tears are no longer mine
(Na-na-na) Because you took it all away and
You're paralyzing me

Memories, they fall apart
Whenever you're inside my head
Take my tears, they say a lot
Since you're the one who put them there

When I needed you the most
You were nowhere to be found
But I still hung on just hoping for
My love to come around

(Na-na-na) Every time you messed with my head
(Na-na-na) All the things you did and you said
(Na-na-na) See my scars spell out your name and
You're paralyzing me
(Na-na-na) Every time you left me behind
(Na-na-na) All these tears are no longer mine
(Na-na-na) Because you took it all away and
You're paralyzing me
You might also like
I miss those times when things
Were simple and your heart was mine
I just don't understand how
You could throw it all away

When I needed you the most
You were nowhere to be found
But I still hung on just hoping for
My love to come around

(Na-na-na) Every time you messed with my head
(Na-na-na) All the things you did and you said
(Na-na-na) See my scars spell out your name and
You're paralyzing me
(Na-na-na) Every time you left me behind
(Na-na-na) All these tears are no longer mine
(Na-na-na) Because you took it all away and
You're paralyzing me

Look up at the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Nah, it's just me again crying in the rain
I can't figure out why I feel so ashamed
You pushed me so hard that I feel so insane
Every time I'd cry you ain't wipe my eyes
Whenever I was scared you weren't by my side
The only thing it did was it made me wise
So I guess it's all good 'cause it kept me alive
When I needed you the most
You were nowhere to be found
But I still hung on just hoping for
My love to come around

(Na-na-na) Every time you messed with my head
(Na-na-na) All the things you did and you said
(Na-na-na) See my scars spell out your name and
You're paralyzing me
(Na-na-na) Every time you left me behind
(Na-na-na) All these tears are no longer mine
(Na-na-na) Because you took it all away and
