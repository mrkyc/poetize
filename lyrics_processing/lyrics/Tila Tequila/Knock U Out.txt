Girls be acting like they retards
Mad cause they man straight up rock hard;
And he ain't even on my radar
Tila Tequila, rockstar. Doing it and gettin head in my car
The baddest bitch from Queens to Crenshaw;
When you stuffin your bra
Don't need a crew everytime I smash out
Look me up and down and I'll pull your tracks out
Talk some shit; I'll lay ya ass out
I'm from H-Town, bitch, you know what we about
I put down for my city And I get-get-gridy
Yeah muthafucker That's what's up
And just because your girl pretty
With some big ass titties
Don't mean I won't fuck you up
I bet you won't be lookin' so HOT
When I knock you out and make you say WHAT? !
(Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh my God!)
Some of these bitches be industry
I'm exact opposite bitch, In the streets
I'm in my twenties, you 43
Now she's trying to be just like me
I don't wanna fuck your man, hell nah, I
Just wanna hit the club with the fam & get low
I make your nose bleed like too much blow
Then I jump on stage and make 'em say OHHHH
Now I'm gonna do what it do, but some of these dudes is bitches too
Suckas buying cars sprung on the coo-chie, yeah that's me. Tila Tequila
