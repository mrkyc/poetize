Locked up all by myself in this
Small room, feel the ignition twists
Lights out, over and down with it
Everybody leaving me tired and hopeless
Loud noises ringing into my head
Feels like I'm hanging with the dead
Cold air blowing into my face
So I tried to light up the fireplace

Do you know what that feels like?
Everyone is out to get me
Do you know what that feels like?
Everyone is out to get me
Do you know what that feels like?
Everyone is out to get me
Do you know what that feels like?
Everyone is out to get me

Jane says she wants to come out and play
Destroy everything that I made
Maybe I should just let her win
Tired of fighting tired from deep within
Eyes shut, she just won't go away
Get help that's what my friends would say
But I can't, I will just let her be
Because Jane is actually only me

Do you know what that feels like?
Everyone is out to get me
Do you know what that feels like?
Everyone is out to get me
Do you know what that feels like?
Everyone is out to get me
Do you know what that feels like?
Everyone is out to get me
