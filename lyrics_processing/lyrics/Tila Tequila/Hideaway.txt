No matter what you do
They won't be happy til we say that we're through
So I won't let them know
No I won't let you go
I'll never let them get between me and you
(No no no no) Never let them in the way
(No no no no) Baby we can get away
Cause I want you
You want me
Let's do it
I don't wanna tell anybody
They wanna know that I'll never give in
Baby let's forget everybody
I don't wanna let anybody else in
Come and meet me at this hideaway (hideaway)
Hideaway (hideaway)
Hideaway (hideaway)
Come and meet me at this
Hideaway (hideaway)
Hideaway (hideaway)
Hideaway (hideaway)

Although it's hard sometimes
I'll go and make some crys
But the thought of losing you, baby I'd die
(No no no no) Never let them in the way
(No no no no) Baby we can get away
Cause I want you
You want me

I've been around the world
Settin here and then far
If I can't be your girl then forget it they can have it back
Cause it don't mean a thing
If you're not here with me
Makin love to you is everything I've ever dreamed
Whether it's in LA or in Wha
December or July
You can count on me
Until the day I die
I wrote this song for you
Baby you're my boo
It's True
Cause-
I don't wanna tell anybody
They wanna know that I'll never give in
Baby let's forget everybody
I don't wanna let anybody else in
Come and meet me at this hideaway (hideaway)
Hideaway (hideaway)

Come and meet me at this
