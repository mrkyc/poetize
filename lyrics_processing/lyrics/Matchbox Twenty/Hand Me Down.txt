Someday they'll find your small town world on a big town avenue
Gonna make you like the way they talk, when they're talkin' to you
Gonna make you break out of your shell, 'cause they tell you to
Gonna make you like the way they lie, better than the truth

They'll tell you everything you wanted someone else to say
They're gonna break your heart, yeah

From what I've seen
You're just one more hand me down
'Cause no one's tried to give you what you need
So lay all your troubles down
I am with you now

Somebody oughta take you in, try to make you love again
Try to make you like the way they feel when they're under your skin
Never once do you think that they would lie when they're holdin' you
Then you wonder why they haven't called when they said they'd call you

You'll start to wonder if you're ever gonna make it by
You'll start to think you were born blind

The straight to your heart times
When livin' ain't easy
You can stand up against me
And maybe rely on me
And cry on me, yeah

Oh no, no, no

Someday they'll open up your world
Shake you down to the drawing board
They'll do their best to change you
They still can't erase you

From what I've seen
You're just one more hand me down
'Cause no one's tried to give you what you need
So lay all your troubles down
I am with you now
Lay them down on me, oh, yeah
You're just one more hand me down
And all those nights don't give you what you need
So lay all your troubles down
On me
