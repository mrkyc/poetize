I don't know why sometimes we seem so apart
Sewn together with a broken heart
I try to see you, but it's getting dark
Words keep flowing out, I wonder what they mean
You're like a little piece of kerosene
But, girl, you've always been a friend to me

And I've been too proud sometimes
Chasing fault lines

Oh no, I'm gonna be there always
After the pain has gone away
The feelings are so strong
This can be our song, this can be our song
Oh no, I'll never make you cry again
I'm gonna set things right again
And I won't let 'em go wrong
This can be our song, this can be our song

I don't know if someone else could handle me
Well, I don't know what I'm supposed to be
You're the only one who really sees, you get me
I feel something growing deep inside of me
What I say and what I mean
Always seem to disagree

Oh no, I'm gonna be there always
After the pain has gone away
The feelings are so strong

Oh no, I'll never make you cry again
