Well, it's nothin', it's so normal
You just stand there, I could say so much
But I don't go there 'cause I don't want to
Well, I was thinkin' if you were lonely
Maybe we could leave here and no one would know
At least not to the point that we would think so

And everyone here
Knows everyone here is thinkin' 'bout somebody else
Well, it's best if we all keep this under our heads
Well, I couldn't tell
If anyone here was feelin' the way I do
But I'm lonely now
And I don't know how
To get it back to good

No-oh-oh
No-oh-oh, no

This don't mean that you own me
Well, this ain't no good, in fact, it's phony as hell
Yeah, but things worked out just like you wanted to
If you see me out, you don't know me
Try to turn your head, try and give me some room
I'll figure out just what I'm gonna do

'Cause everyone here
Hates everyone here for doin' just like they do
And it's best if we all keep this quiet instead
And I couldn't tell
Why everyone here was doin' me like they do
But I'm sorry now
And I don't know how
To get it back to good

Well, everyone here
Is wonderin' what it's like to be with somebody else
And everyone here's to blame
And everyone here
Gets caught up in the pleasure of the pain
Yeah, well, everyone here hides shades of shame
Yeah, but lookin' inside, we're the same, we're the same
And we're all grown now
Yeah, but we don't know how
To get it back to good

Knows everyone here is thinkin' 'bout somebody else
And it's best if we all keep this under our heads
Yeah, our heads, yeah, yeah
See, I couldn't tell, no
If anyone here was feelin' the way I do
But it's over now
Yeah, I don't know how
Guess it's over now
And there's no gettin' back to good
