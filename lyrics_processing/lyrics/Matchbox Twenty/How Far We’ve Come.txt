(Hello, hello, hello)

I'm wakin' up at the start of the end of the world
But it's feelin' just like every other mornin' before
Now I wonder what my life is gonna mean if it's gone
The cars are movin' like a half a mile an hour and I
Started starin' at the passengers wavin' goodbye
Can you tell me what was ever really special about me all this time?

But I believe the world is burnin' to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Well, I believe it all is comin' to an end
Oh well, I guess we're gonna pretend
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come

I think it turned ten o'clock, but I don't really know
Then I can't remember carin' for an hour or so
Started cryin' and I couldn't stop myself
I started runnin', but there's no where to run to
I sat down on the street, took a look at myself
Said, "Where you goin', man? You know the world is headed for hell
Say your goodbyes if you've got someone you can say goodbye to"

It's gone, gone, baby, it's all gone
There's no one on the corner and there's no one at home
Well, it was cool, cool, it was just all cool
Now it's over for me and it's over for you
Well, it's gone, gone, baby, it's all gone
There's no one on the corner and there's no one at home
Well, it was cool, cool, it was just all cool
Now it's over for me and it's over for you
