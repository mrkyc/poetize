She said, "I don't know if I've ever been good enough
I'm a little bit rusty
And I think my head is cavin' in
And I don't know if I've ever been really loved
By a hand that's touched me
And I feel like something's gonna give
And I'm a little bit angry"

Well, this ain't over

Well, I will, well, I will
I wanna take you for granted

Like I'm a little untrustin'

When my face don't seem to wanna shine
'Cause it's a little bit dirty"

Well, well, don't just stand there
Say nice things to me
'Cause I've been cheated, I've been wronged
And you, you don't know me
