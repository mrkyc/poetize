Been a while since you've been around
But you're back in town
And I know I shouldn't call you now
But I just miss the sound of you saying that you miss me, too
You know what I do
Find excuses just to see you
I know

A different side, kind of a brighter green
You couldn't find in me

Like I used to do, like I'd love to, promise me that

If you change your mind
You know where to find me
Patient for the right time
Waiting on a green light
If you see the signs
And you wanna hit rewind
See how much we shine
I know you swore you'd never
Oh, but if you change your mind
If you change your mind
