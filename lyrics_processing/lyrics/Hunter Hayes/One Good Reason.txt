It's been one of those days that I should get used to
Wake up, get goin', stay busy
Puttin' off gettin' home 'cause I miss you
Is it freedom when the space that you want turns into a prison?
Is it leaving if I can't move on and I'm stuck here looking for

One good reason not to love you
One good reason wouldn't be even enough to
Unpaint all of those pictures
There's no way to unremember
I'd love to just unlove you
I've tried to, but I can't find
One good reason
One good reason

All your little bad habits should've drove me crazy
And I fell for every little thing and tryin' to forget ain't easy
I keep lyin' 'cause I wanna feel strong, but I just feel stupid
And I'm dyin', oh, 'cause even if I found it, what would I do with

One good reason not to love you?
One good reason wouldn't be even enough to
Unpaint all of those pictures
There's no way to unremember
I'd love to just unlove you
I've tried to but I can't find
One good reason (One good reason)
One good reason (One good reason)
One good reason
One good reason

Yeah, it's true, and I know it ain't good for me
But I can't let go, give up and rewind
If I could, I'd still be askin' why I can't find

One good reason, baby, not to love you
You can't find me one good reason wouldn't be even enough to
Unpaint all of those pictures
There's no way to unremember
I'd love to just unlove you
I've tried to but I can't find
One good reason
One good reason, yeah
One good reason
