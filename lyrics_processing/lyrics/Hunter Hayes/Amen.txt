Oh, I was a wreck
I hit my knees till they were bruised
I've given up
It felt like all that I could do
I walked the line
Until the line was just a blur
And love was out of reach, and faith was just a word

Oh, I've been searching, I've been praying
I've been hurt, and I've been patient
I've been lost and found again
Waiting for my Amen!
Looking at you now I believe
Someone up there's looking out for me
And I know how my prayer ends
Baby, you're my Amen!

Hallelujah, you're my Amen!
Hallelujah, oh, you're my Amen!

Oh, I grew up going to church in a two-street town
I read the verse
But it never made sense until right now
Your kiss is like the healing wind
Holy water on my skin
The way you saved me, baby, makes me feel like
I've been touched by heaven
