I'm not a criminal (Oh no, oh no)
But I felt like a prisoner (For so long so long)
And all I ever wanted (Was to love and to be loved, yeah)
So what did I do to you? (So wrong, so wrong)
Oh 'cause you broke so much more than just a promise
When you made me believe I wasn't wanted
I could miss you like you want but if I'm honest

I feel like the one that got away
Don't know how I escaped
Breathing better 'cause I'm better now
In the middle of the night
Made it to the other side
You can run but you can't catch me now
I'm the one that got away
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm the one that got away
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Turns out you're not a god (All the faith that I gave to you)
The silence is all I got (And I hate that I prayed to you)
All the chains that I couldn't break
The games that I couldn't play
'Cause you'd always win them anyway
Never thought there would come a day
Where I'd be saved and safe enough to say that

Is it worth the price I paid for staying?
I gave it all, you gave it all away and now
I'm takin' back the piece of me you wasted 'cause

I'm the one that got away
Don't know how I escaped
Breathing better 'cause I'm better now

Made it to the other side
