She rolled in from the west in a summer sun dress
Hotter than the heat in July
With her wind-blown hair; it just wasn't fair
The way she was blowin' my mind
Have you ever noticed every hurricane
Gets its name from a girl like this?
She's a cat five kind, keeps you up at night
Hangin' on to the edge of a kiss

She's a beautiful mess
Yeah, the kind you love to love
But what happens next?
I got a feelin' when the sun comes up

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning

Ain't it funny how it feels when you're burning your wheels
Somewhere between going and gone?
You get so lost that you can't turn it off
You give in and you just turn it on
She's a heart full of rain, red lips like a flame
She's a girl from your favorite song

What a beautiful mess
One part angel, one part perfect, one part a wreck
The kind of flood you'll never forget

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
Yeah, I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign, gonna wish I had a sign
Of a storm warning yeah

A little heads up, little more time
Little leeway some kind of sign (Some kind of sign)
Oh, would've been nice
Some kind of radar system
If I heard it, yeah, I would've listened
