I'm coming to see you with skylines and rearview
For streets that I used to know
I'm finding my way back home

I remember the last night your eyes and that goodbye
You whispering, "Please don't go," oh
I'm finding my way back home

We burn strong and bright
Some fires never die
And I learned my lesson one heartbreak too late this time

And we were living, learning, laying in a bed that was burning
It's so hard when you're young and in love
We were trying and fighting, holding on, laughing and crying
'Cause that's what you do when you're young and in love

The miles make me miss you
But it's worth what I've been through
To learn what I need to know, and oh
My heart knows the way back home

Well, I miss you far and wide
Love ain't black and white
I'm learning from hurting that you're what I've searched to find

Oh, and we were just living and learning, laying in a bed that was burning
It's so hard when you're young and in love
We were trying and fighting, holding on, laughing and crying
Whoa, well, that's what you do when you're young and in love

Oh, young and in love, now I can see
The mess that I made, what you mean to me
Well, would I make it up, get down on my knees
And I'll do anything to get back what we used to be
Young and in love
Young and in love, oh
'Cause it's so hard to be young and in love

Trying and fighting, holding on, laughing and crying
Whoa, well, that's what you do when you're young and in love
Oh, young and in love
Young and in love
Young and in love
