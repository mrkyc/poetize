It's not a prison, it's not a demon, it's not a sin
No, it's a state of mind I find myself in
It's not a dream, no, it's as real as it gets
And no, I'm not lost, I just lose myself, I guess

When the sky gets too dark
When the water gets too deep
When I feed the fire so much that I can't even take the heat
If I ever run too far
And when the pieces come unglued
The mess of me will always need the best of you
Rescue

Through all the highs and lows
The can't undo's I regret the most
The wall so hard feels like I can't get through
Rescue
Every morning by your side
Just one look at you sometimes
You don't even know you're coming to
The rescue

Send a flare up in the eye of the storm
I send a prayer up and a bottle to the shore
But there are no words for what I'm searching for
What I mean is, that I'm needing you more
