You open your heart, open your mind, let somebody in
Take a walk through your past
The good and the bad, decide you can do this again
But it's supposed to feel different
Supposed to feel safe, safe like going home
But just like sand, it slips through your hands
Before you know, it your faith is gone

Every late night call, every morning kiss
All the "I can't live without you's"
And you say goodbye like this
Don't you understand? Do you even care?
If you love me like you said you did
Well, you'd still be standing here
You think you know somebody

It's all just a blur, the nights are the worst
This bed still smells like you
Wake up from the dreams, catch my breath
It takes everything I've got to move
Yeah, it could've been a long walk talk to fix this
The seas were getting rough, but I thought we were worth it
Worth the try, worth the fight
Show you what I know, yeah

You think you know somebody

Tell me, where did you go when the lights came up?
I don't even know you anymore
But holding a knife, I can see things better
Yeah, you've done this before

You think you know
Yeah, you think you know somebody
You think you know, you think you know, you think you know, you think you know
You think you know

Every late night call, every morning kiss
