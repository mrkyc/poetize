One, two, three, four
Mmm
Yeah

Na, na, na-na-na-na

Na, na-na-na-na

Oh, I used to sing it
And I used to crank it with the windows down
I used to love it
Oh, but I'm over it, man, I'm over it now

I used to leave it playing on repeat
I spun that record 'til it turned on me
Yeah, the DJ knows exactly what I need
I need an "out with the old, in with a new" beat

You were the rooftop, at the top of my lungs
Blowing the speakers, in the back of my trunk
And you had your chance then, yeah, but I'm moving on
And now you're just yesterday's song, you're yesterday's song
The soundtrack, every night in my bed
You were the "woo-hoo", getting stuck in my head
Now you're just an echo, when the feeling is gone
Baby, now you're just yesterday's song, you're yesterday's song

We had a moment
There's no more magic in the melody
It's lost and you know it
It's just the sound of what we used to be

Yeah, I used to leave it playing on repeat
I spun that record 'til it turned on me
Yeah, the DJ knows exactly what I need
A little dancing could be good for me

You were the rooftop, at the top of my lungs
Blowing the speakers, in the back of my trunk
And you had your chance then, yeah, but I'm moving on
And now you're just yesterday's song, you're yesterday's song
The soundtrack, every night in my bed
You were the "woo-hoo", getting stuck in my head
Now you're just an echo, when the feeling is gone
Baby, now you're just yesterday's song, you're yesterday's song

Na, na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na nah
Na, na-na-na-na
(Oh, you're yesterday's song)
Na, na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na nah
Na, na-na-na-na
I got a whole new "hey"! (hey!)
I got a brand new "woo"! (woo!)
I got new moves, and you're old news
Got a new song, I wanna sing to you
I'm gonna get by, I'm gonna get through without you

You used to be the rooftop, at the top of my lungs
Blowing the speakers, in the back of my trunk
Yeah, you had your chance then, yeah, but I'm moving on (yeah, I'm moving on)
And now you're just yesterday's song, you're yesterday's song
The soundtrack, every night in my bed
You were the "woo-hoo", getting stuck in my head (stuck in my head)
Now you're just an echo, when the feeling is gone
Baby, now you're just yesterday's song, yesterday's song
Yesterday's song, oh

Na, na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na nah
Na, na-na-na-na
