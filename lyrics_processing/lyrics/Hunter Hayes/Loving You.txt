I can't sleep, it's like I'm trying to breathe underwater
Recovery is taking me so much longer
It's like the drunkest form of sober
Door slam kind of closure
It's the never getting over that's dragging me under, oh man
I could be mad and I could want you to be lonely too
I could throw away your things but I can't get away from you

I love the songs we sang, I love the times we had
I love all the memories you made with me that I can't get back
I love that you're moving on, that you love somebody new
I'm alright with holding on, not letting go, I swear it's true
I just hate loving you
Yeah, I just hate loving you

Enjoy your life, your happiness, and your freedom
You don't owe me no apologies, I don't need 'em
All this pain is my purpose, yeah, it's weakness but it's worth it
And it hurts but it's what's left of you leavin'
I don't need you comin' back and fixin' anything
All I'll ever ask of you is to remember me

I love the songs we sang, I love the times we had
I love all the memories you made with me that I can't get back
I love that you're moving on, that you love somebody new
I'm alright with holding on, not letting go, I swear it's true
I just hate loving you
I just hate loving you
