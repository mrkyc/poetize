Standing at the edge of the unknown where the wild blue sky begins
This is where I take all my Sundays I've saved and I cash 'em in
I close my eyes, cut the cord, drop the chain and I shed my skin
Funny how you don't know you can fly 'til you finally catch the wind
Nothing changes your perspective like the taste of leaving on her lips
I thought I was strong, thought I was made of stones, suddenly the lonely hit
You think you know the part you're playing 'til somebody goes and rewrites the script
It felt like falling, but it's funny, 'cause I never touched the ground again

Welcome to the wild blue
Where gravity can't find you
No storm that you can't fly through
Place that you can't fly to
Up here in the wild
Wild blue

I was scared of losing you 'cause losing you meant losing everything I know
But I found some sunlight in the space between the losing and the letting go
I've heard of demons but I never knew I had so many of my own
But the more I learned about the love I have to give, the more they leave me alone

Welcome to the wild blue
Where gravity can't find you
No storm that you can't fly through
Place that you can't fly to
Up here in the wild
Wild blue

Taking in the view, look at all the brand new, I can see the world from here
Healing and feeling like I'm breathing deeper in this atmosphere, yeah
I was scared of the heights, I went from fearing the feeling to feeling the fear
And once you get above the clouds, it's funny how that feeling disappears

Oh, welcome to the wild blue
Where gravity can't find you
No storm that you can't fly through
Place that you can't fly to
Up here in the wild
Wild blue
