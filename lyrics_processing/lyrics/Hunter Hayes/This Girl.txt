I love this girl watching that throwback movie with a glass of wine
My real deal girl with her hair up, guard down, telling me what's on her mind
Call me crazy, but I don't think I'm ever gonna have a hard time learning how to love this girl
She's meeting all my friends
Yeah, I even told my mom about her
I'm falling more and more every minute, and I don't think I can live without her
I go on and on about how I could go
On and on about how much I love this girl, yeah

How lucky am I that I get to love this girl? (Love this girl)
I get to see that side of her that no one knows but me
She's a "one of a kind"
It's a one in a million chance that I would find her hand in mine
It's crazy I'm the lucky guy, the guy that gets to love this girl
Oh, the guy that gets to love this girl

My paradise is that bed-head beauty with the sleepy eyes
My best night is anyone that ends with her
Yeah, I swear that I'd trade everything I chase
They could take it all away
Long as I get to love this girl

How lucky am I that I get to love this girl? (Love this girl)
I get to see that side of her that no one knows but me
She's a "one of a kind"
It's a one in a million chance that I would find her hand in mine
It's crazy I'm the lucky guy, the guy that gets to love this girl
Oh, the guy that gets to love this girl
