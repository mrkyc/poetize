You're singing in the shower, like there's no one else around
Sliding down the hallway, dancing around the house
One glass of champagne and girl, you're painting up the town
That's when I love you more
When you're late for your friends party 'cause you can't find a thing to wear
You start cussing at humidity, and fussing with your hair
You give up and throw a T-shirt on like you don't even care
That's when I love you more

With every minute, every up and down together
As long as you're in it, girl, my world keeps getting better
I swear I can't fall harder, oh, but I've said that before
And just like that I love you more
Baby just like that, I love you more

When you can't see the sun, 'cause it's raining in your eyes
There's clouds around your halo, and your wings won't let you fly
When the whole world gets too heavy
Well, baby, that's when I'm gonna love you more
Yeah, love you more

With every minute, every up and down together
As long as you're in it, girl, my world keeps getting better
I swear I can't fall harder, oh, but I've said that before
And just like that I love you more
Baby just like that, I love you more, yeah
Love you more
Oh

With every minute, every up and down together
As long as you're in it, girl, my world keeps getting better
I swear I can't fall harder, oh, but I've said that before
And just like that I love you more
Baby just like that, I love you more
(I love you more, I love you more)
