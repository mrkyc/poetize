Said a lot of stuff that I don't remember
Lord knows I'm guilty
Of a lot of sins that I don't wanna live with
Mama'd probably cut me off the family tree
If she heard half the stories people tellin' me

Oh s***, there's proof
Insta's out there telling all my truth
I can't lie, so I own it
Been a rough week, so what? I deserve it
Sorry to the Uber guy that took me home
It's kinda sad but I'm kinda glad I'm wakin' up alone

I started with one shot
To have a good time
Everybody knows how easy one can turn into five
But don't judge me 'cause it ain't nobody's life but mine
And I only get one shot
So I take it one shot at a time

Yeah
Take it one shot at a time
Hey
One shot at a time

Mess up, live and learn
Repent and repeat, build the bridge then burn it
No shame, just secrets
Got a lot of memories, not a lot of regrets
Every time I said I'd never do it again
Was right before I headed out for one more spin

I started with one shot
To have a good time
Everybody knows how easy one can turn into five
But don't judge me 'cause it ain't nobody's life but mine
And I only get one shot
So I take it one shot at a time

Yeah
Take it one shot at a time
Hey
One shot at a time

I think my fear of missing out
Makes me do the one thing I could do without
It starts with one shot
To have a good time
Everybody knows how easy one can turn into five
But don't judge me 'cause it ain't nobody's life but mine
And I only get one shot
So I take it one shot at a time

Yeah
Take it one shot at a time
One shot at a time
One shot at a time
