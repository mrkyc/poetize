Two different people
'Round and 'round again
We keep pretending around our friends
We're two different people
And you're mixing signals
Mixing you and me and the truth between
Just like we're mixing drinks, you're mixing signals

All the talking is just talking
'Til the talking stops and everybody leaves
They think you're going home
But they don't know that you been coming home with me, yeah

Baby, when the sun goes down
We make secrets we don't talk about
Girl, you make the stars come out
And the difference is like night and day, night and day
I melt into you like a sunset red
And you burn me up with every breath
Baby, when you're falling into me, falling into you
Nothing in-between
We get tangled up like night and day, night and day, yeah

Ooh, stop

When you wake up tomorrow
Will you change your mind and draw the line
Or will you still be mine when you wake up tomorrow?
Your body language
Oh, it contradicts and goes against
Every single little thing you've been saying

All the talking is just talking
'Til the talking stops and you lean into me, into me
And when midnight hits your lips
Without a word, your lips can tell me everything I need

Baby, when the sun goes down
We make secrets we don't talk about
Girl, you make the stars come out
And the difference is like night and day, night and day
I melt into you like a sunset red
And you burn me up with every breath
Baby, when you're falling into me, falling into you
Nothing in-between
We get tangled up like night and day, night and day, yeah
Talking is just talking 'til the talking stops

Oh, when the sun goes down
We make secrets we don't talk about
Girl, you make the stars come out
And the difference is like night and day, night and day
I melt into you like a sunset red
And you burn me up with every breath
Baby, when you're falling into me, falling into you
Nothing in-between
We get tangled up like night and day, oh, like night and day

Baby, when the sun goes down
We make secrets we don't talk about
Girl, you make the stars come out
