I've never seen Venice
Or slow danced under Paris lights
Never stood by the pyramids
Or hiked up the great divide
I've never been to Times Square
To celebrate the New Year
And I've never seen Willie Nelson live
And if I never get to
That's alright

'Cause I've seen you with your hair down in your bare feet
Dancin' 'round the living room spillin' wine on your dress
And I've seen you on a bench seat
In a tank top and your blue jeans
Gettin' your lipstick on my neck
So if all I do is live in this small town with you
And never leave
I've seen all I need to see

I've never seen Ireland
And those green hills that roll for miles
But my guess is that they ain't got nothin' on your green eyes
And I've never seen Niagara falls or stood inside the prison walls
Where Cash recorded live
Some may say I'm missin' out
But that's a lie
You might also like
'Cause I've seen you when your song's on
And you're singin' words that are all wrong
And you swear to me that that's how it goes
And I've seen you when tears fall
'Cause the episode that you just saw
Felt like more than just a show
So if all I do is live in this small town with you
And never leave
I've seen all I need to see

Yeah, I've seen you with your hair down in your bare feet
Dancin' 'round the living room spillin' wine on your dress
And I've seen you on a bench seat
In a tank top and your blue jeans
Gettin' your lipstick on my neck
So if all I do is live in this small town with you
And never leave
Yeah, that'd be fine with me
