My mom was always running
Chasing after something
I heard you couldn't tell her nothing
When she was nineteen
She met my daddy
And took off in his T-top Chevy
But it went from hard to Heaven
When they found out about me

Every other weekend
Is all I got to see him
Sometimes he'd come get me
And we'd hit Tellico Creek
We'd take that boat and drive it
Grab the rods and reels and hop in
He'd open up that tackle box
And he'd open up to me
And he'd say

Son I hope you know how much I love you
And when you're not with me I'm always thinking of you
You're the drive inside my heart
The reason I reach for the stars above
He said, my world revolves around you
That's why I call you son

We'd drive back to a small apartment, it's
Hot Wheels on the worn out carpet
We'd play games 'til the Braves game started
And he let me stay up late
Time with him was always flying
Sundays never had good timing
I start to pack and end up crying
When he'd kneel down and say

Son I hope you know how much I love you
And when you're not with me I'm always thinking of you
You're the drive inside my heart
The reason I reach for the stars above
He said, my world revolves around you
That's why I call you son

I was gonna go live with him
But I guess God had other plans
'Cause on a two lane road on a Tuesday night
A drunk driver crossed that center line
They said my dad didn't feel a thing
I wish I could say the same
'Cause losing him, it left me cold
I was mad at God, couldn't let it go
And then one blue sky morning
A brown eyed baby boy was born and
I looked outside, it started pouring
I swear they were daddy's tears
My old man, I could almost see him
In that little face with a new heart beating
A pain in mine started leaving
When I whispered in his ears

Son I hope you know how much I love you
Now it all makes sense, this place in life I've come to
You fill the hole inside my heart
You're why I reach for the stars above
My world revolves around you
That's why I call you son
