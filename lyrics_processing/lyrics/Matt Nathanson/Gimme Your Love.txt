I've been waiting for the darkness
I've been aiming for the stars
I've been ending up in darkness
I've been swimming in shallow water
Trying to forget it all
I've been staring at walls for hours
Trying to be better off
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
It used to, it used to, it used to, it used to be mine
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
It used to, it used to, it used to, it used to be mine
Just gimme that lovin', honey
Gimme that love so sweet
Gimme that love and god I fall at your feet
Just gimme that lovin', honey
Gimme that love so sweet
Gimme that love and god I fall at your feet
I remember getting high
In your brother's old apartment
I remember thinking life
Was finally getting started

Trying not to fall apart
I've been holding my phone for hours
But been too proud to call
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
It used to, it used to, it used to, it used to be mine
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
It used to, it used to, it used to, it used to be mine
Just gimme that lovin', honey
Gimme that love so sweet
Gimme that love and god I fall at your feet
Just gimme that lovin', honey
Gimme that love so sweet
Gimme that love and god I fall at your feet
I'm alone and wasted darlin'
I've never been the same
I'll turn and face it darlin'
I'll take all the blame
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
It used to, it used to, it used to, it used to be mine
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
It used to, it used to, it used to, it used to be mine
Just gimme that lovin', honey
Gimme that love so sweet
Gimme that love and god I fall at your feet
Just gimme that lovin', honey
Gimme that love so sweet
