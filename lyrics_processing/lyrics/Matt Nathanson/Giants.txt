I don't wanna see the wires in the circus anymore
I wanna dream and make believe people can fly
I don't need to be reminded what it takes to kill the fun
I've got a head full of sharp knives

Yeah, it's easy to get colder
And it's easy to forget
So meet me where the light's dim
We can wake up every mornin'
We can set ourselves on fire
And we can do it all again

The world don't speak for us
They lack the confidence
Yeah, we're only hearts and bones and blood
Oh, but we are giants
Giants
The walls are closing in
We climb and they descend
With nothing but the clouds against our skin
Oh, we are giants
Giants

I wanna roll around the darkness
'Til the darkness goes away
'Til the television finally tells the truth
You know everybody's scared of things they don't understand
And all the living they don't do

Yeah, it's easy to get colder
And it's easy to forget
So meet me where the lights dim
We can wake up every mornin'
We can set ourselves on fire
And we can do it all again

The world don't speak for us
They lack the confidence
Yeah, we're only hearts and bones and blood
Oh, but we are giants
Giants
The walls are closing in
We climb and they descend
With nothing but the clouds against our skin
Oh, we are giants
Giants
I'm done tryin' to fit in
And be half forgiven for things that I never did
We're more than what scares us
We're final and fearless
We'll dance where the ice gets thin
Gets thin

The world don't speak for us
They lack the confidence
Yeah, we're only hearts and bones and blood
Oh, but we are giants
Giants
The walls are closing in
We climb and they descend
With nothing but the clouds against our skin
Oh, we are giants
