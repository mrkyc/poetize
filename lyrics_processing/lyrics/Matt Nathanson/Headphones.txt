Oh, oh
Oh, oh (headphones on on)

Cinderella's gone to New York City
Wants to shave her hair and disappear
18 years of never feeling pretty
Says she's finally thinking clear

Ain't too proud to swim or drown now baby (ain't too proud)
Ain't too proud to sink or see it through

She said
Everybody wants to be with me
I got all I need (all I need)
I feel invincible with my headphones on
Everybody posed for magazines (oh)
It's all just noise to me (noise to me)
I feel invincible with my headphones on
Oh (my headphones, headphones)
Oh (my headphones on)

If anybody comes around to find me (ooh, ooh)
If anybody asks for me she said (oh, oh)
Tell 'em all I'm in the deep end singing (ooh, ooh)
With this music in my head

Everybody posed for magazines (ooh)
It's all just noise to me (noise to me)
I feel invincible with my headphones on

With my headphones on
I feel invincible

People talking in their sleep
Can't see the forest for the trees
It's all scratch ticket lottery
(Oh, oh) oh oh oh
Brave new world, same old crowd
Good things whisper, bad things shout
I don't hear 'em now (oh)
She said
Everybody wants to be with me (be with me)

Everybody posed for magazines (oh)
