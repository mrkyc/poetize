I've been sober, feel like I've been sober all my life
I tread water, and I hold onto things too tight, too tight
Then you come on just like the best drugs baby
You take all over like the best drugs baby

I love that I can get so high on you
Tell him you can meet me on the moon
Pull me through just like the best drugs baby (Whoa)
Feelin' like I'm not the only one
Feelin' like I'm plugged into the sun
You come on just like the best drugs baby (Whoa)
(You come on, whoa whoa, you come on, whoa whoa, you come on just like the best drugs, one two)

I hear music, feels like I'm swimmin' in the sea, in the sea oh oh
Just sweet soul music and it just washes over me
It's all the faith I needed
You come on just like the best drugs baby
You take all over like the best drugs baby

I love that I can get so high on you
Tell him you can meet me on the moon
Pull me through just like the best drugs baby (Whoa)
Feelin' like I'm not the only one
Feelin' like I'm plugged into the sun
You come on just like the best drugs baby (Whoa)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa)
You come on just like the best drugs baby

I can see the beauty in the mess and imperfections
When you're runnin' through me I get pulled in all directions
Swallowed by the beauty and lost in inspiration, alright

I love that I can get so high on you
Tell him you can meet me on the moon
Pull me through just like the best drugs baby (Whoa)
Feelin' like I'm not the only one
Feelin' like I'm plugged into the sun
You come on just like the best drugs baby (Whoa)
I love that I can get so high on you
Tell him you can meet me on the moon
Pull me through just like the best drugs baby (Whoa)
Feelin' like I'm not the only one
Feelin' like I'm plugged into the sun
You take over like the best drugs baby (Whoa)
