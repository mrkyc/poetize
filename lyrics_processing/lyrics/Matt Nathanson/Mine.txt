I was out getting dinner
I got a text from your sister
It's been a while
She said you've been dating
Some kid who's amazing
How was I?

Maybe I'm stunning (stunning)
Maybe you're nothing (nothing)
Maybe I'm spending every day satisfied
Maybe I'm through this (through this)
Or maybe the truth is (truth is)
Maybe there's nothing 'round here that shines
Like it did, like it did
When you were
Mine mine mine mine mine (ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Mine mine mine mine mine (ooh ooh, ooh ooh)

All the ways I tried to run when you were mine
And all the ways I tried to run when you were mine

By the end I was practiced
Yeah you kissed me like an actress
Running lines
Heard you moved to the Sunset
A queen in a sublet
A whole new life
