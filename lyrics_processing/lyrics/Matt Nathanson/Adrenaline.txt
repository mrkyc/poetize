I'd never fall in love with someone else again
If I could only taste your lips and this adrenaline
I'd never leave here, never leave your bed

I forgot how good this could feel
Close my eyes holding the steering wheel
Spilling my confessions, midnight on the 405
We really shouldn't be left alone
The way we get into each other's bones, yeah
Cause you've got your life now and I've got mine

Take me home, I'm dying

I'd never fall in love with someone else again
If I could only taste your lips and this adrenaline
I'd never leave here, never leave your bed
Ah ooh oh (oh oh oh-oh oh-oh)
Ah ooh oh (oh oh oh-oh oh-oh)
I'd never leave here, never leave your bed

You said you still remember the words
To every single song that we heard
Driving California, sky looked like a swimming pool
Ever since you pulled me apart
In darkness in that garden in Echo Park, yeah
Dreams come easy; I just disappear in you

I'd never fall in love with someone else again
If I could only taste your lips and this adrenaline
I'd never leave here, never leave your bed
Ah ooh oh (oh oh oh-oh oh-oh)
Ah ooh oh (oh oh oh-oh oh-oh)
I'd never leave here, never leave your bed

I can't stand it when you're not with me
I can't stand it, I fall at your feet
You're not the answer, but I can't stand defeat
Oh, Lord; oh, Lord

I'd never fall in love with someone else again
If I could only taste your lips and this adrenaline
I'd never leave here, never leave your bed
I'd never fall in love with someone else again
If I could only taste your lips and this adrenaline
