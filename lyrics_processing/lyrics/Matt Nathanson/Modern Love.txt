She said this talking
Kind of wears me out
And all these salesmen
Baby, make me tired
They're no good
To tell you the truth, she said
I've been getting used to liars
These silly love songs
With store bought words
They make me promises
Like politicians
So we stumble
And we disconnect
Over and over again

This modern love is not enough
She said, watch your back
I'm nobodies girlfriend
This modern love is not enough
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
They said one big exhale never did me no, good

I let em in, I
Oh man, I let 'em win
I'd burn my house down
Just to hear them scream my name
I've carried hopes
And heavy daydreams, she said
But I'm done with sleeping
Take the phone calls
Take this circus
Take the drama
'Cause baby it's just worthless

She said, watch your back
I'm nobodies girlfriend
This modern love is not enough
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
They said one big exhale never did me no, good
One big exhale never did me no good

And the bright light shines
Still we ache and we break and we try
Stage light shines
And they blind our eyes
To it all, oh-oh
Still we ache and we break and we just can't get it right

This modern love is not enough
She said, watch your back
I'm nobodies girlfriend
This modern love is not enough
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, this modern love is a taco truck
Come on take the phone calls, baby
I'll take all the silence, yeah
This modern love is not enough
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, one big exhale never did me no good
One exhale
One big exhale, yeah
One exhale never did me no good
