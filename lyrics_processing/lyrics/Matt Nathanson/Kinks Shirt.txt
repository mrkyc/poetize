(Ooh)
Rent love, run in circles
Sweet fiction silhouette
Meet me at 9th and Irving
Let's do things we can both regret
It's all there in your chipped red fingernails
It's all there in the twist of your pigtails
It's the way she walks
The way she talks
Can't stop thinking
About the girl in the kinks shirt
Take me home, San Francisco
Can't stop thinking about the girl in the kinks shirt
You and my imagination
You and my imagination
You and my imagination
Can't stop thinking about the girl in the kinks shirt
(Oooooh)
Sidewalk mariachis
I see you in your party dress
Played out Sid and Nancy
Bring on the apocalypse

Get my truth from your thrift store halo
Getting what you want can break your heart
It's the way she walks
The way she talks
Can't stop thinking
About the girl in the kinks shirt
Take me home, San Francisco
Can't stop thinking about the girl in the kinks shirt
You and my imagination
You and my imagination
You and my imagination
Can't stop thinking about the girl in the kinks shirt
(Ooh)
Getting what you want can break your heart
Getting what you want can break your heart
Getting what you want is gonna break you, is gonna break you, is gonna break your heart
It's the way she walks
The way she talks
Can't stop thinking
About the girl in the kinks shirt
Take me home, San Francisco
Can't stop thinking about the girl in the kinks shirt
You and my imagination
You and my imagination
You and my imagination
Can't stop thinking about the girl in the kinks shirt (Oh)
