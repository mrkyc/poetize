We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
'Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

When did you change?
Wendy, you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never
Window closed
Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

'Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
And she don't laugh the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was always practice
Don't you miss the days, and stranger? Don't you miss the days?
Don't you miss the danger? (Don't you miss the danger?)
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
And she don't laugh the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real and everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids, why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?

We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
And we don't act the same ways no more
