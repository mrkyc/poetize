I was falling through the sky
You whispered to me
Baby hold on tight
I was starting wars
Saying my good-byes
Still you never took your hand from mine
All the stars above our heads
The faster they came
The faster they went
All the stars above our heads
Spin you round through the roar of this crowd tonight, tonight
Dance you round throught the bones of this town until daylight comes
Hope, hope will put the colors in the sky
Hope, hope will set this world of wrong to right, to right
Love comes tumbiling down
Cities made of stone
Sinking in the flood
All the people wait around to rust
All the stars above our heads
The faster they came
The faster they went
All the stars we lose ourselves
