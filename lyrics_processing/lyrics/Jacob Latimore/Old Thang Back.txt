'Cause he don't make her smile for no reason like me
She miss them butterflies in her belly
And she can't remember why we not together
She just want that old thing back, yeah
And she human, so she gon' make some mistakes
To make it up, she do whatever it's gon' take
'Cause she love me like a fat kid loves some cake
She just want that old thing back, yeah

She said she don't want it if it ain't me (It ain't me)
They don't do it for me like I used to, no
And without me, she be feeling like she just can't breathe
Baby, can we link up tonight? Do something tonight
Hit the city, have a little bit of fun tonight
And that's what she's saying to me
But, girl, I gotta check if my schedule is free

'Cause now I'm only rocking big trips, signing big deals
When that money get to calling, baby, I got to peel
She said, "Baby, please don't blow me off, you gotta listen
See, the last time that we talked, I got in my feelings
And I blew it, I was stupid
I was young then, I was foolish
Please forgive me, please be with me
'Cause without you, I feel empty"
