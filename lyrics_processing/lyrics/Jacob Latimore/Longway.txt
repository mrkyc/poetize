Something, something I been thinking
See, it's something I can't keep inside
See, it's something about my foolish pride
I push you aside, I do it outta spite, oh
Gotta say, its been awesome
It's been like 600 days since we been on
Girl, you make me feel like a king, baby
I don't mind, you're my queen, no, no

So don't get irrational, I'm gone for now
You miss me too, I know
Then I get irrational, don't answer me now
Are you fucking around on the low? (On the low, on the low)

Me and you, we been together, that's the strong way (Strong way)
If it ain't lasting forever, that's the wrong way (Wrong way)
If we can't get it together, that's a no say (No say)
Lately it's been getting better
Girl, you know we came a long way, long way, long way
Long way, long way
Girl, I fuck with you the long way, long way, long way
Long way, long way

Talking Summer to Valetine's
All you wanted was my comfort
And you put on for me like a concert
That's my bae, yeah, that's my bae, yeah, yeah
She the bae, yeah, she the bae, yeah, yeah
Oh, na-na-na-na
You get anything you want from me

So don't get irrational, I'm gone for now
You miss me too, I know
Then I get irrational, don't answer me now
Are you fucking around on the low? (On the low, on the low, on the low)

Me and you, we been together, that's the strong way (Strong way)
If it ain't lasting forever, that's the wrong way (Wrong way)
If we can't get it together, that's a no say (No say)
Lately it's been getting better
Girl, you know we came a long way, long way, long way
Long way, long way
Girl, I fuck with you the long way, long way, long way
Long way, long way
Long way, long way, long way
Long way, long way
Long way, long way, long way
