Woah, woah, woah

You're never satisfied
You're never satisfied
I gave you the best of me
Won't let you take the rest of me
If you're never satisfied
You're never satisfied
You're never satisfied
I gave you the best of me (Oh-oh-oh)
Won't let you take the rest of me

Cruisin' around, thinkin' aloud
So, so deeply
I don't hear a sound, tryna figure it out
Giving up's okay sometimes and that's no lie
Especially if it's toxic, that's what I can't rock with
There's no fortune worth a battle sore
I didn't get it all
What you say? What you say? (What you say?)
They can't believe that at all, no way, no way
Influencing minds when you tell those lies
And that ain't right
Heaven knows this heart of mine (Heaven knows this heart of mine)
Take account for your actions (Actions)
Petty, ungrateful actions (Oh)
All I'm really sayin', it's the wrong way to be (All in all)
You can have anything and you still need
You might also like
You're never satisfied
You're never satisfied (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
You're never satisfied
I gave you the best of me
Won't let you take the rest of me (Won't let you take the rest of me)
You're never satisfied
You're never satisfied (Satisfied, baby)
You're never satisfied
I gave you the best of me
Won't let you take the rest of me, yeah

You used to ignore, not feel my friends
Now this story ends where it once began
Now you got me feelin' like this can't be right
Now you got me feelin' like this can't be life
Forgivin' you for everything, I even played dead
Just so you could feel some security there
Kept it transparent so it'd always be clear
Don't turn to your side, look me in my eyes
'Cause you don't tell me you're knockin' jewelry (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I won't be surprised if you send me a four-page letter with that old scent
Here you come, comin' back with that old shit
Oh-oh, outta sight, outta mind (Outta sight, outta mind)
Outta sight, outta mind with you
Take you a breather, I don't wanna make you upset
You always makin' everything into something
You're never satisfied (Satisfied, baby)
You're never satisfied (Ooh, ooh)
I gave you the best of me
Won't let you take the rest of me
You're never satisfied
You're never satisfied (Ooh, ooh, baby)
You're never satisfied
I gave you the best of me
