Baby take it from me, I will never lead you on
I know a lot of dudes before me probably lead you on (Eh, eh)
Telling you whatever you wanna hear, am I right?
And I'm not that type of guy, you can see it in my eyes
(Hook)
So just let go of whatever you holding
And open up I'll catch you, when you start falling
(Chorus)
What are you waiting for?
I'm right here baby, you ain't never gonna have to worry
What are you waiting for?
No rush, baby, all I need for you to do is tell me (tell me)
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
(Verse 2)
No one else would do the things that I would do (Yeah)
And I see more then looks when I see you (yeah)
I know you've been hurt before babe, I see it when you face me
I wanna be the one to change the way you feeling baby
You might also like(Hook)
So just let go of whatever you holding
And open up I'll catch you, when you start falling
(Chorus)
What are you waiting for?
I'm right here baby, you ain't never gonna have to worry
What are you waiting for?
No rush baby, all I need for you to do is tell me (tell me)
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
(Bridge)
Baby you can tell me whatever (yeah)
Go and say it to me
And with me you can do whatever, yeah
I'mma love you babe
(Oh Yeah)
What are you waiting for?
What more do you need to see, babe?
What are you waiting for?
(Hook)
So just let go of whatever you holding
And open up, I'll catch you when you start falling
(Chorus x2)
What are you waiting for?
I'm right here baby, you ain't never gonna have to worry
What are you waiting for?
No rush baby, all I need for you to do is tell me (tell me)
What are you waiting for?
(Ending)
