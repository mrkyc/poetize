To be torn apart
You shouldn't be here alone

You know he can't boomerang
Ok its time to replace him
Ain't no need to finagle
This attraction is fatal
And I'm just laughing at homie
While you just tryna replace him

Specialize in replacements
Ain't no need for the maintenance
Its just in my behaviour

Then dip it back to the...
