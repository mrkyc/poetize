Superhuman, blew me to the sky
Love you, hate you, kiss you, then you'll die
Why be aggravated? Get another one
Oh, I have tried
I'm talkin' no other types, they be fine
Truthfully special ones, I decline, I decline

Time's runnin' away
No, it shouldn't take you longer, no (No)
Even your mind has said okay
Now it's your heart who won't let you go (Go), yeah

Just tell me what's goin' on
You been off goin' back and forth
I been right here, right on point
And if you dare, you should risk me, yeah
You should risk me, risk me
Loving you is risky, risky
I'm telling you to risk me, risk me
I'm telling you that if you dare, you should risk me, yeah
You should risk me

Darling, my baby, I miss you when you're absent
It feels like lightning crashing inside me, yeah
I walk down right by the ocean
And I be hoping and I be hoping
That I'm always on your mind now, night and day
I go crazy by my bed

Time's runnin' away
No, it shouldn't take you longer, no (No)
