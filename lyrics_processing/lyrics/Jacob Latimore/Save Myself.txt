This isn't like what's on the TV screen
This is called life, it's not what you wanna hear
But you know it's right and I speak to you honestly
Instead of me frontin' things, yeah
Your attitude need a depends
Can't keep provoking me
Think I blow it in the wind
Gave you everything except givin' into your shit
You do know that you wrong
So sing this like your favorite song

Love ain't a movie, baby (Baby)
It's not for the faint of heart (Faint of heart, yeah)
Don't make this hard for me, oh no (Oh no)
And I hate to say it, baby, but I told you

If I give you love, then change my mind (Yeah)
Understand it's a vibe that I do like
And I'll save myself over
Anyone of you loves who want my time (Hey, baby)
Understand it's a vibe that I do like
'Til then, I'll save myself for love
You might also like
Is it your pride
That won't let you go away?
And won't let it die
You tell me you leavin', baby
You'll be back tonight
And I'm over that cycle, baby
I won't be recycled, baby
Love me, then hate me
I'm not making you stay with me
I know, oh, that you're wrong
And I won't let it be
And I'ma sing this like your favorite song

Love ain't a movie, baby
It's not for the faint of heart (Faint of heart, yeah)
Don't make this hard for me, oh no (Oh no)
You broke your heart and I told you

If I give you love, then change my mind (Change my mind, yeah)
Understand it's a vibe that I do like
And I'll save myself over
Anyone of you loves who want my time (Any of you loves)
(I know you want my time, baby)
Understand it's a vibe that I do like
'Til then, I'll save myself for love
