Something, ain't it always something
And I bet you girl wouldn't treat me like this
I can't win for nothing
Why you always fussin'?
Something out of nothing
Got me feeling like this
It ain't the same to me
Is that what you wanna hear?
It's changing me
Is that what you wanna hear?
She call me all the time
Is that what you wanna hear?
We argue like all the time

If I do you how you do me then you hate
Then you do it out of spite to debate
Back on my player shit
Yeah, I'm on my player shit
I don't have nothing to prove
I just be making my move

Tell the truth don't lie to my face
I had to usher out your feelings my way (My way)
Well at least you live and learn
What you do ain't my concern
Used to be my superstar
Now you gotta let it burn

Ashes, spread around
Ashes, spread around
It's dead, it's dead
Ashes, spread around
Ashes, spread around
Ashes, spread around
Tell the whole world I ain't coming back

Something, ain't it always something
And I bet you girl wouldn't treat me like this
I can't win for nothing
Why you always fussin'?
Something out of nothing
Got me feeling like this
It ain't the same to me
Is that what you wanna hear?
It's changing me
Is that what you wanna hear?
She call me all the time
Is that what you wanna hear?
We argue like all the time

Got to the point where I had to let it go
The one that point the finger is the one that's doing wrong
Accusing me I think it's tragic
And you like to think you a savage
And what am I do with someone with no understanding, yeah
I don' t want to be the boyfriend type, boyfriend
Well at least you live and learn
What you do ain't my concern
Used to be my superstar
Now you gotta let it burn

Ashes, spread around
Ashes, spread around
Ashes, spread around
It's dead, it's dead
Ashes, spread around
Ashes, spread around
Ashes, spread around
Tell the whole world I ain't coming back girl

Something, ain't it always something
And I bet you girl wouldn't treat me like this
I can't win for nothing
Why you always fussin'?
Something out of nothing
Got me feeling like this
It ain't the same to me
Is that what you wanna hear?
It's changing me
Is that what you wanna hear?
She call me all the time
Is that what you wanna hear?
