Your skin is all I can picture
When I'm not with ya, baby
Your lips tracing my mind
I'm down for the ride, you know what I like
Your love is lifting me higher
My top supplier, I'm the provider
No rush, taking my time, too
Just to remind you it's mine

If I could pull you closer, get my mind right
If you want me closer, meet me on sight
Think that you know how to drive me crazy
That's 'cause you my shawty, you my baby
Don't back down, you know what you gettin'
Right now, you don't wanna miss it (Ooh, ooh)
Be the sounds when we making love (Ooh, ooh)
Be the sounds

Caught up, caught up, caught up in the moment
I'm here for you if you really want it
See, I got you, you got me, time feels like it's slower
When I'm not with you, baby
Caught up, caught up, caught up in the moment
I'm here for you if you really want it
See, I got you, you got me, time feels like it's slower
When I'm not with you, baby

Can you put your phone down on the table? Uh
Prove to me this is where you wanna be
Givin' me all your attention, how can I say no?
You could get anything, just say what you want from me, yeah
Tell me what you want from me

Yeah, if I could pull you closer, get my mind right
If you want me closer, meet me on sight
Love that I know how to drive you crazy
That's 'cause I'm your shawty, you my baby
Don't back down, you know what you gettin'
Right now, you don't wanna miss it (Ooh, ooh)
Be the sounds when we making love (Ooh, ooh)
Be the sounds

Caught up, caught up, caught up in the moment
I'm here for you if you really want it
See, I got you, you got me, time feels like it's slower
When I'm not with you, baby
Caught up, caught up, caught up in the moment
I'm here for you if you really want it
See, I got you, you got me, time feels like it's slower
