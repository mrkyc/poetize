You said that if I keep it real with you, you'd keep it real with me
But every time I do, you always seem to flip the shit on me love
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
I did it for you, what more do you want?

I don't wanna tell no lies
I don't wanna tell no lies to you
But it's feeling like I can't do right
It's feeling like I can't do right with you
I will never waste your time
So tell me why you waste mine?
Preaching shit you can't live by
So how the hell am I the bad guy?

Said if you can't take it
Why say it?
Baby, that's true shit, baby, that's true
'Cause the man you lay with, you made him, baby, that's true shit
Ah, look what you done made me do
(You don't want the truth now, you don't want the truth now)
Look what you done made me do
(You don't want the truth now, you don't want the truth now)
Ah, look what you done made me do
(You don't want the truth now, you don't want the truth now)
Fuck around and lied to you, baby, that's true shit, true shit
You might also like
Said you ready for a real nigga
But you can't deal with a real issue, babe
I said that I wasn't ready but it's too late
We up in this love but you asked for it
Random numbers got you paranoid
In the bushes snapping polaroids
Gave you reasons not to trust the boy, but you love the boy

I don't wanna tell no lies
I don't wanna tell no lies to you
But it's feeling like I can't do right
It's feeling like I can't do right with you
And I will never waste your time
So tell me why you waste mine?
Preaching shit you couldn't live by
So how the hell am I the bad guy?

Said if you can't take it
Why say it?
Baby, that's true shit, baby, that's true
'Cause the man you lay with, you made him
Baby, that's true shit
Ah, look what you done made me
Baby, I got to acknowledge
That me and you both got some problems
But when something ain't going right
You gotta make me a monster
Baby, I'm far from your ex
You can't compare me to that
Girl, I'm as real as it come
But you gotta see for yourself

Said if you can't take it
Why say it?
Baby, that's true shit, baby, that's true
'Cause the man you lay with, you made him, baby, that's true shit
Ah, look what you done made me do
(You don't want the truth now, you don't want the truth now)
Ah, babe, look what you done made me do
(You don't want the truth now, you don't want the truth now)
Ah, look what you done made me do
(You don't want the truth now, you don't want the truth now)
Fuck around and lied to you, baby, that's true shit, true shit

TJ and JL
Ayy, same talk? Ayy
Flying high, and you can't
Help me, 'cause you just, by yourself, and you regret it, babe
Right now you regret it, babe
