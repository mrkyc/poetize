I'm the way I am, mhm
So, baby stop complaining about everything
If you're not gonna do nothing to help
Pre-Chorus:
Girl you knew what it was
When you first got with me
Now the same thing that made you want
That made you wanna leave me
Chorus:
Take it or leave it
Baby I am who I am right now
Take it or leave it
Cause I feel we can give through this somehow
Take it or leave it
Baby I know when we're perfect
Take it or leave it
Baby we've got something worked and leave it
I know I've caused you so much babe
And believe me, if I can take it back I would do that babe, hey
I had tears running down your  face like rain
And girl I tried to make sure that it didn't happen again, yeah
