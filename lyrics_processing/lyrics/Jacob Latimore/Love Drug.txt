One thing I guarantee
Is I'll have your heart racin' off a dose of me
Take me and feel the rush
Senses elevate when you're with me

Let me be your drug
I wanna be your lover
Baby, I can be your friend
And all of the above, girl
I wanna be your drug
Let me be your lover
Baby, I can be your friend
And all of the above, girl

Baby, when I kiss you and you kiss me back
Baby, when I touch you, then you'll touch me back
Baby, when I love you, then you'll love me back
Oh, no, no, no, no
So you can come a little closer, right where you're supposed to be
Baby, when I kiss you and you kiss me back
