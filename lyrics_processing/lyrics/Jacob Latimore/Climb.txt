You're fantasizing, mesmerizing
When you send me pictures I get so excited
And oh
I can't hold back, no
It's just your eyes and, when we vibin'
Can't remember the last time that we were fightin', and oh
I'm gonna have a heart attack
'Cause, girl, you bad, girl, you bad

I like the feeling when you know you feeling sexy
In the bedroom, girl, I know you can impress me
And when we lay down, lay down
And I start from the bottom

And I can't wait to climb, climb, climb, climb
You give the best love ever, and it don't get no better
And when I climb, climb, climb, climb
You give the best love ever, and don't stop now, no never

Oh, it's just us, ain't in no rush
Wrap your legs around my waist under the covers
Let's make love till the sun comes up, yeah
Girl, when you move, all I wanna do is turn you around
I wanna be behind you, our love nobody can touch
They ain't got nothing on us
You might also like
I like the feeling when you know you feeling sexy
In the bedroom, girl, I know you can impress me
And when we lay down, lay down
And I start from the bottom

And I can't wait to climb, climb, climb, climb
You give the best love ever, and it don't get no better
And when I climb, climb, climb, climb
You give the best love ever, and don't stop now, no never

I want it all, I need all your fantasies
Please don't be shy right now, it's just you and me
Anticipating all your wants and your needs
I aim to please
I been waitin' all day to climb, so I'm gonna take my time, yeah
Baby, this might take all night
Are you ready?

And I just can't wait to climb, climb, climb, climb
You give the best love ever, and it don't get no better
And when I climb, climb, climb, climb
