Don't I belong to you
I hold you down right
Don't tell me that I ain't
Cus' that don't sound right
Want you to trust me til' it's all good
And that's for me to earn
But in time you'll see
And you will learn

I know my love is like a boomerang
Throw it all out
Let it come back to me again
I know my sex is like a boomerang
Throw it all out
Let it come back to me again
I know your body's like a boomerang
Throw it all out
Let it come back to me again
I know it all feel like a boomerang
Throw it all out
Let it come back to me again
