I need a little time, a little space
A place to find myself again you know?'
Oh yes, I know a goodbye when I hear it
She smiles
But her heart's already out there
Walking down the street
She says
'I don't want nobody else, I love you'
She's lying
'there won't be somebody else, and that's true'
She's lying
'say you'll always be my friend, sweet darling'
Why does she pretend?
Ain't no doubt, it's plain to see
A woman like you is no good for me
Your heart's beating at another door
I'm a damned fool for to ask for more (ask for more, ask for more)
She says
It's like in a song, remember?
If you love someone, set them free
Well, that's how it is for me
But you know I'll always come back
And then she kisses me
And somewhere I hear a door slam
So I say 'fine'
And just hope that I'm a better liar
Than she is
