Old school flow
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
They used to say
They used to say
This rap shit

They used to say (He's dreamin')

Yeah, I remember it so clearly, rappin' to my pop
About the cars and the clothes, shrimp and the lobster that I heard about
Like word of mouth
The UGK tape and Scarface will turn ya out
I was like thirteen thirsting for a good beat
Scoping for a studio talkin' bout I spit heat
Like Ball & G, on that pimp-type shit
Three 6 had me crunk on that late night tip

I played ball for a minute, did I mention, wasn't in it?
Writing rhymes on my glove so I won't ever forget em
Had to quit it, didn't feel it back in high school
Rather write poems, known for flowing, that's what I do
Couldn't be little Zac forever, peace to my big brother
Follow your dreams, baby, that's word to my grandmother
Well, I hear the streets tappin' out beats, kickin' my flow
I overhear the same shit they always say before

That (He's dreamin')
They used to say (He's dreamin')
This rap shit (Is not for real)

I told 'em call me KRIT, they told me change my name
Don't be alarmed if you don't make it, that's just part of the game
Besides, I ain't rapping 'bout dope nor did I sell it
I guess the story of a country boy just ain't compelling
A&Rs searching for a hit, I just need a meal
Couldn't afford to pay the rent, but passed up on the deal, 'cause
It wasn't right, sometimes you gotta wade the storm
In a class of my own, but I was scared to raise my arm, like
This my dream, this my life, I sacrificed it all
Except my soul in the firm belief there is a God
Watching out when all the others used to doubt
Felt my pain and pointed down and said, "Son, your time is now"
I think my grandma pulled some strings on the low
But that's between her and the Lord, I'll never know
For those that caught me in the Spin, in Complex magazine
XXL, the Vibe and whatever in-between
It's safe to say that dreams come true, I guess
Don't let nobody tell ya, try for yourself
Just know that I was once considered just a dreamer
But I paid my dues and turned so many doubters to believers

They used to say
They used to say
They used to say
They used to say
He's dreamin'
He's dreamin'
Is not for real
Is not for real
He's dreamin'
He's dreamin'
Is not for real
Is not for real

I don't care if it is a dream
I've got to believe in something, my love
What can I do? What have I got to lose?
You know, sometimes dreams do come true
