Back one more again
Multi till the sun die
UGK for life
Good lord, good lord
It feels good to shine
Shine
Let's go

By the time you probably heard this
I was on another verse bitch
Diamonds in the back with curtains
Breaking hoes off, I never dose off at my post
Never disrespect your host, or bite the hand that feed ya
Cufflinks cold as Ebenezer, my momma probably should of named me Caesar
Cleaner than a baptist preacher
That use to pimp
Gator shoes don't make the man
So primp primp
So keep on with that, like I won't whip back
Around in that lac, that you done seen
Don't worry about this, I'm serious about this
If you know what I mean
Shine on
You might also like
Shine on
Don't get me wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we shining on
It's way too strong
Yeah, yeah, shine on
Good Lord they know it
Now, now, we shining on
Ain't nobody tripping 'cause the money already made

So lately I've been observing
A lot of these niggas look nervous
Come on in, don't be ashamed
Go and steal some game from my sermon
'Cause elevation to celebration, I preach that there
And that bullshit that they serving y'all, I don't eat that there
Keep that plate, I got my own
Don't test my patience, bitch, I'm grown
It ain't much you can tell me Granny ain't already told me
And she wasn't wrong, yeah, we that strong
So fuck your umbrella, rainy weather, and all that shade
If God ain't want me to shine, he never would've let me chop on blades
So shine on

Shine on
Don't get me wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we shining on
It's way too strong
Yeah, yeah, shine on
Good Lord they know it
Now, now, we shining on
Ain't nobody tripping 'cause the money already made
They say man make money, money don't make the man
But it's a little bit of both
'Cause it will take some change, for you to make some change
That ain't just some shit I wrote
Man, that's natural fact, and not evolution
My mind game still evolving
And I'm gonna keep on rolling like 24's
And this world just keep revolving
Good at problem solving, 'cause I'm good at starting shit in first place
And it feels so good to be where I'm at man
'Cause where I was, was the worst place
But time change, so I keep hustling
Boys trying to make my time cease
But I'm laid back with my dime piece
Shining hard like my time piece and its on

Shine on
Don't get me wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we shining on
It's way too strong
Yeah, yeah, shine on
Good Lord they know it
Now, now, we shining on
Ain't nobody tripping 'cause the money already made
Shine baby
Shine baby
Shine baby
I need you to come on one more time and just shine babe
Shine baby
Shine baby
Shine baby
I need you to do it like you do and just shine baby
Shine baby
Shine baby
Shine baby
One more time for all my folk 'm gone shine babe
Shine baby
Shine baby
Shine baby
They can't stop me from shining on my own
(Ain't no shining like we shining
Ain't no shining like we shining
Ain't no shining like we shining
Ain't no shining like we shining
Ain't no shining like we shining
Ain't no shining like we shining
Ain't no shining like we shining
Ain't no shining like we shining, babe)

Shine on
Don't get me wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we shining on
It's way too strong
Yeah, yeah, shine on
Good Lord they know it
Now, now, we shining on
