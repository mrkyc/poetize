Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, I'm Big K.R.I.T. and I'm a meditator
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It wasn't easy to come in today, but I'm here (I just wanna meditate)

I don't wanna hear what I've done wrong
I'll deal with my problems when I get home
I'm better off when I'm all alone
I know I said I'd stop, but I'm not that strong
I just wanna meditate, oh (I just wanna meditate, meditate, I just wanna meditate, meditate)
I just wanna meditate, oh (I just wanna meditate, meditate, I just wanna meditate, meditate)
I just wanna meditate, oh (I just wanna meditate, meditate, I just wanna meditate, meditate)
I just wanna meditate, oh (I just wanna meditate, meditate, I just wanna meditate, meditate)
I just wanna meditate

Said it with this glass of liquor pouring out my spiritual guidelight, take me to the other side
Whoever said escaping your problems with empty bottles would only delay them 'til tomorrow? Yes, was surely right
When the world said fuck ya, how would you reply?
No need to whisper how you feel, this is you and I
I paint pictures of hieroglyphics compared to most rap niggas
But I be overlooked, so I just let it slide, let it die, how can I
Be so stupid to tell you this wasn't real?
Be so eager to tell you just how I feel?
But let's be honest, the real reason I'm here
To be clear, I was never the man of steel
I fell victim too many times to count
Too many times I've died, too many things I doubt
Not enough love in my house, my house is not enough
It's filled with pointless things and those things keep piling up
Those things'll leave you crushed if they fall
To be real, I don't think you feel me at all
Can you hear me at all? Can you steer me at all? To the liquor store

I don't wanna hear what I've done wrong
I'll deal with my problems when I get home
I'm better off when I'm all alone
I know I said I'd stop, but I'm not that strong
I just wanna meditate, oh (I just wanna meditate, meditate, I just wanna meditate, meditate)
I just wanna meditate, oh (I just wanna meditate, meditate, I just wanna meditate, meditate)
I just wanna meditate, oh (I just wanna meditate, meditate, I just wanna meditate, meditate)
I just wanna meditate, oh (I just wanna meditate, meditate, I just wanna meditate, meditate)
I just wanna meditate

How can I stop when I'm too far gone to get back where I came from?
I was searching for some answers at a bar with some dancers and I found out there really ain't none
And the bottom of my glass is just as empty as my last encounter with my friends and my loved ones
All my exes hate my guts 'cause when I finally call them up, they know that I just wanna fuck somethin'
I apologize, for what? I don't know
Too many times I did it and it shows, I feel it in my soul
There's a burning in my stomach and it's churning in slow
And it grows every time I hit a low
If you're out, I was hoping we could roll
If you fiendin' for a drink, let me pour
If you ridin', maybe we can go
Before they close, to the liquor store

I don't wanna hear what I've done wrong
I'll deal with my problems when I get home
I'm better off when I'm all alone
I know I said I'd stop, but I'm not that strong
I just wanna meditate, oh (I just wanna meditate, meditate, I just wanna meditate, meditate)
I just wanna meditate, oh (I just wanna meditate, meditate, I just wanna meditate, meditate)
I just wanna meditate, oh (I just wanna meditate, meditate, I just wanna meditate, meditate)
I just wanna meditate, oh (I just wanna meditate, meditate, I just wanna meditate, meditate)
I just wanna meditate
So I sit here and I think back on all the things that I wanted in life and all the things that I've accomplished
I'm more fulfilled then I ever have been before
I still lose, I've still lost, but I love, and I'm living
There's nothing better in this world to be for sure
And I'm sure, I'm sure enough of what I do and how I do it
There's a lot of people around me that believe in me and I depend on them to see me through this, this life of mine
Let's hope this journey that we take, all these moves that we make are the right ones
