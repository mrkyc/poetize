Anybody sayin that I ain't the best
Then I am out
Tell these niggas when I ball out
I'ma need an ATM in my house
I ain't gonna waste another day again on my couch
Tell these niggas when I ball out
I'ma need an ATM in my house, bounce
Anybody sayin that I ain't the best
Then I am out
Tell these niggas when I ball out
I'ma need an ATM in my house
I ain't gonna waste another day again on my couch
Tell these niggas when I ball out
I'ma need an ATM in my house, bounce

I'm tryna get it right now
Do it like a alien, I fly out
Bags of lemonade requested by 
 to the train
A death from 
My sound got these motherfuckers lookin' like clowns
'Cause my mind's bright like a light in a lighthouse
Stand my ground
You will never see me lie down if I wile out
I'ma button niggas like sound, man down
It's a vacay to a space station
Take aim with your brain in your main frame 
So why would I wanna trade places?
I'ma never change like I ain't aging
You are never gonna see me in the same placement
Gimme your paycheck, nah a days wages
And my name's ancient but I ain't major
Say this, wanna play games but I ain't playin'
Slay em

I give you the best in me
I blessed beats when I was in Eskibeat
Rest in peace to your rap  next in scene
Misspin MC like a roulette machine
Who wrecks the scene like me
Technically to you niggas
Shit ain't what it's meant to be
Y'all know we better than
Anybody that you ever seen
And I'm fresh like I'm livin' in a new century
 to me
Fool keep thinkin' I'm cool
Til I eat tar like a spacecraft in reentry
This shit is daft, the nigga it's meant for me
I'm a big dog, we ain't the same pedigree
And you think I spit 
'Cause I'm bright like a flashback or a memory
I've been doin' this back since I was sittin' assembly
With a backpack full of lemony
Anybody sayin that I ain't the best
Then I am out
Tell these niggas when I ball out
I'ma need an ATM in my house
I ain't gonna waste another day again on my couch
