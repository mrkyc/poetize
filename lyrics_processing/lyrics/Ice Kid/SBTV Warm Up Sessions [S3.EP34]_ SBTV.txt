Yeah .. Look..
I got a rap habit I try to relax but then I relapse and now I'm back at it
Like a crack addict pants saggin rag matching my red and black dassis' mad patterns
Black ad' backwards snap back swagging
Something in my rucksack for you flapjack faggots I leave ya
Snap back tattered when I clap that cannon
Tryn'a
Jump on my back on my amtrack carriage I'll have a nigga lookin' like a threw a flashbang at 'im
Shocked as fuck and through my nigga nine they could'a locked him up I'm dropping dubs one after the other like an omnibus. what's the rush, where you gonna run to when the monster comes? no stoppin' us
Drop a bomb on ya worse than hiroshima
This ain't leisure this is demonic posession, alot of my melodical methods are hotter than peba stop being clever
You wanna be better
Watching my setup
And I'm just tryn'a find a way out like I'm locked in a cellar moment of truth, cold and abused broken and bruised holdin a few hopeless and blue like my soul's been removed. notice my holes in my shoes still I glow like the moon and I was drinking special K and smoking Jo as a youth. so go on fuck your lyrics I get drunk and livid and I summon spirits -
Like you wanna fuck with this nigga then come an' get 'im
Ganja resin
All up in my lungs I'm stressing and I've wished to die so many times now I'm like fuck a death wish
Ice Kid's dead
We recalled to the shrines address
A little drivin' west
At 5 to 10 Ice Kid was found lifeless besides his bed
Get used to the swagger, you better man up
Cudda truth is I'm badder than you and your ganga
