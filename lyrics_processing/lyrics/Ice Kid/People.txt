(catch a vibe... yeah)
Catch a vibe with my people
I eat and I drink and get high with my people
I'ma ride with my people
And always vow to live it up 'til I die with my people
I wild and my people tell me I should stick to the road like i'm driving a vehicle
Trying to do right by my people
While all your riders be the type to mislead you
Never fight with my people
And no matter what I'ma side with my people
Mind how you talk you could say the wrong thing
And a bullet might fly for my people
My people keep it 100 and all of your fucking advice is just see through
All of your people are liars
My people just ain't the type to believe you

These days motherfuckers would rather hate than love ya
I don't trust nobody but my cousin and my baby brother
God told me to stay away from you snakey fuckers
I'm from a borough where your friend will fuck your baby mother
Somebody tell me what the fuck is this we live in?
Self obsessed brothers self obsessed women
Questioning themselves and hate is with them
Before you judge as well look yourself in the mirror nigga
You're the one that needs to find the answers
Thinking back to when my cousin nearly died of cancer
And all I wanted was to make it better
So we sat down and then we prayed together
Feeling like I've never seen a rainbow ever
While I'm looking at the rain fall
Like I hate this weather
My younger days were full of strain and terror
Now we in a fucking elevator trying to make some cheddar
Man I've been doing this since me and James Eaton
Was in the crib smoking while gettin' brain from the same skeeze
That was my main G-zy and we stayed even
Though I ain't seen him I just hope his soul's in safe keeping
Designated to where this plane leaves me
Giving you these brain teasers you can take heed in
Niggas losing face I can see your paint leaking
If they ever try and fucking cross me man I ain't Jesus
Got me trying to figure out where the hell your soul is
I seen niggas when they was stressed and broken
Run in to a bit of bread and butter
And turn on the same niggas that fed and clothed him
Jokers I guess we never notice
Niggas had their own motives but he never showed it
Man I got my semi loaded up for any culprit
I wonder if these niggas know that they've already blown it
I swear down I was packing up to finish
Then Wiley flew me out to Canada for Christmas
Put me in a motherfucking Hilton
Anybody dissing my don I don't feel them
Showed me what having a big brother's like
How the grass is greener on the other side
Feeling like I couldn't wait to die
I don't think he knows it but that nigga saved my life
Thank you
Holding this gift in my soul
I was running through the motherfucking 6 with my woes
Feel sick any time I think of my foes
I don't want to have to push a full clip through your dome
(yeah... yeah... yeah... yes)
Stick to the roads and its hard to give a worry
Half these niggas on me didn't holla back then
But now you're asking niggas for me
I've stopped bunnin' halves my nigga, sorry
Big up  was like a father figure to me
You won't see me stop until I pass a nigga probably
Bitch niggas digging up my fucking past like its a body
This ain't the same Ice from Holland Park ya likkle wally
Keep thinking i'm soggy 'til ya see me masked up with a shotty
(yeah)
