I like, making you so happy!

Yo, life and debt, light a cigarette smoke the stress
Take a deep breath baby, let's rearrange the mess we've inherited
Alienated from what is rightfully yours and mine
Land is life, money is time
Paid for labor
Working eight to five, sometimes six seven eight
We come home and barely know the neighbors
Bills are usually late
Interest accumulates at a usury rate
Collection agency waits from
Pay check to next one, budget like a noose
Working while we sing the proletariat blues
On 501-C3 community plantations
Non profit sector propped up to kill the movement
For the changes in production relations
But woman you're my comrade, ride and die, revolution-making mother earth
Standing with me in the grocery line
While I'm paying with a jar of pennies, nickels, and dimes

And I love how you don't like art without a message
I love it how you call some fellas on they fetish
Third world sister, never sacrificing substance for style
But stylish with a golden type smile
I love it how you organize with other strong sisters
Love it how you talk about tearing down the system
Like a soldier, my dialectical reflection
"Yes" is the answer to your question
You might also like
Life and debt, write another check to the landlord
No time to dwell on all the things we can't afford
Got a baby in the womb, a soldier for the future that we're fighting for
Concrete conditions that I'm writin for
The payback, it's way past due
And they say that the masses ain't ready but
We know that ain't true
You and I both children of Filipino immigrants
From the same island, our ancestors smiling
Cuz we found one another in a strange land struggling
Moms tryin' to tell us not to protest instead pray for peace
But that ain't the nature of the beast
So lady grab the bullhorn and take it to the streets
Yellin power to the people, el pueblo unido jamas sera vencido
Til the wealth is spread equal
You 21st century Gabriela Silang
Fierce like Lorena with a rifle in her arms

And I love how you love the people as much as self
I love it how you want redistribution of the wealth
Third world sister, never sacrificing substance for style
But stylish with a golden type smile
I love it how you organize with other strong sisters
Love it how you talk about tearing down the system
Like a soldier, my dialectical reflection
"Yes" is the answer to your question
Life and debt
I like, making you so happy!
I like, making you so happy!
I like, making you so happy!
Cuz making you so happy makes me happy too!
