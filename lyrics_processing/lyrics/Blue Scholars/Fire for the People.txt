More fire for the people
More fire for the people
More fire for the people

Now what I spit, its medicine for the sick
An attempt to get a grip before it all starts to slip
It be the call and response from the bottomless pit
I remain nonchalant when the drama get thick
The last call, ballin up my palm in a fist
The most common misperception is this
Drop a tape, rock a show, sign a line
Hit the road, hit some hoes, videos
Next you know you'll be ballin' and shit
But you'll be callin' it quits
When all the cards start to fall in a ditch
Cuz temptation is so hard to resist
Know there's no such thing as an unjustified existence
Except perhaps a few thousand rappers in this business
Finish what I start, scientifically, strategically
Specifically addressing the oblivion we livin in
My brethren and sisteren, I'm speaking, are you listening?
Freedom been imprisoned by the television image
If you let it instead, get affected by your habitat
Ask a few questions, quit a few bad habits
And after that handle this, similar to how Xavier McDaniel did in '86
We're talking just a little less shit
And lately been mindful of the babies I admit
But at nighttime I sit, serenaded by the blues of the skyline hue
Reminded me of the time when the old was new, and I
You might also like
Spark a fire for the cold in the dark
Peace and war, both pumpin' soul in my heart
And no they can't keep what they stole from the art
And they love to see beef cuz it throws us apart
More fire for the people (more fire for the people)
Say more jobs for the people (more jobs for the people)
And more books for the people (more books for the people)
And more music for the people (more music for the people)

As the world hurls toward seven billion more listeners
Seven hundred plus either killed or held prisoners
Seven thousand one hundred islands I been missin
Cuz I grind from seven to five
I don't write the scriptures
As hot as the block gets its cold contradiction
Pen drips with honesty, I don't offer fiction
Throw competition the bone that they try to pick with me
And learn the moral lesson and marchin' forward to victory
No flag wavin' celebratin' your invasion
You call it thanksgiving, we call it things taken
Everyone lookin for the ladder, not the answer to the question
Waitin' til the cancers in regression
Fresh from the northwest, the hottest thing lately
Like white celebrities buying black and brown babies
Got the town crazy over beats rhymes and life
Peace with Adobo grease, eggs, and brown rice
And I....
Spark a fire for the cold in the dark
Peace and war, both pumpin' soul in my heart
And no they can't keep what they stole from the art
And they love to see beef cuz it throws us apart
More fire for the people (more fire for the people)
Say more jobs for the people (more jobs for the people)
And more books for the people (more books for the people)
More clothes for the people (more clothes for the people)
More schools for the people (more schools for the people)
More land for the people (more land for the people)
More life for the people (and more life for the people)

Yo
I've seen souls get sold so coldly
Seen what a dollar can do to the tired and true
I speak boldly, composed of a melody told
Whenever we hold the memory close
No tellin' when the reaper finna post
And snatch a fan
Something that you can't capture with a camera lens
Amalgamation of the bolo and the hammer and pen
The truth hurts, no wonder the people rather pretend
I annihilate a fake persona for spare change
Everybody self included is fair game
Inherited the trait to make both ends meet
Often make a brother feel like he gotta compete
But with each release I reach for peace
Others quick to reach for the piece from here to beacon to beach
You see, freedom of speech don't apply if you're silent
I shout like I'm trying to get heard on the Island, I
Spark a fire for the cold in the dark
Peace and war, both pumpin' soul in my heart
And no they can't keep what they stole from the art
And they love to see beef cuz it throws us apart
More fire for the people (more fire for the people)
More peace for the people (more peace for the people)
More life for the people (more life for the people)
More love for the people (more love for the people)
More love for the people (more love for the people)
More love for the people (more love for the people)
