Sendin' this one out..
Alright yo, yo, yo

My wounded eyes seen through the lies, many soon to die
Who am I? A student, I study to survive
Wounded eyes seen through the lies, many soon to die
Who am I? A student

I'm listening to the music of the countryside circling the city for the victory
Liquor shop philosophy: scary, but necessary
Pops was a military man, and seein' what it did to him and fam, it was never in my plans
My method is one hand open and one fisted, skin burnt like the sun kissed it
Consistently committed to community-building, they could never put the theory into practice
Who are they to be illin'? I made a killing, not for profit but respect
And unless it's for a benefit you better cut the check
Dude, compensations for the blood and the sweat, see I do for my people cause I love 'em to death
In my geography, you gotta be smart, boss, it's crucial
Paranoid, don't smoke as much as I used to
Even more broke than before we made music, but maybe one day we'll get through it

Now, my wounded eyes seen through the lies, many soon to die
Who am I? A student, I study to survive
Wounded eyes seen through the lies, many soon to die
Who am I? A student, I study to survive
Wounded eyes seen through the lies, many brutalized
So we rise and fight for the future we strive
Wounded eyes seen through the lies, many soon to die
Who am I? A student
You might also like
Observing my environment to see contradictions in concrete conditions
Evidence we're living in an obsolete system, poverty-stricken, folks constantly live in hope
American dreams danglin' from a rope, I got folks working in the public school sector
Who lose one youth to death per semester, I guess the cost of living is going up
While the chance of living is going down, what the fuck is the basis?
I'm saying never no more, the solution for the poor, recruit 'em for the war
They kicked in the door, waving the .45 cal, one million died, I survived, now alive
I reside where the struggle and the hustle coincide, and this moment in time, a shift in the tide
Get the blindfold lifted from your eyes, and see what we see, and stop pretending it's all right man

My wounded eyes seen through the lies, many soon to die
Who am I? A student, I study to survive
Wounded eyes seen through the lies, many soon to die
Who am I? A student, I study to survive
Wounded eyes seen through the lies, many brutalized
So we rise and we fight for the future we strive
Wounded eyes seen through the lies, many soon to die
Who am I? Who am I yo?
