Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha
One-two yo, one-two yo
Ch-check- check one, two yo
It goes microphone check one-two yo
Microphone check one one two-two
It's the cornerstone...

From the gutter to the throne, corner to the stone
Camaraderie is earned, cultivated, and homegrown
Don't really own a damn thing except for my labor
And maybe a couple of thousand pages of my rhymes
And your brain's just a cage with the mind locked inside it unless
Knowledge itself gives proper perspective to see
How the politicians keep the dollars protected
My namesake is not confined to scholarly methods
To reach the mass, never preached the way they teach in class
Sleep-walking half-dead spirits leaving fast
If you've never had your ass beat, brah, you can't speak about
Nonviolent protests and other such mythology
Watch how the quantity leads into quality
Deep beyond the reaches of your Babylon economy
I speak solemnly, I seek equality, my people celebrate life despite poverty
Fuck the false prophecy, promising we'll all be free
As long as we fall in line with the flawed philosophy and
Mystery, God's eternal afterlife in heaven
While living in hell, where the militant dwell
Now the ranks start to swell in the hoods and jail cells
Lock down the campus cause its right to rebel
No uprising fails, each one's a step forward
Toward the victory that's at the end of the trail, we

Crack jokes while singing the blues
And rock like the stone that the builders refused
To all area crews, who carry the world
On their shoulders, on some Atlas shit, this one's for you
206, rock rock on
The proletariat, rock rock on
Beacon Hill, rock rock on
Now the hustle on the corner sets the struggle in stone

My compatriots and comrades, engaging in combat
Trying to stay sane up in this land gone mad
Give me two bucks, you take a puff and pass my bong back
Nearly three years and they're still up in Baghdad
Battle-raps, 85%, talkin' this and that, quit that, insecure petty little man
Get a manicure and tan, B, amateurish candy raps
It's hilarious, I'm laughing 'til I can't breathe
Can it be that it was never simpler then as now?
Consumers waiting for a magazine to set the style
The critical instead begin to organize quietly
Underneath the sugar-coated surface of society
My purpose as of now to serve the people to the fullest
Knowing that my name is somewhere written on a bullet
The beats that I inherited and rhymes in my chromosomes
Passed to my seed, I call him my cornerstone
We crack jokes while singing the blues
And rock like the stone that the builders refused
To all area crews, who carry the world
On their shoulders, on some Atlas shit, this one's for you
New people y'all, rock rock on
Real change, man, rock rock on
The next generation, rock rock on
Now the hustle on the corner sets the struggle in stone
We crack jokes while singing the blues
And rock like the stone that the builders refused
To all area crews, who carry the world
On their shoulders, on some Atlas shit, this one's for you
Central district, rock rock on
U district, rock rock on
International district, rock rock on
Now the hustle on the corner sets the struggle in stone

B-Town, rock rock on
White Center yo, rock rock on
Bellingham yo, rock rock on
Tacoma y'all, rock rock on
Yo Portland, rock rock on
Pacific Northwest, rock rock on
 rock rock on
Real People, y'all rock rock on
The Pioneers yo, rock rock on
