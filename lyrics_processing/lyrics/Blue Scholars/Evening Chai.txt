(Hm? Alright)
Hit 'em with the morning tea (I got it, man)
Had a full day (I was going to take this little walk)
Now we go home and sip some evening chai (Back home, same route that I took to get here)
But first, I'm going to share a little bit of my observations while on the way home with you (Take out my pad and my pen)
Let's go (Take out my pad and my pen)

I taste the evening and breath in the crisp Pacific Northwest air
As it's leavin' my lips, crack the bits
This visual kiss, the Puget Sound
And the bluest of skies
Two sides of the abyss
This city was built on the backs of the brave
Who gave up their home for a dollar a day
The same folks who rose up, demanded minimum wage
Unofficial slaves not given a page
A photograph or a paragraph, written to claim them
Some got the nerve to say "Go back to where you came from"
Same ones who stole the land from Chief Sealth
And then named the city after him
As if to say "We honor you"
Right after we conquer you and pillage your home
Soil fertilize with indigenous bones
Jimi Hendrix, Ray Charles, and Quincy Jones
Japanese jazz, and now hip hop and poems
At 7th and Jackson, the microphone's open
Subvert a culture genocide seven years goin'
You might also like
In the moment and the music
Time to show and prove it
Never will you see me be a Judas to the movement
Used to be a student of the beat until I mastered it
And then I set it free to let it be the energy
That I command when I spit
Illest shit heard out of mangled, tight lips
I like sisters with hips, I like sisters with hopes
Even better than those
Blow spirits through the smoke out my mouth and my nose

I pose questions like "Why folks wear locs at night?"
Either to look swass or the moon is too bright
These dudes with tight shirts and spiked hair
Hit up the late-night Chinese joint with fanfare
Fresh off the club, one stumblin' drunk
Ain't worth my time, just a mumblin' punk
And he be acting like a chump but he still my brown brother
Sister by your side dyed hair with fake eyes
Probably wonders why she attracts the fake guys
I sigh under Southside night skies
My people, young, brown, and gifted conversely
The people I belong to, believe me, it hurts me
To use the same fist that I raise against the system
To cock back and hit 'em
Getting all caught up in the moment and the music
Time to show and prove it
Never will you see me be a Judas to the movement
Used to be a student of the beat until I mastered it
And then I set it free to let it be the energy
That I command when I spit
Illest shit heard out of mangled, tight lips
I like sisters with hips, I like sisters with hopes
Even better than those
Blow spirits through the smoke out my mouth and my nose
And then I breathe
Out my mouth and my nose, and then I breathe (Breathe)
Out my mouth and my nose, and then I breathe
