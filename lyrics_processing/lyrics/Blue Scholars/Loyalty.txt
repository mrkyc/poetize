Patience, understanding, loyalty, loyalty
Bayani, loyalty (got to have)

It's more than just a hobby or pastime
Cause 24/7 I'm representin' the Massline
Daily grind, 85, wonder why, maybe I'm
Way behind lately been occupyin' my mind
With the possibility this means we'll all end
With two albums and a handful of people I call friends
And friends I call my comrades, and comrades who stand
Together write a book 'till it ends
Indeed as we be headed in directions getting whole towns polarized
Either love it or leave it, indeed I'm giving credit to the fam who believed it
Preceding the hype of the hyperbole of the media
Even though some people abandon ship on the other hand
Some were skeptical quick, but now they quick to bandwagon up
Saggin' my pants at the cocktail party with the mayor
And later rockin' a party with a thousand in the air
That's a beautiful thing, and if you're new to this thing
Don't front, ask a question, stay humble, do your thing
But just remember you ain't gotta prove a thing
Stand up or fall down thanks for listenin' y'all

Because I, got your back even if you don't got mine
Grind in the dark when the clock strikes hard times
We ain't nothing if this bond ain't solidified
Give thanks in war time that people still alive
Dignified soldiers who walk with the spirit of 12 million plus lost and found in this lyric
Sound man turn it till the whole town hear it
Either stand up or fall down now if you feel it
Stand up or fall down
Stand up or fall down
While the record goes round stand up or fall down
Stand up or fall down
Stand up or fall down
While the record goes round let the whole town know that it's us
You might also like
Somebody tell me where the riders and the soldiers are
Before they close the door and go and start a colder war
I see 'em posted up in corner stores holdin' fort
Hopin' for a life from the crack of an open door
And so the storm comes to cleanse without warn
While the youth play with fire just to keep themselves warm
In a cold world, cold people, playin' cold songs
Sold for spare change while the broke hold on
Why they call themselves right, but then act so wrong
Dollar sign challenge why the unemployment line long
No call for the blue collar gettin' low ball
It's a long climb just to get to petty bourgeois
While we, gettin' lifted but forgettin' that we fall
Hit and shake cause your movin' but without the roll call
This is protracted struggle revolutionized patience
Bump this on your right wing radio station
And maybe crack a top 10 daily rotation but until then
You can keep ignorin' what I'm sayin'
But just remember you ain't gotta prove a thing
Stand up or fall down thanks for listenin' y'all

Because I, got your back even if you don't got mine
Grind in the dark when the clock strikes hard times
We ain't nothing if this bond ain't solidified
Give thanks in war time that people still alive
Dignified soldiers who walk with the spirit of 12 million plus lost and found in this lyric
Sound man turn it till the whole town hear it
Either stand up or fall down now if you feel it
Stand up or fall down
Stand up or fall down
While the record goes round stand up or fall down
Stand up or fall down
Stand up or fall down
While the record goes round let the whole town know that it's us
Patience, understanding, loyalty, loyalty
Bayani, loyalty (got to have)
