Yeah, now uh
Turn off your radio
Turn up your stereo
Northwest rock, rock on, whats the scenario?
Four years ago two students skipped a class, went and crafted an album, some called it a classic, but
We've grown past, it was good while it lasted
Now it's time to put the education into practice
Beats, rhymes, rice be the breakfast of champions
We hold the whole town down together with the plan to hold the mic with compassion like Yuri did Malcolm
Traveled down the coast since we dropped the last album
That plus one is how long we've been war-torn
It's the return of the hard-knock and hardcore
From hard rock to hip-hop
The migration of flocks who once mocked what we ride for
It's a psy-war, from sidewalks to billboards and stores telling all poor people that the world is yours
But this money is ours, you can get a little back
You start putting in hours, you can widen the gap
But you can see it in the towers standing next to the squatters who be wandering the city in search of a job offer
The first generation in the U.S. of A. to get paid less wage then the ones who came before the wicked waged war in the dessert terrain 24 short bars couldn't measure the pain, so now I
Greet the neighbor daily
He's on his porch, smoking
Overhead, thunderclouds move in slow motion
Came across an ocean in hope of some better days
Expatriated citizens of third-world decay
Where children translate for their parents sake in a landscape where the working class can't escape
These languages twisted
Tongues get unraveled
Can't understand each other in this modern day babel
Now we trying to get a piece of what the city broke down
Barely claiming families but quick to claim the town
Recognize its serious but ain't afraid to clown
Trained for confrontation there's no other way around
These sacred ground desecrators
They tried to decimate us
They hit the ballot like the mayor's gonna save us and
It pains me to say this but pain is what made this
It's gonna take more than just rain to change this
