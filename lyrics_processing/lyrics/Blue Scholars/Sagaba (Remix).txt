Sister sits on the steps, cigarette rests on fingertips
Sipping slow death through her lips
Blows a kiss that I cannot resist
She got that ill gift of gravity, thick
Like the tension cut quick with formalities
Hi, my name is Geo, what's your zodiac sign?
She replies, it's Aquarius and that's a whack line
Decline the invitation to partake in a square
Mesmerized, smoke dissipates in the air
I can conjure up the fearlessness defined in conversation
Body language talking, but lost in the translation of her name
She said brothers tend to mispronounce it, it's Sagaba
Tells me what it means, in Ilocano, it translates into suffering
I'm pondering the irony, building on our so-called civilized society
The storyteller stops, waiting for the beat to drop
Gathering his thoughts in a cloud breathing out

It's like that y'all, it's like this, y'all
It's like that y'all, it's like this, y'all
It's like that y'all, it's like this, y'all
It's like that y'all, it's like this, y'all
It's like that y'all, it's like this, y'all
It's like that y'all, it's like this, y'all
It's like that y'all, it's like this, y'all
It's like that y'all, it's like this...

Now I couldn't stand to see the queen
Breathe her dreams away
Either way we go things are gonna be okay, so they say
Said that I used to know a sister just like you
Beautiful but jaded by the multitude of men who'd often try to
Justify their lies with
Manhood-deficient, twisted notions of survival
Insecure, seeing even lovers as the rivals
And hiding behind the armor when karma completes her cycle
I'm sick of all this metaphor philosophy
You got a man, what's your man got to do with me?
You see between you and I is a thin line we stand by
But if we ever find ourselves on the other side
Then time will stand still and whole worlds will collide
We hardly know ourselves if we've got nothin' to ride for
A struggle to live to the fullest and die for
And make love and wage war for

It's like that y'all, it's like this c'mon
It's like that y'all, it's like this, y'all
It's like that y'all, it's like this c'mon
It's like that y'all, it's like this
It's like that y'all, it's like this
It's like that y'all, it's like this y'all
It's like that y'all, c'mon
It's like that y'all, it's like this
Dreams be the ashes burned, thrashing in the wind
Flying from the burning bush flung from her fingers
And it hung in the air, in this moment of truth
Then it crashed into flames like the end of our youth
We getting trapped in abstractions, reality bites back
We casually fight, lacking the insight to spite that
Opposites attract, but if not we stay honest
She told me that it's better to be critical than conscious
My sister, your fist is more symbolic than you know
And use it as a weapon if he calls you a...
Hold up, did I mention I'm a Pisces
But all these other fish up in the sea will never love you like me?
Inhale - the imagery, a queen walking steadily
Hips sway sweetly to an old soul melody
I hold this memory close, she kept walkin'
And that's when I wrote the first line to this song like...

It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
