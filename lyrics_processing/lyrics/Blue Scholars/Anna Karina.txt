Its like this, Anna, its like that, Anna

Many men wanna piece the thing
She got the eyes that will pierce you skin
Whether smiling or crying she sees the end
And her mind's in the sky but her feet pretend
That she walks on the beach, sparkin a leaf
But the trees don't ease what she feels within
Sees men who see past her
But no matter the wait that's no faith like folks who need pastors
Real women on a set with actors
Who all try to fuck the director the after
Cue music close up back lights, keep the shadow in the front
Pull back cut the tears and laughter

Her man is her fool for not tryin'
Holding up the sky, moment to the time
Lover and a fighter but for now rather try
Being neither till the people in the theater
Realize she's a star

Nobody knows it yet but no, no, no disrespect
Cause you deserve much more than this
And all through it all, fuck them all is your life to live cuz you a star
And nobody knows it yet, but no no disrespect
Cause you deserve much more than this
And all through it all, fuck them all is your life to live

Now whatever way she talks, heads turn away in a shade of dark
In a way, many say she was made for art
If the world is a stage then she played her part
Worst case scenario she find herself, in the wrong film runnin all by herself
And in hell, mademoiselle sells time herself, will she ever bail only time will tell
Real women turn to desperation cause one man's love ain't
Enough to save her
From settlement income, liquidation, she fills the prescription heroin addictions
Seas and reflections, mirrors never mention descendants
With dreams to get free, lover and a fighter but for now rather try
Being neither till the people in the theater
All see she's a star

Nobody knows it yet but no, no, no disrespect
Cause you deserve much more than this
And all through it all, fuck them all is your life to live cuz you a star
And nobody knows it yet, but no no disrespect
Cause you deserve much more than this
And all through it all, fuck them all is your life to live
