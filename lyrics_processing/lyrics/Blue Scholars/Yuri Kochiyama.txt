Oh, yeah!
I got that third world militant, still think it's relevant
Even if them kids copped the shirts and stopped wearin' 'em
Humbled in the presence of the veterans
And not the ones who picked up their guns
But who picked up their brethren and sister and
History in the making I was witnessin'
Listenin', seein' this old Japanese lady with a sticker on her walker, said "Free Mumia" and
This was before the Trustafarians were sayin' it
Taking it for granted that we talk about the 60's and
Never get to talk to anybody who done lived this shit and still exist
Or better yet, shit, she still resist, speaking to a myriad of young, dumb and ignorant kids
I was one of 'em
Stuck around lingering
Said that "It's a privilege to meet you in person" and
She took my hand, said "It's good to meet you too"
And when I'm out of school asked me what I'm gonna do
I had to think about it, but truth is I knew
That it was something for the youth and shit
Truly I'd probably be a teacher if the music didn't make enough
To make me wanna gamble on its sustenance
And that's why I'm writing this, to tell y'all
From a scholar

When I grow up I wanna be just like Yuri Kochiyama
Holla, swear to my kasamas
When I grow up I wanna be just like Yuri Kochiyama
And if she ever hear this its an honor
Cause when I grow up I wanna be just like Yuri Kochiyama
Imma, serve the people proper
When I grow up I wanna be like Yuri Kochiyama
When I grow up I wanna be like Yuri Kochiyama
When I grow up I wanna be like Yuri Kochiyama

I see the picture up in Life magazine
You were sittin' front seat for Malcolm's last speech
Saw the first man with the shotgun (Boom)
Two more came to get the job done
Now who would've thought that it'd be you holding him?
I wonder what you felt when his eyes were going dim
And if he never died, would we know that he exists?
Or would he have been the leader that we always seem to miss?
Now there's no taking back whatever happens in our midst
You remind me that it's more than just a martyr and a myth
You could've said it quits many times ever since and you find
There will always be a reason for the fist
The last one to hold him could've been somebody else
You'd still be remembered for the people that you helped
They said to keep trying but never losing hope
Revolutionaries die, but the revolution don't
And it won't and I put that
On my momma

Cause when I grow up I wanna be just like Yuri Kochiyama
Holla, swear to my kasamas
When I grow up I wanna be just like Yuri Kochiyama
And if she ever hear this it's an honor
Cause when I grow up I wanna be just like Yuri Kochiyama
Imma, serve the people proper
When I grow up I wanna be like Yuri Kochiyama
When I grow up I wanna be like Yuri Kochiyama
