Everybody go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today

Ey, whatchya gonna do today?
Whatchya gonna do today?
Whatchya gonna do today?
Whatcha...

Yo, yo, yo, what you gonna do today?
Make moves while I pay dues
Cruise in the lane
Far left of the lame dudes rest
When I catch my breathe
Feelin' like the last one left
Like what you gonna do today
Same thing that I did for the last
Two to three thousand
Studyin' the math
A lot less time and a lot more class
When they talk that trash
Yup, and it makes us laugh
Should have said "hi" but I ride right past
Doin' all the shit that I dreamt in class
And I might just brag but I'm not that brash
Quick when they can't go flash
I don't pose when I rock old clothes
In a rack with a wide spectrum of cats
And I'm packin' a Mac
In the back of my Honda Civic
Cause I don't got a 'lac

Whatchya gonna do today?
I'mma go back to the cinema fasho
Cast this show with a pass
That I got from a bro from Scarecrow Video
Really though? Oh
Whatchya gonna do today?
I don't know, depends
If I'm home or another timezone
Gotta get your mind blown
If you catchin' our songs
Cause they got more bars and it shows
And there's still no dough
Cats wanna get it for the quid pro quo
Like your bro not grown
No, it's more than reppin' your area code
Wary of various foes
Rock out with my hairy exposed
Where my chariot go?
Waitin' for it to carry me home
And I'm... Yo, I'm in the zone
Ey, whatchya gonna do today?
