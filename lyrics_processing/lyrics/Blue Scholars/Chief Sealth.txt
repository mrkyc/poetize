No screens no things, just pads and keys
No lab no fees, just dranks and weed
No thanks I keed, no what? no need
Humility is not the ability to front
It's when you willingly work for what you want
And you barely could rest until you done
Feel it in your chest
Heart pumps harder when you gotta wake up
Every minute might count
Tired of paying up, we taking the top down
Minds raised up, we feeling it right now
(the whole town sucks!)
You say it so loud that you probably feel the opposite, way deep down
Like anybody still saying pause ya'll clowns
Find Pro Brown when it all falls down
If the motherland calls, who's gonna roll out
A spark for the kid who never thought he could write
But when the pen turned king, now his kingdom is now
And I look back at mine, the things that I find?
I was still the same kid til I listened to the sound
Chorus:
Some bow in the presence of God
We give pounds to each other and taught
Stopped counting the shows that I've rocked
Put em up for the lives of the people we lost
Catch a breath like an immigrant
Sneaking across and where the cash go visas or not we go too (ooh-ooooh!)
It don't stop from the city to the boondocks
Take em to the top, make em all cry

We arrived and we here til we die
We arrived and we here til we die
We arrived and we here til we die
Til we fly...
Ey, ey, ey, ey
Ey comrade, the definition of kasama
Ride with the nineteenth century ninety-niners
Shooting out of post at a post-modernist
Stepping on stage, putting up they lighters
Remind us of the fires in the eyes of a thousand
Armed Guerilla fighters at night watching the township
Making sure nobody violate the boundary
I'll be in the sky
Try to see if you can catch me
Actually, see if you can match me
Now I'm getting hounded by the people who used to walk past me
Casually, only after seeing me perform
Funny how your ass never greeted me before
Seeing how the settlers did Seattle then
Could be the same fate for my fam and my friends
Never saw him, never heard him
Said his people like the tide that'll never flow again
Some bow in the presence of God
We give pounds to each other and taught
Stopped counting the shows that I've rocked
Put em up for the lives of the people we lost
Catch a breath like an immigrant
Sneaking across and where the cash go visas or not we go too (ooh-ooooh!)
It don't stop from the city to the boondocks
Take em to the top, make em all cry
Til we die...
I tell my people out of town that the town ain't changed
Anywhere they say, they saying the same thing
Bang bang, new names but same games
Take aim, maintain or make way,
Came with our clothes on our back and big dreams
Told we will never be shit but keep playing
Told to believe in a God but not seeing
On top of all of that shit we keep praying
Someday, I ain't picking up the phone
Apologies fam, I'm probably in the zone
But me and Sabarillo put it on
It's like Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone
Fist full of dollars, no pocket full of stones
Think twice if you calling this your home
And though I said it on another dang song:
Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat
Some bow in the presence of God
We give pounds to each other and taught
Stopped counting the shows that I've rocked
Put em up for the lives of the people we lost
Catch a breath like an immigrant
Sneaking across and where the cash go visas or not we go too (ooh-ooooh!)
It don't stop from the city to the boondocks
