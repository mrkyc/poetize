Picture me falling, Leonardo's last supper
Now it's overcast thunder just another night slumber
And the lights flash suddenly the cloud's now under me
And if you know me then you know that I ain't one to be
Caught up in mythology, except my name probably
Never read the Odyssey, put it in a song for me
Stimuli economy: highway robbery
I'm seeing stars though: cosmology
You seeing assholes: proctology
So what's your policy if not to be the best that you could possibly be
Without trying to be me
And now you trying to change the world when your home is a mess
Got your priorities mixed huh, you failed the test
It's like passing on a diamond for a dame in a dress
You prematurely champagneing on your way to success, I guess
Everybody gotta roll to the next
And some of us believe and it's bold to suggest
That it was all written in a god bound text
Like we got no power to change the whole script
Me, I think you are more in charge than you think
They want you behind bars and not the ones that you spit
You still rapping a rap I'm so over this shit
You calling this a rap here's a present in fact, I said
Nobody move everybody get hurt
I'm sticking up the world now for everything it's worth
Cause I ain't try to rest if this shit is getting worse
And I'm trying to do more than just put it in a verse
Nobody move everybody get hurt
I'm sticking up the world now for everything it's worth
I ain't try to rest, shit is getting worse
Gotta do more than just put it in a verse
You might also likeIn the future everybody wanna be an entertainer
So tell me who the fuck is gonna be around to pay us
Trying to do us dirty like the shit is not labor
All up in the game and don't deserve to meet your maker
Apparitions of the faces in the crowd, alarms going off and you can hardly hear the sound
A party in the now, everybody's in the clouds
We ain't fucking with the ground, till our body's underground
But they're walking all around, like a king without a crown
The bottoms falling out, it's getting harder not to drown
Economies in doubt, people moving from the town
Man you acting disrespectful like your mother's not around
Now everything I said, I said loud, no doubt
Be the most prolific with the lowest profile
When you listen and you're feeling like time slows down
It's the only way you ever really know it's Pro Brown now
Nobody move everybody get hurt
I'm sticking up the world now for everything it's worth
Cause I ain't try to rest if this shit is getting worse
And I'm trying to do more than just put it in a verse
N-n-nobody move everybody get hurt
I'm sticking up the world now for everything it's worth
I ain't try to rest, shit is getting worse
