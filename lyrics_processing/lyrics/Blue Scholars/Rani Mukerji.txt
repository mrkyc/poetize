Yo
She got her hands in the air
Holding half of the sky
Still got the time to stay fly
Y'all ask why
Not tryna be the last guy
To let another woman pass by
While all the wolves out holla 'Hey ma'
Guess you can really only blame em so far
Don't say nothin' off-color, just smile
Love seeing all kinds of colors when it's warm outside
Don't need to flaunt, don't gotta hide
Brown skin lady, let your darkness shine
Don't ever change cuz you're doing just fine
Pay em no mind when he say you just fine
You get threaded up, get your hair did
Bleach your face hairs, you deserve this
But what you needs is a massage from a therapist
So many love songs but you never heard this

Tumi amake ja-ja-jano na
Chere dao takeo na-na bo-bolo na
Tu-tumi amake ja-jano na chesta korle o jante parbe na
Tumi amake ja-ja-jano na
Chere dao takeo na-na bo-bolo na
Tu-tumi amake ja-jano na chesta korle o jante parbe na

Yo
She got her hands in the air
Holding most of the sky
Still got the time to stay fly
Y'all ask why
Not tryna be the bad guy
To tell another woman what's right
To tell a young sista when or where to take flight
To give and take life, I ain't gotta say it twice
But she gotta bite tongues in a world full of words
Stayin' hella quiet till the girl gonna find the right one
Cuz pops might flip and brothers might trip
When they find out out what be comin' out yo lips
But joke's on them
Cuz I'd be worried far more bout the things that might go in
Out of pocket like lint, when the broke man reach for his wallet
No dollars, no cents
They should pay you much more for the work you give
And I ain't talking about your day job shit

Tumi amake ja-ja-jano na
Chere dao takeo na-na bo-bolo na
Tu-tumi amake ja-jano na chesta korle o jante parbe na
Tumi amake ja-ja-jano na
Chere dao takeo na-na bo-bolo na
Tu-tumi amake ja-jano na chesta korle o jante parbe na

She got her hands in the air
For the whole damn sky
The boys ride off with no bye
Y'all ask why
Not tryna be that guy
To try and break my neck for a contact high
Cuz all men lie and women do too
Cuz see me can't bluff it like the way y'all do
That sly workin, shy girl game too cool
Hit em once, sit back, make a suitor call you
The power you possess, the power you the best
Dry these nuts with the powder you suggest
Attitude justified for all the shit you get
But don't take it out on me, I'm not them
You gettin heated right? You wanna kick back
You said it's girl's night, aight, we get that
So go ahead and go ahead and work that
So many love songs but you never heard that

Tumi amake ja-ja-jano na
Chere dao takeo na-na bo-bolo na
