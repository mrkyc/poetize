With war rising over the horizon
It's hard to start writing
Been fightin; in the belly of the titan
Tying tourniquets tightened around the livin' but dyin'
My pen floods the pages while the children are cryin'
I want to put on an iron shirt, chase the devil out of earth
Spit until my tongue and saliva glands burst
But first I invoke, the spirit of the long gone and coming back, through the song
I am one with that all-seein' being but
It seems as if we're being tricked into believing that which we think we believe in
Even if we disagree on who the best emcee is
We bob to the beat as if we're nodding in agreement
I write to free the dumb, though freedom hasn't come
I let it ring to leave a message on my answering machine
I see a movement has begun
As soon as we become the true truth seekers
Down with this Babylon regime

To think you can die in the blink of an eye
I bid you to try, to test I & I
Been destined to fly, but I'm restin' tonight
And one bright morning I will take flight
But until then, I'll be rockin' on the M
I see the future drippin' out of a pen
And if sleep be the cousin of death
Then every time I blink's one step closer to my last breath

They said talk is cheap, but war is expensive
I speak cuz it's free and these words are my weapons
Don't think for a second, I will not question
US foreign policy, imperial aggression
Inventing war for the quenching of the thirst for the oil
Cause money don't trickle down to workers who toil
You see, blood trickle down from the wounds to the soil
And broken antennas with aluminum foil be
Standing on televisions, transmitting propaganda of millionaire senators
And your so-called commander in chief, B
I'm telling you the man is a thief
In his hand he holds a plan to ban your freedom of speech
To build a pipeline, put Afghanistan on a leash
When it bites back blame the Taliban for the breach
Of security in each and every first world country
Where life more distant if you're thirsty or hungry

To think you can die in the blink of an eye
I bid you to try, to test I & I
Been destined to fly, but I'm restin' tonight
And one bright morning I will take flight
But until then, I'll be rockin' on the M
I see the future drippin' out of a pen
And if sleep be the cousin of death
Then every time I blink's one step closer to my last breath
America romanticized the old war story
Heroes, ammos, guns, blood, guts, and glory
And no wonder the majority wants a war with Iraq
Even if only 15% know where it's at on a map
With our backs against a stockpile of weaponry
Enough to turn the earth into a memory, 'cept there'll be
No one to remember this planet
If it happens god damn it, if I get drafted today
I swear to God, Jah, Allah, and Yahweh
I'll toss the letter away and I'll pull a Cassius Clay, in the military
Minorities comprise the majority
Surprised? are you kidding me? The lies!
Rely on brown bodies to fight for white puppet masters
I cannot fathom how the caged bird drinks
Until he thinks he is free
A critical mass
Between a heavenly future, and a hell of a past, now

To think you can die in the blink of an eye
I bid you to try to test I & I
Been destined to fly, but I'm restin' tonight
And one bright morning I will take flight
But until then, I'll be rockin' on the M
I see the future drippin' out of a pen
And if sleep be the cousin of death
Then every time I blink's one step closer to my last breath
Every time I blink's one step closer to my last
Every time I blink's one step closer to my last
Every time I blink's one step closer to my last breath
