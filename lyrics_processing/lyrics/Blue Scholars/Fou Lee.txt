It goes one, one to the two three
People asking, "Geo, what the hell does OOF! mean?"
If you a true fiend, you'd have knew things, I'm a cool king
Felix, throwing the two-seam
Only came here to tell you two things
Be original, it's unconditional
My unconventional means of marketing things
Is hella ground up in a top-bottom scheme
Rather leave people than the press impressed
I guess it's a good thing got both on the team
If you focused like me, you know what I mean
The door knocks, better hope it's not me
The kid rolls deep with musicians like Ozomatli
Bona fide trees breathe, making petrified knees
These neighbors Black, Latin, all types of Chinese
With a sudden European influx, increased
Been fucked since the real estate bubble burst now
In the realest state witnessing the homicide rates
Like back when the kids watched tapes of Menace and Juice
They need medicine, truth is no single
Man, woman, president can alter the present
By they god damn selves, we move in a swell
One fell motion, them monuments fell
Learned that from Kindu to do it for self, it goes one

One to the two three
Cruise on the hill, getting food at Fou Lee
Gonna take more than a few to fool me
Only get this timing if you study Kool G, ooh wee

It starts simmering down
They start listening now
When I travel then I'm missing the Sound
No particular style, second round
See a trainer in the corner start to pick up the towel
Superhero in the eyes of my child
Guess I gotta live it out until he figures it out
Just an ordinary guy doing extraordinary things
Still got a 9 to 5 but from PM to AM
Seems we were made for the mayhem, literally speaking
This is MC Foods, Alaska to Beacon
Where the power lines reaching and we sleep underneath them
I keep 'em far from the leeches and the drunken collegiate
I was speaking with this cat in the back of the train
He said, "Ten years for this?" Transit is lame
When you consider what we lost for the city to gain
It's more than neighbors and places, it's memories, mane
"Ah, whatever," he says, switch the topic instead
Get to talking 'bout the Hawks and the Sonics and shit
Reminiscing on Dikembe on the floor with the ball
When he balled and we bawled and he's still pissed off
Anybody in the Town into sports, god bless 'em
We heard that all underdogs go to heaven
I tell him, "later," he says, "god willing"
Now I gotta find my way up the hill once again, it goes one
