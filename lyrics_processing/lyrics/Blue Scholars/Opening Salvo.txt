Now, it's the opening salvo
Where poet's scope the people like Mohammad and Malvo
A sample of the battle we wagered against an animal
Made to snuff us out like the wick of a candle
And all the youth dressed in camo, we're ready to handle
And no this war was not scripted, can't change the channel
We canceling all subscriptions, this is the last issue
When the casket closed can't take the cash with you
No post-mortem residuals
We individuals who
Indivisible become the most invincible
But that is not the issue at hand
We demand the simple right to question y'all people
Where the fuck is freedom at?
It's all we ask but instead we get our asses
Assassinated fast
If they catch you talking trash
Then the first shall be last
It's time to prepare
Black clouds, sky falling, put a hand in the air

And my people building monuments to weather the flood
I'm a leave how I came screaming covered in blood
Died once born twice both times we knuckled up
Along side our people we gon' struggle with love
And my people building monuments to weather the flood
I'm a leave how I came screaming covered in blood
Died once born twice both times we knuckled up
Along side our people we gon' struggle with love
So struggle with love, struggle with love, struggle with love

Now this here's for those who choose fights whose fruits might
Never not ripen until after they life
It's not right how they martyr our leaders and target our children
Disrespect the sisters and wonder why we militant
Peace to my third world equivalent
Even if I can't fight beside you
I write what I can
To get our fam in other lands to understand your pain
Cause your beef is mine and we one and the same
And I know about this privilege
But if you're from where I'm from
Then you know a bigger burden comes with it
And that's what I carry when you see me on a hustle
I talking as a walking document of our struggle
Kasamas hold me down and remember that I love you
And Johnny hold your head up if they ever take me from you
And please tell him that I tried, don't cry
Cause no matter where you are, a struggle's near by

And my people building monuments to weather the flood
I'm a leave how I came screaming covered in blood
Died once born twice both times we knuckled up
Along side our people we gon' struggle with love
And my people building monuments to weather the flood
I'm a leave how I came screaming covered in blood
Died once born twice both times we knuckled up
Along side our people we gon' struggle with love
So struggle with love, struggle with love, struggle with love
Right now I want to thank God for being me
My soul won't rest until the colony is free
1896 revolution incomplete
Silence is defeat my solution is to speak
Resurrect a legacy of martyrs I beseech
Time to choose a side it's the might vs. the meek
My big brother Free brought the word from the East
