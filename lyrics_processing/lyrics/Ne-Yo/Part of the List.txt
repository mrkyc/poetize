Style of your hair, shape of your eyes and your nose
The way you stare as if you see right through to my soul
It's your left hand and the way that it's not quite big as your right
The way you stand in the mirror before we go out at night

Our quiet time
Your beautiful mind

They're all part of the list
Things that I miss
Things like your
Funny little laugh or the way you smile
Or the way we kiss
What I notice is this
I come up with
Something new
Every single time
That I sit and reminisce

The way your sweet smell lingers when you leave a room (You leave a room)
Stories you tell as we lay in bed all afternoon (All afternoon)
I dream you now every night, in my mind is where we meet (In my mind is where we meet)
And when I'm awake, staring at pictures of you asleep

Touching your face
Invading your space

They're all part of the list (List)
Things that I miss (Miss)
Things like your
Funny little laugh or the way you smile
Or the way we kiss
What I notice is this (This)
I come up with (With)
Something new
Every single time
That I sit and reminisce

Oh, well, you'll live in my memories forevermore, I swear
And you'll live in my memories forevermore, I swear

They're all part of the list (List)
Things that I miss (Miss)
Things like your
Funny little laugh or the way you smile
Or the way we kiss, hey
What I notice is this (This)
I come up with (With)
