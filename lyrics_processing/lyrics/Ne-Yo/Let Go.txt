Ooh, ooh
Whoa
Listen

I know it's past tense
It's been a minute since
We were a couple
And, walking and holding hands
Kisses and I love you's
Doing what lovers do
Baby
But baby, that was then

'Cause now we don't
Talk no more
You got a new man
And it shouldn't bother me
But girl, it's driving me crazy
And everybody says
Boy, why don't you just leave it alone?
But I don't think I can

I sit up all night
Thinkin' 'bout you
And know it ain't right, baby
But I don't
I don't think that I, don't think
I can let go (Don't think I can let you go)
I sit up all night
Thinkin' 'bout you
And know it ain't right, baby
But I don't
I don't think that I, don't think
I can let go (Don't think I can let you go)
See Ne-Yo LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also like
I'm holdin' on to hope
I know it's foolish though
Thinking that someday she might come back
Wish on it all the time
Knowin' it never may happen
But see I'm not a fool

'Cause no we don't
Talk no more
You gotta a new man
But I'm gonna keep the faith
I've got the patience
That some lack
But everybody says
Boy why don't you just leave it alone
But I don't think I can

I sit up all night
Thinkin' 'bout you
And know it ain't right, baby
But I don't
I don't think that I, don't think
I can let go (Don't think I can let you go)
I sit up all night
Thinkin' 'bout you
And know it ain't right, baby
But I don't
I don't think that I, that I
I can let go
I don't think that I can let you go
I can't let you go
No
I don't think that I can let you go (let go)
And everybody says
And I don't think that I can

I sit up all night
Thinkin' 'bout you
And know it ain't right, baby
But I don't
I don't think that I, don't think
I can let go (I don't think that I can let you go)
I sit up all night
Thinkin' 'bout you
And know it ain't right, baby
But I don't
I don't think that I can let go
And I don't think that I can let you
Said don't think that I can let you
I don't think, I don't think I can let go
