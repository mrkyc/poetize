Closer, closer
Closer, closer (Woo)

Turn the lights off in this place
And she shines just like a star
And I swear I know her face
I just don't know who you are
Turn the music up in here
I still hear her loud and clear
Like she's right there in my ear
Tellin' me that she wants to own me
To control me

Come closer (Come closer)
Come closer

And I just can't pull myself away
Under a spell, I can't break
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
And I just can't bring myself, no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
I just can't stop

I can feel her on my skin
I can taste her on my tongue
She's the sweetest taste of sin
The more I get, the more I want
She wants to own me

Come closer (Come closer)
She says, "Come closer"
Hey

And I just can't pull myself away
Under a spell, I can't break
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
And I just can't bring myself, no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
I just can't stop

Come closer, come closer
Come closer, come closer
Come closer, come closer
Come closer
I just can't stop, no-woah-oh
I just can't stop, no-woah-oh (I just can't stop it, no, no)
I just can't stop, no-woah-oh (Just can't stop)
I just can't stop, no (No, no, no, no, no)

And I just can't pull myself away
Under a spell, I can't break
I just can't stop, I just can't stop (And I just can't stop)
I just can't stop, I just can't stop (And I just can't stop)
And I just can't bring myself no way (Bring myself)
But I don't want to escape (Bring myself)
I just can't stop, I just can't stop (And I just can't stop)
I just can't stop, I just can't stop  (Oh, and I just can't stop)
I just can't stop
And I just can't pull myself away
Under a spell, I can't break
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
I just can't stop, I just can't stop
I just can't stop
