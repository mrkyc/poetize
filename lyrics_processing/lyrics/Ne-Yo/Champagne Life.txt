Welcome to the champagne life
Where trouble is a bubble in a champagne glass
Dreams and reality are one and the same
Don't act like you don't know the name
And we gone do it like this (Oh)

Got an addiction for life and this living
Like everyday's my birthday, know what I'm getting
And reserved for top notch that's where I'm sitting
Me and my friends and found six miss independents (Independents)
And my attitude's so chill and so breezy (breezy)

Sexy baby, don't you dare act like you don't see me
Baby, I know you see me
