Oh, oh, oh, woah
To all the girls I've loved before
I, I
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, woo)

I cannot deny it, I cannot deny it (yeah)
I done broke a few hearts (yeah), done my share of lying
I knew how to keep it quiet, I knew how to hide it
Or if I ever did get caught, I'd just deny it
If my mama knew the thangs I did, she wouldn't like it (yeah)
She taught me way better (yeah), I know I know way better (yeah)
I just didn't care, running round doing whatever
With 3 of they best friends, knew 'em all together

Man, I ain't give a damn, damn
A lot of women had to deal with a boy
That was supposed to be a man, hey
So to the ones I hurt, becoming who I am

I'm sorry, I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (mmm)
For every single tear that fell to get me here
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm so sorry, so sorry (mmm, yeah)
For every heart that I broke to get better
Hey, this is my apology letter, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, woah

Had to put up with the drama of a boy
That was supposed to be a man, man, oh I

I said it was all good, it wasn't good at all
I said I was coming through and never came through (never came through, no)
I said it was me and you and it was quite a few
All of the lies (ayy), all the tears that you've cried (ayy)
If I could go back in time (ayy), then I would undo the crime
But I can't, no, I can't make it right
But at the very least I can go and apologize

Couldn't be who I am today if not for what you did, sorry, I'm sorry
Not for what you went through
So from the bottom of my heart, I'm sorry
Thank you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Sorry, yeah, I'm sorry, yeah
