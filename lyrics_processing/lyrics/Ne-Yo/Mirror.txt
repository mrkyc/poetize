I must be honest with you babe (Just gotta be honest, babe)
I love to watch the faces that you make
(When we make love, ooh wee)
But when I'm behind you holding your hips
And you close your eyes and bite your lips
I can't see you so might I suggest a change?
Now mama, please don't think me strange for what I'm about to say (Please don't think me strange)
If you know anything 'bout me by now
You know I'm a freak, just follow my lead

Baby, I love making love in front of the mirror (In front of the mirror)
So that I can watch you enjoying me (Baby tonight)
Baby tonight, let's try in front of the mirror (In front of the mirror)
Watching ourselves make love
Girl, why don't we?

Little mama, keep your chin up, please watch me do the...nasty
I like it when you make it move fast
Mami if I pull your head back
'Cause I want you to see that we look so good together
I understand that your not ready for me to make my directorial debut
Featuring me but starring you
Baby that's okay with me
Honestly this is the next best thing
