Saying Oooh
Said oooh
Oooh, that lazy love
Oooh, yeah

Oooh, my lobby call was 11:30
I'm officially the opposite of early (early, early)
I gotta go downstairs (downstairs)
Everybody waitin' down there, for me
But I roll over and see yo' curly (hair)
Yo' sexy body oh so nice and curvy (Yea)
Reminiscing on last night
Wake up and let me get it one mo' time, before (before, before)
I gotta go I got responsibilities I gotta take care of (Ooh woah, Ooh woahhh)
That's when you wrap them legs around me, and I fall victim to that lazy love (hey)

You got that I don't wanna, that "I don't wanna go nowhere," that lazy love (hey)
You got that I don't wanna, that "I don't wanna do nothing," you got that lazy love (hey)
You got that I don't wanna, that "I don't wanna do nothing," that lazy love (hey)
You got that I don't wanna, that "I don't wanna do nothing"

Damn baby that was good... I'mma hit the shower
Even though I'm about 2 hours... late
But I can't help it man
If they knew what I knew they would understand (understand)
I'm washin' last night off, time to boss up
Then suddenly on my back I feel a soft touch
She right behind me
Water glistening off her body
Lookin' at me like one more time
But baby I gotta go I got responsibilities I gotta take care of (care of)
That's when you wrap them legs around me, and I fall victim to that lazy love (Woo!)
