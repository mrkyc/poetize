Jet setter, go getter
Nothin' better
Call me Mr. "Been There, Done That"
Top model chick to your everyday hood rat
Less than all but more than a few
But I never met one like you

Been all over the world, done a little bit of everything
Little bit of everywhere, with a little bit of everyone
All the girls I been with, things I've seen, it takes much to impress
But sure nuff your glow, it makes your soul stand out from all the rest baby

I can be in love
But I just don't know
Don't know
Baby one thing is for certain
Whatever you do it's workin'
Other girls don't matter in your presence can't do what you do
There's a million girls around but I don't see no one but you

Girl, you're so one in a million
You are
Baby, you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had
And I'm certain that
There ain't nothin' better
No there ain't nothin' better than this

But that independent thing, I'm with it, all we do is win, baby

But I just don't know
Don't know
