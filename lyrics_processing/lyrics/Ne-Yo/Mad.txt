Woah-oh, woah
Woah-oh, woah

Mmm, she's starin' at me
I'm sittin' wonderin' what she's thinking
Mmm, nobody's talkin'
'Cause talkin' just turns into screamin', oh
And now as I'm yellin' over her, she yellin' over me
All that that means is neither of us are listening
And what's even worse, that we don't
Even remember why we're fighting

So both of us are mad for nothing (Fighting for)
Nothing (Crying for)
Nothing (Woah, oh-oh)
But we won't let it go for nothing (Come back for)
Nothing, it should be nothing
To a love like what we got

Oh, baby I know sometimes it's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now?
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain (Can't sleep through the pain)
Girl, I don't wanna go to bed (Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed (Mad at me)
No, I don't wanna go to bed (Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed (Mad at me)
Oh, no, no, no
See Ne-Yo LiveGet tickets as low as $55You might also like
Mmm, and it gets me upset
Girl, when you're constantly accusing, oh, hey
(Asking questions like you already know)
Why fight in this war, baby when both of us are losing? Oh, woah
(This ain't the way that love is supposed to go)
(What happened to workin' it out?)
We fall into this place where you ain't backin' down
And I ain't backin' down
So what the hell do we do now?

It's all for nothing (Fighting for)
Nothing (Crying for)
Nothing (Woah, oh-oh)
We won't let it go for nothing (No, not for)
Nothing, it should be nothing
To a love like what we got

Oh, baby I know sometimes it's gonna rain (Hey, it's gonna rain, mmh)
But baby, can we make up now? (Oh, oh-oh)
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain (Uh, can't sleep through the pain)
Girl, I don't wanna go to bed (Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed (Mad at me)
No, I don't wanna go to bed (Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed (Mad at me)
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, baby, this love ain't gon' be perfect, oh no (Perfect, perfect, oh)
And just how good it's gonna be
We can fuss and we can fight
As long as everything's alright between us
Before we go to sleep
Baby, we're gonna be happy
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah
Oh, woah

Baby, I know sometimes it's gonna rain (Soon it's gonna rain)
But baby, can we make up now? (Can we make up now?)
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain (Can't sleep through the pain)
Girl, I don't wanna go to bed (Mad at you) (Oh)
And I don't want you to go to bed (Mad at me) (Oh)
No, I don't wanna go to bed (Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed (Mad at me)
