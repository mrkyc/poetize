But then you poke around for a better plan
Its not an easy street give you, give you all tonight
I'm such a mess right now, such a mess right now
You better show me how I'm not the simple kind
Its not an easy street give you give you all alright
You go OH
S-s-say it come and say it out loud
So they all can hear

I'm the one, I'm the one for you
Sh-sh-shake it while your at it now, like you mean it now
Gimme once gimme twice alright
I said to live this life, said to live this life
It takes a hell lot time make your peace tonight
Its not an easy street I shouldn't even bother now
But wanting less in life, like the strokes in town
You better sip through all your fancy wine
And come alive once more
