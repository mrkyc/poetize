I see the world has gone mad
I see them talk the talk, walk the walk, but nothing stands out
I see the world has gone mad
I think I'll do you like I used to do, do it all night

I see the world has gone mad
I say we do it like we used to do, fuck the charade
Where is my band? Where are my friends?
They turn to DJs and just hit it, hit it big time instead

I set the world on fire
The world on fire

I set the world on fire, won't let you go
Now all the pieces come together and I let it all go
I set the world on fire, won't let you go
I come and pick you up and clean you like the world from above

I see the world has gone mad
I say we do it like we used to do, do it all night
Where's every plan? What's their next move?
I say just fuck them let them know that they ain't doing no good

Get the job, get the job, get the job done
Do it like we used to do it, do it all night
Get the job, get the job, get the job done
They do it like they used to do, they do it all wrong

I set the world on fire, won't let you go
Now all the pieces come together and I let it all go
I set the world on fire, won't let you go
I come and pick you up and clean you like the world from above
I set the world on fire, the world on fire, the world on fire
Now all the pieces come together and I let it all go

Get the job, get the job, get the job done
Do it like we used to do it, do it all night
Get the job, get the job, get the job done
They do it like they used to do, they do it all wrong

I set the world on fire, won't let you go
Now all the pieces come together and I let it all go
I set the world on fire, won't let you go
I come and pick you up and clean you like the world from above
I set the world on fire, the world on fire, the world on fire
