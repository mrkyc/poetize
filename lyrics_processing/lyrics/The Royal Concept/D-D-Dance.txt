In a room with both of your rivals
You would always turn it around
Once you go, once you get started
Always had that look in your eyes
You would always reach without trying
I didn't spend this time to fall out
Watch me take my chances on the weekends
You could always read me by heart

I know you're still green but I'll start you a scene that you can write about
When you come around (come around)
I know you're still green, girl
I'll start you a scene, girl

Always on the go, keep your head up now
Na Na Na (Not quite that high!)
D-d-dance dance dance till you get it right
Always on the go, keep your head up now

As you would window-shop just to heal up
You would always question my kind
Watch you go, watch how you run off
Watch you go, watch you get back
You might also like
I know you're still green, but I'll let you go queen on me twenty-five
Enough tonight (enough tonight)
I know you're still green, girl
I'll let you go queen, girl

Always on the go, keep your head up now
Na Na Na (Not quite that high!)
D-d-dance dance dance till you get it right
Always on the go, keep your head up now

Always on the go, keep your head up now
D-d-dance dance dance till you get it right
D-d-dance dance dance till you get it right
D-d-dance dance dance till you get it right
D-d-dance dance dance till you get it right
D-d-dance dance
D-d-dance dance
D-d-dance dance dance til' you get it right
D-d-dance dance
D-d-dance dance
D-d-dance, d-d-dance, d-d-dance-dance-dance-dance-dance

Always on the go, keep your head up now
Na Na Na (Not quite that high!)
D-d-dance dance dance till you get it right
Always on the go, keep your head up now
I said not
Always on the go, keep your head up now
Na Na Na (Not quite that high!)
D-d-dance dance dance till you get it right
