Oh my baby and I, we got diamond halos up in the sky
We got, right kind, too blind
And set this house on fire
Oh my baby and I, we got diamond halos up in the sky
We got, big smiles, love flowing
On fire and we're glowing

Call us liars
Our filthy desires
Gonna keep us higher than love
And they can call us wrong
But that's where we belong
Gonna keep us higher than love

I know you wanna

I know you wanna go higher
I know you wanna
I know you wanna
I know you wanna go higher
I know you wanna
I know you wanna
I know you wanna go higher
Just get it on
Yeah we belong

Oh my baby and me, we're like third rate lovers of the first degree
We're like, big wheels, tough shooters
Free love without computers
Oh my baby and me, we're like third rate lovers of the first degree
We got, right kind, too blind
Shake them hips like tambourines

Call us liars
Our filthy desires
Gonna keep us higher than love
And they can call us wrong
But that's where we belong
Gonna keep us higher than love

I know you wanna

I know you wanna go higher
