'Cause I can't take another war
I'm naked do just what you please with me
I hear the neighbor's screams
These walls can't handle queens
And you go, on and on, but we're heading to
And you talk, only dirty lines are coming through
But why stop, when it's all we know and all we do just
Just leave me knocked out on your floor
And all you say is
Damn, damn, damn, my feet just wanna touch new ground
(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Don't, don't, don't go wasting time on helpless minds
(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Just leave my heart here on the ground
Oh no, we're breaking where we're bound
Your body twisted in the seets, with me
It's running through my head
The stupid words I said
And you talk, only dirty lines are coming through
But why stop, when it's all we know and all we do just
Just leave me knocked out on your floor

Damn, damn, damn, my feet just wanna touch new ground
(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
Don't, don't, don't go wasting time on helpless minds
(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
'Cause the light go out, we just wanna have more
And we live the life we're gonna die for
And all you say is
Damn, damn, damn, my feet just wanna touch new ground
Get on the phone I felt left out
And I don't wanna feel the rush
Get on the phone I felt left out
And I don't wanna feel the rush
And all you say is
Damn, damn, damn, my feet just wanna touch new ground
(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
Don't, don't, don't go wasting time on helpless minds
(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
And all you say is
Damn, damn, damn, my feet just wanna touch new ground
(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
Don't, don't, don't go wasting time on helpless minds
(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
'Cause the light go out, we just wanna have more
And we live the life we're gonna die for
And all you say is
Damn, damn, damn, my feet just wanna touch new ground
I'm just as sad to see you go
