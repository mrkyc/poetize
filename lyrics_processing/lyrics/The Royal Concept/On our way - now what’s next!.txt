I'll believe when the storm is through
I believe I heard them say
David won't you stop writing songs
I never wanna shake their hands and stay
I never wanna shake their hands and stay
Oh no let's go
We are young, we are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place, place, place
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way somehow
Hold me close, close, close
We're losing time, time, time
We're losing time, time, time
I'm falling to the ground
I'll believe when the sky is burning
I'll believe when I see the view
I believe that I heard them say
David won't you stop dreaming now
And everybody clap your hands and shout
And everybody clap your hands and shout
We are young, we are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place, place, place
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way somehow
Hold me close, close, close
We're losing time, time, time
We're losing time, time, time
I'm falling to the ground
We are young, we are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place, place, place
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way, way, way
Hold me close
We're losing time
Hold me close
We're falling to the ground
Taxi driver sun is rising
Damn the sirens, keep on driving
Flashing light, oh what a night
I miss her bed, I lost my head
And it's sunning, we're still running
For her rooftop, our last stop
Barefoot, naked, don't you let me go
To your place, place, place
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way somehow
Hold me close, close, close
We're losing time, time, time
We're losing time, time, time
I'm falling to the ground
We are young, we are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place, place, place
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way
La la la la la
(This Night Will Never End)
Hold me close, we're losing time
