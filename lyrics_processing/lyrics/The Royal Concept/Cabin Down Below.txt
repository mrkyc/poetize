I'm stuck with Albert, Fab and Bev, I'm stroking out
I want it all, I'll play my part
I'll find another but it's her I'll dream about
I need it now, I wanna fall
I wanna scream and shout and raise another war
Pick up the phone, Rip me apart
I'm like a fire burning out
Caught up in the glow at a cabin down below
And I'm falling and I'm falling and I'm falling
Like a rolling stone, just take me home
Close enough to touch but I want it all too much
And I'm falling and I'm falling and I'm falling
Like I'm all alone, just take me home
Right back in love, we're on repeat
I feel the beating of the beating of the beat
Look at us go, we're speeding up
I'm throwing pennies down a wishing well tonight
I want it all, I need it now
We're stuck at yelling at each other day and night
Keep walking down this dead end street
What you doing, doing to me
You might also likeThen I catch her eye and she's waving me goodbye
And I'm falling and I'm falling and I'm falling
Like a rolling stone, just take me home
Caught up in your lies sell me any lullabies
And I'm falling and I'm falling and I'm falling
Like I'm all alone, just take me home

As long as we're together this fight will last forever
I'm running and I'm running and I'm running
And it's all for you, it's all for you
I could never leave her, I will always be there
I'm falling and I'm falling and I'm falling
Like a rolling stone, just take me home
(Just take me home)
Caught up in the glow at a cabin down below
And I'm falling and I'm falling and I'm falling
Like a rolling stone, just take me home
Close enough to touch but I want it all too much
And I'm falling and I'm falling and I'm falling
Like I'm all alone, just take me home
Just take me home
And I'm falling
