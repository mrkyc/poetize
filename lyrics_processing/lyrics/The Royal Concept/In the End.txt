I get all terrified whenever
Our worlds collide
You've never been around
So how come you're all dressed up now?
And you look good, you really do
But now is not the time
To mess about you know
I would have but my hands are tied

And in the end you're on your own
I couldn't stand there all alone
Just how independent have you grown
And all those tears will be long gone
But in the end you're on your own
I just can't wait for this no more
I couldn't stand there all alone

I know you wouldn't have the guts
To say my name out loud
Ten thousand people wouldn't care
To say it right out loud
And you get terrified and think
About the big black sky
But all the stars, they all make sense
Compared to you and me
You might also like
And in the end you're on your own
I couldn't stand there all alone
Just how independent have you grown
And all those tears will be long gone
But in the end you're on your own
I just can't wait for this no more
I couldn't stand there all alone

'Cause you're the only one I get
I'm the one you tried to hide
You're the only girl inside
I'm the only one you found
You're the only one this fierce
I'm the one that stayed somehow
We're the only ones tonight
We're just here for one more night
We can stay the way we are
You can be with whom you want
You can hold onto your world
You can dance the night away
I can teach you how to fall
I can teach you how to fly
Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly
La la, oh, la la, oh
La la, oh, la la, oh
La la, oh, la la, oh
