Wait, I meant to keep you
But I had to live out the dream
Wait, I meant to hide you
Safe away from the scene
You, you had me thinking
These times I wish they would last
You, you had me guessing
Guessing all along

And who we're kidding this time? I think they got it by now
Come be my role model now
I need a taste for a while then I'll let you go
Is there a place you would rather be?
Show me your true face then hide from me
But I always end up kissing you then missing you even more and more
I always mess it up, I never got it right not even one
You tell me I'm a liar that I can't decide which way to go
But in the end you're like me
And in the end you're like me

Wait, I keep the lights on
Just in case someone calls
You, I need to have you
By my side tonight
You might also like
And who we're kidding this time?
I think they've got it by now
Come be my role model now
I need a taste for a while then I'll let you go
Is there a place you would rather be?
Show me your true face then hide from me
But I always end up kissing you then missing you even more and more
I always mess it up, I never got it right not even once
You tell me I'm a liar that I can't decide which way to go
But in the end you're like me
And in the end you're like me

I know we're kidding this time
I think I got it by now
Come be my role model now
I need a taste for a while then you go
Is there a place you would rather be?
Show me your true face then hide from me
But I always end up kissing you then missing you even more and more
I always mess it up, I never got it right not even once
You tell me I'm a liar that I can't decide which way to go
But in the end you're like me
And in the end you're like me
And in the end
And in the end
And in the end, end, end
You're like me
Make way for the gold rush, gold rush, gold rush
Make way for the gold rush
Make way for the gold rush, gold rush, gold rush
Make way for the gold rush
Make way for the gold rush
