We've been at it as long as I've known you
This might be all the love I need now
Giving me the sweet talk
Weren't you the one that just get out?
Good luck finding guys that can keep up
Every time you freak out

I can't say the drama's gone, it's just begun
There's certain things you don't tell girls
I've said too much

But please don't tell me I'm the one they're all the one
I feel left out, I'm hanging up
I'm losing you, got things to do that don't include you fool
No, no, nowhere to go
She's so lonely, naked and dumb
With her strip pole
Saving for the ticket
Now I'm in the back room
Naked and dumb
Just stupid to think that she's done
She's just started, reaches for a big kiss now
You might also like
I can't say the drama's gone, it's just begun
There's certain things you don't tell girls
I've said too much

But please don't tell me you're the one
They're all the one, I'm stroking out, you're losing me
I'm losing you, the maddest girl I knew
No, no, want you to know that you're
Far, far, far from the one, you're deluded
High up in your sky, take me down
How come always psycho?
Naked and dumb
She's just stupid to think that I'd come
And we're flying high up in her sky
I know that's where I'll always be closer
Closer to you
But there's so much I'd rather do
You're deluded
High up in your sky, take me down
Now she's at my doorstep, naked and dumb
She's just stupid to think that I'd come
And we're flying high up in her sky
I know that's where they'll find me again
I can't say the drama's gone, it's just begun
There's certain things you don't tell girls
