On a secret
I thought you'd like to know, know
I always misbehave
'Cept on weekends
Then I sort you out, out
Wait
I'm bleeding
From all the knives you've thrown, thrown
To kill is such a thrill, you say
Crash your silly dreams
Crash your silly dreams
Smash 'em like a bug now
And I'm still bleeding from you're loaded guns
Alright!
I'm a busy, busy man
With your heart in my hand
I got your number, I will dial
'Til you sort yourself out
You say I always choose
Always choose
Myself over you
I'm a busy, busy man
With your heart in my hand
You keep me waiting for my change
With my heart in your hand
And now my fire's out
Fire's out!
Fire's out!
And now you say that we're alright
Hey
I'm burnin'
From all your loaded guns, guns
I wish you'd give it up
Like I did
We're better of that way, way
It's funny how it goes these days
Crash your silly dreams
Crash your silly dreams
Smash 'em like a bug now
And I'm still bleeding from your loaded guns
Alright!
I'm a busy, busy man
With your heart in my hand
I got your number, I will dial
'Til you sort yourself out
You say I always choose
Always choose
Myself over you
I'm a busy, busy man
With your heart in my hand
You keep me waiting for my change
With my heart in your hand
And now my fire's out
Fire's out!
Fire's out!
I g-g-g-got your heart in my hand
I got your number I will dial
'Til you sort yourself out
You say I always choose
Always choose
Myself over you
I'm a busy, busy man
With your heart in my hand
You keep me waiting for my change
With my heart in your hand
And now my fire's out
Fire's out!
Fire's out!
I'm so
Busy, busy, busy, busy
Busy, busy, busy, busy
Busy, you're so busy, wizzy, busy, busy
And now my fire's out
Fire's out!
Fire's out!
