I saw Jesus on the cross on a hill called Calvary
"Do you hate mankind for what they done to you?"
He said, "Talk of love not hate, things to do, it's getting late
I've so little time and I'm only passin' through."

Passin' through, passin' through
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue
Glad that I ran into you
Tell the people that you saw me passin' through
(Come a little closer, friend)

I saw Adam leave the garden with an apple in his hand
I said "Now you're out, what are you gonna do?"
"Plant some crops and pray for rain, maybe raise a little Cain
I'm an orphan now, and I'm only passin' through, so are you"

Passin' through, passin' through
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue
Glad that I ran into you
Tell the people that you saw me passin' through

I was with Washington at Valley Forge, shivering in the snow
I said, "How come the men here suffer like they do?"
"Men will suffer, men will fight, even die for what is right
Even though they know they're only passin' through"
You might also like
Passin' through, passin' through
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue
Glad that I ran into you
Tell the people that you saw me passin' through

I was at Franklin Roosevelt's side on the night before he died
He said, "One world must come out of world war two" (ah, the fool)
"Yankee, Russian, white or tan," he said, "a man is still a man
We're all on one road, and we're only passin' through"

Passin' through, passin' through
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue
Glad that I ran into you
Tell the people that you saw me passin' through
Let's do it one more time

Passin' through, passin' through
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue
Glad that I ran into you
