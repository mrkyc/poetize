The one I'm using now it's covered up with fear and filth and cowardice and shame"

Come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me

He said, "I locked you in this body, I meant it as a kind of trial
You can use it for a weapon or to make some woman smile"

Yeah and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me

I want a face that's fair this time, I want a spirit that is calm"

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me

I went down to the desert to help my brothers fight
I know that they weren't wrong, I know that they weren't right
But bones must stand up straight and walk and blood must move around
