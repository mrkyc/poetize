Rollin slow on molten 30's gold over my pearlies
See a lady I get flirty this is how we do it in the dirty

Now what you gon go do after church
Hit the mall snatch a hat grab a shirt
Wash the 'Lac wax the 'Vert clean the truck
We finna ball stash the strap and pass the purp
Me and my dogs ridin old school whippin in the back street
Lookin for the chickens on the strip like Zaxby's
Now them hoes is out boy believe it
When they be cute I have to stop em
Love myself some Georgia Peaches and daisy dukes wit apple bottoms
Police tell us leave we wanna chill
Free plate took the cooked meat on the girll
Shawty gon choose when she see me lean
Make the draws drop fast like my TV screens
So high think I might overdose
Behind tint gettin bent tint smokin dro

Rollin slow on molten 30's gold over my pearlies

I'm at the park tryna holla at every girl
The paint on the Chevy drippin like a jheri curl
We covered in candy on mustard and mayonnaise
We ride 30 spokes while the others on fan blades
We firin up the dro bumpin Frankie and Maze
Top down sittin low chillin under the shade
Watchin cars cruisin I should walk wit jewelry
The broads they choosin baby how you doin
Some barbequin playin cards they losin
Gamblers get stupid then they start to shootin
Patron in the trunk wit the coolers of brewskis
We dogs on the hunt for thick hips and the booty
Fresh dressed like a million bucks
You see me I keep cologne Red Monkey jeans cuffs
Then I step out the car then I thought "oh no"
I got back in I forgot my ones on
