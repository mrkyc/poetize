She say she don't want no more
My shorty done cut me loose and left me in the wind
Got a new man wit a Ph.D. and cheese, but he pees in Depends
He's sixty, she's in her twenties
She said I be hurtin' her, overworkin' her
And when I hit from back it feels like I'm burpin' her
She said I'm wrong for her, too long for her
But she never complained when I
Brought the X home for her
But now she dropped me like the pin at the end of a Sprint commercial
I try to hit it, she be like no, like Laura Winslow, and I'm convinced I'm Urkel
And what if I did misuse and abuse your clit, I'll apologize
Cause I ain't know ruler sticks, would bruise the clit
I saw it on tape tried to do the shit
Now she say she want somebody simple
She say she want somebody gentle she said, when I got head
I dug in her cheek, now she got a dimple
I, I, I mean she cute with it though, I, I couldn't help it
The way she swallowed my pelvis
Had me seeing shit, had a nigga reaching for Elvis
And I come on her head, that some I'm a miss
That girl gave my dick more hickeys than a damn redneck locksmith

I woke up this morning stretching
Yawning with a hard on, horny, ready to bone
Then I reached on my right and realized my woman's gone
I got up to bring her to bed to hit her some more
But I found this envelope sitting on the pillow
I opened it, unfolded it, it said, "Dear Smoke
Hey, it's me your Little Debbie Cake and I feel it's best we separate
At least until I'm in better shape
Cause I'm doing my best to shut up and take
The way you ramming inches in me
Slam me in different positions
Grasp and grip my hips and titties
Put one leg up drag and flip me
Fucking me up, down, back, to front
(How you squeezing and smacking my butt)
From right to left, left to right
(And skeeting across my breast and thighs)
Fucking me early Monday, again on Tuesday
All day Wednesday then come Thursday
Twice on Friday and Saturday and after church on Sunday
Hurting my stomach, beating the cock
But trip, when I ask you to eat the twat, so we need to stop
Cause lately I been bleeding a lot, so I'm leaving you, doc
To find someone that's fair and square
And not so hairy there, who fucks me there with care
Cause you put too much wear and tear on my derriere"
