Ah..ah two times
Comin up, and I feel you and I done it up together
Crushed a qt time
And tha fun is up
Sun down, and the sun is up
Late at night night and day, you was up under me
Or I was up under ya (Punda ya)
When I'm on the cut I can come to ya
And when I bust, you suck it up like a pundaba
You kept a bundle a under ya
Gucci or a Coach bag
Whatever ya got ya gave Smoke had
Thats why its so sad...when ya say (ta take meee)
And I gotta disappoint cha
Its not I don't want cha
Its that I got thangs to do peeps to see
Expensive champagnes to drank, trees to chief
And drop mo hits than Tina T receive from Ike
And mo classics than Rees
And Chevy Caprice
So please be sweet
And believe in me
And understand ya can't be with me
But ya ain't trying ta hear it cuz ya still screaming to me

Fore I die
