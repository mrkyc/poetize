Brand new 24s on the Chevrolet

How do you like my wheels (my wheels)
Check out my wheels (wheels)
HEY!
(Shawn Jay)
Now everybody smoke but I be higher than the birds go
My donk got big feet I'm drivin on the dirt flo'
Naw this ain't ya average old school
My paint (change faster) than the (cast of Road Rules)
My tires is skinny the rims wide and swole
My sound system like ya (life) I got the (highs and lows)
Ya hear me comin I'll give you time to hide ya hoes
Be five minutes before ya see me cause I'm drivin slow
Fresher than potpourri be betcha I'm smokin freely
Leather with oak and TVs matchin my spokes and peet me (??)
Slow motion like a blimp I glide
And I didn't need (Xzibit) to "Pimp My Ride"

My Chevy Caprice's windows darker than my complexion is
Tinted like you ridin in the car with the President
And it's sittin way up in the air people wave say hey and stare
Cause my Chevy wheels (bigger than the ferris at the fair)
They shinin brighter than the sun I wash 'em from Monday to Sunday
I (wax on and wax off) like I'm (Daniel-san)
My roof's missin on my car it's (topless) like a (titty bar)
I thought I saw my ceiling on the back of a milk carton
24 inch wires spin Pirellis on my tire's wheel
Enough fuel in my Chevy to start a campfire wit
The doors open by remote that's why you see no handles
(beep beep) watch the doors go up like a Lambo

I'm addicted to choppin
I... tried to stop
I-I-I feel the fiends
Cause see I love (Chevys) the way they (like a rock)
I heard that Kanye West sayin Jesus Walks
But if He see what I ride He'll have a reason to drive
(Stevie Wonder) flow (can't see me) but you feelin it
FBI forever Chevy tell 'em who they dealin wit
(Chevy P aka Smoke)
We the young do' slammers wear the crown around town
As the wheels on my donk go round and round
My speakers (hit) like (Sammy Sosa) got that DJ Magic Mike (BASS)
Backseat.. acne (bumpin) like (Craig Mack's face)
Pissin 'em off me cause he sloppy in his jaloppy
Until I can sit my Chevrolet on 26s I'll be
Blowin dro on 24s
That's how all my Field Boys roll
