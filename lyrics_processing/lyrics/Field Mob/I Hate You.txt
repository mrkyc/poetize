I would like to welcome everybody today
First, before I get into my speech...because I do have a speech
The sounds you are listening to are provided by Kid Joe
Ah yea...I'm Shawn Jay and I want to make a special announcement
For all the baby mamas
I see you bitch *laughing* You too bitch
Baby, baby, baby you know I love you
Baby, baby, baby you know I love you
SHUT UP
I hate you so much right now {*8X*}

Lemme calm down
I think I need to smoke one
Ya messin with my nerves
I gotta get away .... from you
Battle of sexes, more beef then summer jam
Both blamin each other, pointin fingers like Uncle Sam
I be chillin man ... she just flip on some ol' shit
Woman hold a grudges like piss on a road trip
She be answerin my phone like she stay in my crib
Worryin' about who's callin like she payin my bills
Complain complainen every day and I feel
You gon' have to be happy with callin' me baby daddy
No mo' ridin and kickin' it... blowin dro in the caddie
You had me...no more *YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU BABY*
What ? bitch I ain't ya *BABY* bitch I ain't ya *BABY*
*YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU*

Lemme calm down
I think I need to smoke one
Ya messin with my nerves
I gotta get away .... from you
Kinda remind me of a dream
I never had but wish'd I would've
Pathetic like a diabetic... see, I miss her suger
But not the temper tantrums
One minute you love me, the next you mad hollin' fuck me
U-G-L-Y no alibi yo attitude is ugly
Cut up all my clothes
This chick is kinda coo coo
Nah I ain't hit her but I shook her like a Yoo-hoo
I...I caught myself I turned to her
Baby I dont wanna Ike Turner ya
But she want me to catch a charge
Lied to my...she shoved me
Lied to her friend ... he just hit me cause he love me
I hate you so much right now {*8X*}
Lemme calm down
