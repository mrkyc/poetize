I represent the south, and that's the way i'm a keep it
If u got game then peep it, it's the southern way
I wouldn't have it no other way, so mutha fuck what the others say
Love it or leave
Yes it's hard but it's fair, gotta hustle to get it
Keep grindin and grindin, and soon u will get it, the struggle is in me, that's
How i had to live, that's why i'm actin like a nigga that ain't never had shit
Mashin the flo master to the floor, petal to the metal hear the dual pipes
Roar, wanna be a balla shot caller, twenty inch blades
Skinny benny tryin to get paid
Chorus
We them country ass niggas from the bottom of the map, ridin heavy big bodies
And vogues
We drink cheap liquor smoke sticky sweet swishers and boy we love fucking them
Hoes(repeat)
Damn real i'm a country ass nigga, shawn show no shame
Bare-foot on your block selling rock cocaine
Georgia boy from the south spit when i talk
Smack when i eat, from the field pimp when i walk
Whoa, lil daddy he ain't even not ready
Field mob come ridin a stretch box chevy
Follow me now, i'm a take you where the good dope at call it butter
Where the hood folks at, in the gutter
Stay low, keep movin nah you can't stop
Them boys infrared dot your du-rag and tanktop
That guerilla coke grown
Suburban word with more grams than a old folks home
Now this the way i slang dick every which a way
Best get your bitch and pray she don't wanna get with J
But if i do mack your bitch
You just shit outta luck like leprechaun laxative
Chorus
I get sick if i ain't home in the south u can hear it in my voice
Watch i get on the track and ride like a rolls royce
