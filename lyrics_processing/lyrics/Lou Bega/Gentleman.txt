I am the type of guy
That picks you up in a Benz
I am the type of man that'll always represents
I am the type of freak
That calls you seven days a week
You don't believe it?
You gotta understand!
You wouldn't call me gentleman
If you only knew my plan
You wouldn't take the chance to dance with dynamite
Are you ready to explore with me tonight?
I'm a gentleman!
I send you flowers
What's yours is ours
I wanna tell ya that I care
You think I'm gentle
So sentimental
You don't believe it, but you gotta understand
You wouldn't call me gentleman
If you only knew my plan
You wouldn't take the chance to dance with dynamite
Are you ready to explore with me tonight?

Yes, I am!
I'm your man
Yes, I am!
I send you e-mails
With nasty details
I wanna tell ya that I care
You think I'm gentle
So sentimental
You don't believe it, but you've gotta understand
I'm a gentleman!
You wouldn't call me gentleman
If you only knew my plan
You wouldn't take the chance to dance with dynamite
Are you ready to explore with me tonight?
Ladies, fasten your seatbelts
Switch on your electronic devices
And pump up the volume
Let me know if we could flow like a river
It's my quest baby
To warm you up when you shiver
I'm extra gentle
Super duper sentimental
I'm the man that understands
You wouldn't, you wouldn't 
You wouldn't call me gentleman
If you only knew my plan
You wouldn't take the chance to dance with dynamite
Are you ready to explore with me tonight?
I'm your man
Yes, I am!
I'm your man
Yes, I am!
Gentleman!
You wouldn't , you wouldn't
You wouldn't call me gentleman
If you only knew my plan
You wouldn't take the chance to dance with dynamite
Are you ready to explore with me tonight?
You need a gentleman
