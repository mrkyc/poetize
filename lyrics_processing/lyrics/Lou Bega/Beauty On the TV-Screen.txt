She is the appetite, my appetite for love
And I know that she is comin', that she is comin' from above
Everytime I see her, I just can't get enough
She is cute, she is pretty, and sometimes she is tough

She's my beauty
She's my beauty on the TV-screen
Yeah, she is! And when you see her
You would know what I really mean, you would know what I mean
She's my beauty
Beauty (Yeah, she is!)
She's my beauty
Beauty (Yeah, yeah)


Yes, she got legs that reach the skies
And she has eyes that are open wide
So please, could you jump out that damn TV
And put those little arms all around me?
There is nothin', yeah, there's nothin' like that little butt
Planned out, designed, and coproduced by God
Yeah, when I see yo,u I just can't get enough
'Cause she's cute, and pretty, and sometimes she is tough

She will never disappoint me
She will never make me cry
She will never ever play me
But her lovin' lets me die
She will never disappoint me
She will never make me cry
She will never ever play me
But her lovin' lets me die
