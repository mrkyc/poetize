Want you gimme that beat back, ooh
Want you gimme that beat, ooh
Want you gimme that beat back, ooh

Travel little faster, everybody turn up
Aim a little higher, rubber on the road to my destination
Sing a little louder, let it all out
Set it all in motion, rubber on a road to the next dimension

Let's get the fiesta started
Don't be so broken hearted
Come on, let's stay together
We're on this road forever
Let's get the fiesta started
Don't be so broken hearted
Well, it's a new beginning
Get up, get up, go singing

Want you gimme that beat back, ooh
Want you gimme that beat, ooh
Want you gimme that beat back, ooh
Want you gimme that beat
