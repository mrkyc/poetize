She likes bars, she likes diamonds too
She likes stars if they rendezvous
She likes champagne to maintain her style
She likes a man only for a while
She likes access to your bank account
She likes dollars, she likes British pounds
She likes money only in high amounts
Baby is cool she knows what counts

She likes to pay with credit cards, ride expensive cars
Stays in the president suite
And every day she's looking for a man who gives her more
To satisfy her needs

She's soulshaker, troublemaker
She is a heartbreaker
Undertaker, moneymaker
She is a lovefaker
Soulshaker, troublemaker
She is a heartbreaker
Undertaker, moneymaker
She is a lovefaker

Tricky, tricky
But she is pretty, pretty
She is tricky, tricky
But she is pretty, pretty, so damn pretty

I like holidays when there is nothing to do
I like fun for free and an ice cold brew
I like to watch football on TV
I like to sleep and wake up around three
I like to hang out with my boys, making lots of noise
Dancing in a club, there is no choice
She will never understand that I can't be her man
I am what I am, so damn!

She likes to pay with credit cards, ride expensive cars
Stays in the president suite
And every day she is looking for a man who gives her more
To satisfy her needs

Tricky, tricky (Tricky, tricky)
But she is pretty, pretty (Pretty, pretty)
