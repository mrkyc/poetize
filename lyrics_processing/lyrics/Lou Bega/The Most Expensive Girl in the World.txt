Jimmy was a fly guy with a big Mercedes
He thought he could get all type of ladies
He made a lot of money cause he's a money maker
And if he looks for style, he rides jet ski in Jamaica
He met this beautiful girl, standing at a bar
And Jimmy could swear she looks like a star

He got the the most expensive girl in the world
The most expensive girl
He got the the most expensive girl in the world
The most expensive girl, she looks like a star
He got the the most expensive girl in the world
The most expensive girl, she looks like a star
He got the the most expensive girl in the world
The most expensive girl


But Jimmy didn't listen, yes, he didn't
His friends warned him, he thought they must be kiddin'
Jimmy felt in love like he never did before
For any kiss he gets, she takes him to the store
And every time, she buys more than Jimmy can carry
So she employed a butler and his name was Larry

The most expensive girl, she looks like a star
He got the the most expensive girl in the world
The most expensive girl, she looks like a star
He got the the most expensive girl in the world

Jimmy's out of money, he spent all on his honey
He's searchin' for a credit, but his friends regret it
He's workin' at three jobs, but that is not enough
To pay all her needs, to pay all her stuff
I saw her later on a luxury ferry
And next to her stood a man and his name was Larry
Oh man, he got played

He got the the most expensive girl in the world
The most expensive girl
He got the the most expensive girl in the world
