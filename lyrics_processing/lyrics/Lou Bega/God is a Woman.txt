Everytime you put a little spell on my sky
I realize that I need you to the day that i die
I need you 'til the day I die
I know your fingertips will paint me rainbows in the night
You're my thunder my rain
Into darkness you bring light
Into darkness you bring light

Tell me who sent you? (My girl)
Tell me who made you?
'Cause when I look at you I see

God is a woman
God must be a woman
God must be a woman
God is a woman
God is a woman
God is a woman
God must be a woman
'Cause when I look at you, I see...
God is a woman
God must be a woman
God must be a woman
God is a woman
God is a woman
God is a woman
God must be a woman
You might also like
A million of good reasons couldn't take us apart
You moved into my body, my soul, my heart
I knew it from the very start
You singin' all the songs in my personal charts
You makin' me a planet in a world full of stars
In a world that is full of stars

Tell me who sent you?
Tell me who made you?

God is a woman
God must be a woman
God must be a woman
God is a woman
God is a woman
God is a woman
God must be a woman
'Cause when I look at you, I see...
God is a woman
God must be a woman
God must be a woman
God is a woman
God is a woman
God is a woman
God must be a woman
I need you 'til the day I die
'Cause when I look at you, I see

God is a woman
God must be a woman
God must be a woman

God must be a woman
'Cause when I look at you, I see...
