Mama was queen of the mambo, Papa was king of the Congo
Deep down in a jungle I start banging my first bongo
Every monkey like to be in my place instead of me
'Cause I'm the king of bongo, baby, I'm the king of bongo bong
I went to the big town where there is a lot of sound
From the jungle to the city, looking for a bigger crown
So I play my boogie for the people of the city
But they don't go crazy when I'm banging on my boogie

I'm the (King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong)
King-ki-ring-king, king-a-rim of bongo

King-ki-ring-king, king-a-rim of bongo

Nobody like to be in my place instead of me
'Cause nobody go crazy when I'm banging on my boogie
I'm a king without a crown, hanging loose in a big town
But I'm the king of bongo, baby, I'm the king of bongo bong

Banging on my bongo, all that swing belongs to me
I'm so happy there's nobody in my place instead of me
