There is someone we should talk about
Something you should know
Hehe
I like your smile and the way you talk
I love your style and the way you walk
I love your hair and your lips
Your underwear and your hips
I love your cheeks and your sexy legs
Your two feet and your nasty back
I love your tongue and your bum bum
Your belly button and even your mom
I love everything about you girl
Don't you understand?
I love you from head to toe, girl
But I hate your boyfriend
I love everything about you girl
Don't you understand?
I love you from head to toe, girl
But I hate your boyfriend
Hey hey hey hey
You know what I mean
Hey hey hey ho
Forget about him
Hey hey hey ho
Don't you understand?
Hey hey hey-oh
I hate your boyfriend!
You might also likeI hate your boy with all my heart
He wasn't smart from the very start
He's a fake, ain't no man
Not even able to count to ten
He lies to you every word he speaks
When you turn around he's the first to cheat
So come on girl, choose your joy:
You can pick me or your little boy
I love everything about you girl
Don't you understand?
I love you from head to toe, girl
But I hate your boyfriend
I love everything about you girl
Don't you understand?
I love you from head to toe, girl
But I hate your boyfriend
Hey hey hey hey
You know what I mean
Hey hey hey ho
Forget about him
Hey hey hey ho
Don't you understand?
Hey hey hey-oh
I hate your boyfriend

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Baby don't you understand
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Drop your boy, drop your friend
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
He shouldn't be your man
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just drop your boyfriend
I love everything about you girl
Don't you understand?
I love you from head to toe, girl
But I hate your boyfriend
I love everything about you girl
Don't you understand?
I love you from head to toe, girl
But I hate your boyfriend
Hey hey hey hey
You know what I mean

Forget about him
Hey hey hey ho
Don't you understand?
