One, two, three, four!

Baby, you're my freak once in a week
We gettin' kind of deep in my '86 jeep
I don't play no tricks, you know the bomb ticks
The only style I play is my self-made hits

And it kicks like that, yo' it really does
Was it number one? Hey yo, it really was
I got the swing, the king's back in the ring
Ladies throw their bras when I start to sing

Can I rock it? Can I knock it?
Can I lick it? Can I kick it? Can I top it?
You make me hazy, you drive me crazy
And baby, I don't know what I can do
Can I rock it? Can I knock it?
Can I lick it? Can I kick it? Can I top it?
You make me hazy, you drive me crazy
And baby, I don't know what I can do

We can do somethin' fantastic that you never knew
Forget you live in plastic when I keep my eyes on you
I can't cool down because it's gettin' too hot
So please baby, please baby, never let us stop

Can I lick it? Can I kick it? Can I top it?
You make me hazy, you drive me crazy
