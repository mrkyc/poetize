Ladies and gentlemen
This is Mambo Number 5!

One, two, three, four, five
Everybody in the car, so come on let's ride
To the candy store around the corner
The boys say they want some ice cream, but I really don't wanna
Let's dance till we all fall down
We'll really party hearty to the mambo sound
I like Minnie, Goofy, Pluto, and Daisy
And as I continue, the gang is goin' crazy
So what can I do? I really beg you, my Lord
To me dancing is just like a sport
Anything fly, it's all good, let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet

A little bit of Minnie in my life
A little bit of Mickey by her side
A little bit of Donald's all I need
A little bit of Daisy's what I see
A little bit of Pluto in the sun
Huey, Dewey, Louie can't go wrong
A little bit of Goofy everyone!
A little bit of him makes life so fun
Mambo Number 5!
You might also like
Jump up and down and move it all around
Shake your head to the sound
Put your hands on the ground
Take one step left and one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this then you're doin' it right

A little bit of Minnie in my life
A little bit of Mickey by her side
A little bit of Donald's all I need
A little bit of Daisy's what I see
A little bit of Pluto in the sun
Huey, Dewey, Louie can't go wrong
A little bit of Goofy everyone!
A little bit of him makes life so fun

Trumpet!
The trumpet!
Mambo Number 5!
Ha, ha, ha!

A little bit of Minnie in my life
A little bit of Mickey by her side
A little bit of Donald's all I need
A little bit of Daisy's what I see
A little bit of Pluto in the sun
Huey, Dewey, Louie can't go wrong
A little bit of Goofy everyone!
A little bit of him makes life so fun
I do all to
Fall in love with a girl like you
'Cause you can't run and you can't hide
You and me gonna touch the sky
