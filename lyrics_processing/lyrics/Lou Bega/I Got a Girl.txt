Six, seven, eight, nine, ten
Lou Bega on a trip, would you all come in
With a little bit of this and a little bit of that?
You can get what you see, you can see what you get
And I bet that you're all a little bit excited
If you need an autograph: "Honey, I can write it!"
I got girls worldwide on the planet
Some called Whitney and some called Janet

I got a girl in Paris, I got a girl in Rome
I even got a girl in the Vatican Dome
I got a girl right here, I got a girl right there
And I got a girlfriend everywhere
I got a girl on the Moon, I got a girl on Mars
I even got a girl that likes to dance on the stars
I got a girl right here and one right there
And I got a girlfriend everywhere

From Miami Beach to Beluga Bay
From the Milky Way to East LA
From St. Tropez to my home cafe
That's my way and I do it like day by day
In Africa, America, Europe and Australia
Asia, Canada; I take 'em all and marry her
India, Arabia, to the girls of Germany
All around the planet, you can be my fantasy

I got a girl right here, I got a girl right there
And I got a girlfriend everywhere
I got a girl on the Moon, I got a girl on Mars
I even got a girl that likes to dance on the stars
I got a girl right here and one right there
And I got a girlfriend everywhere

You and me
No matter where you from, baby

Baby, only you and me
