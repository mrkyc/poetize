"Ice cream! Ice cream!
Yeah, baby. You wanna lick this ice cream?"
"Got a little bit of banana?"
"Aight."
"Chocolate, vanilla, banana flavor."
"How 'bout that!"

(Whoop whoop!)
(Whoop whoop!)
(Whoop whoop!)
(Whoop whoop!)

I'm the ice-cream man known as mellow
Now would you like to say hello to my fellow?
Me and my amigos sittin' all on a bench
Somewhere down in Puerto Rico
Two cocoa-honeys step by "Hi!"
They lookin' manefico, so I
Step to 'em, yeah, how you doin'?
I took a close second 'cause I knew that I knew 'em
Bingo! Let me drop all my lingo
I make you understand that I am still single
So honey, don't you worry, no way
I got a truck full of plastics here to stay

(Whoop whoop!) Just ride a little!
(Whoop whoop!) Baby, baby, get down!
Little in the middle, surrounded by a big round
(Whoop whoop!) Just slide a little
(Whoop whoop!) Just ride a little!
(Whoop whoop!) Baby, baby, get down!
Little in the middle, surrounded by a big round

Chocolate, banana, vanilla flavor
You can try any damn thing, I do you that favor
But later on, you gots to be here by my side
Waitin' for a saddle to ride, ha
We gonna do a thing that's mega
I am havin' way more sex than them kiddies playin' Sega
Like Noriega, I am dictatin' the game
And I don't stop until you scream out my name
So honey, don't you worry, no way
I got a truck full of plastics here to stay

(Whoop whoop!) Just slide a little
(Whoop whoop!) Just ride a little!
(Whoop whoop!) Baby, baby, get down!
Little in the middle, surrounded by a big round
(Whoop whoop!) Just slide a little
(Whoop whoop!) Just ride a little!
(Whoop whoop!) Baby, baby, get down!
Little in the middle, surrounded by a big round
"Ha-ha, yeah, havin' fun!"
"Now would you all slide a little, ride a little, smile a little
And spend a little time with me? Woo-yeah!"
"So would you all stop standin' around?
Bring that butt on the dance floor! Let's get it on
Tonight's the night! Ha-ha. Ahhhw!!!"
"Yeah, yeah, come on, come on!
That's how we like it! Ha-ha, come on!
Woah! Yeah! Ay!"

(Whoop whoop!) Just slide a little
(Whoop whoop!) Just ride a little!
(Whoop whoop!) Baby, baby, get down!
Little in the middle, surrounded by a big round
(Whoop whoop!) Just slide a little
(Whoop whoop!) Just ride a little!

Little in the middle, surrounded by a big round
