You say she could be the one
How she can touch your heart
And you say that she knows what to do
You say, that she cares for you
Now I realize what I missed out in you
Cause I took you for granted , for granted ,for granted
You gave me your heart and still I let you go
Cause I took you for granted , for granted ,for granted
Baby I realize i had it all
Cause I took you for granted , for granted ,for granted
I should've known before I let you go
Cause I took you for granted , for granted ,for granted
Now I'm here alone and lost without you
So lost so lost with out you baby
You say that she treats you right
You say that she stands by your side
Never tries to harm you
She's always thinking of you
And you say that she's faithful
You say, that you are thankful
She always says I Love You, does everything
To have you

This the reason, we're apart
Now I know you won't come back
Cause I took you for granted , for granted ,for granted
You gave me your heart and still I let you go
Cause I took you for granted , for granted ,for granted
Baby I realize i had it all
Cause I took you for granted , for granted ,for granted

Cause I took you for granted , for granted ,for granted
Now I'm here alone and lost without you
