I'm not a homicidal maniac, I just murder the beat
You need to be my height to see what I see
And if your a midget grab a stepladder
So you can be on eye level with me
I never had a tragic life, didn't get beat up in school
Nor was I cool, I was just the common fool
Repping the old school, Never was my bag snatched
By some bad cat, or some snitch rat, Or some blood
King, or crip, who gunned down fags with a gat
Never bullied or bullied by the kid who was too fat
To the point he stumbled when he breathed
It wasn't like that, But now I'm sippin gold bottles
With those classy models, I only set my example
Which everyone else follows, I'm a bad influence to some
To others I'm a good role model, Got my children following my lead
Fuck with me they get riled, might get ya gunned down and clapped
Cause your walking around the wild, I call the streets where I live
The jungles of madagascar, your walkin through bushes and weeds
When suddenly someone gets ya, Bring ya back to my throne
I'm the jury set the verdict, also the judge, bang my gavel
And ya wish ya never heard it, Death to those who go against me
Let you bleed, then toss your body in the sea, Because sharks need to feed
Making money like I'm pushing weed, while selling cd's, writing raps with
Great ease, couldn't do it any better than me, Because there is only one king
I call the rap game my England, And these record companies, are just colonies, that I be feeding

I'm the great white shark, and jaws stays under me
But you might say I'm a hybrid, I rule the land and the sea
While under the ocean I got atlantis under seige
And while I stay on dry earth, I got bitches fufilling my needs
I'd eat the pussy out, but I have razor sharp teeth, so it's more
Like I devour the bitch, got her dropping to her knees
And I don't care if she gonna beg or plead, want me to pleasure you
Then you gotta pleasure me, Thats just equality, And I stay ontop of my grind
It's shit you couldn't believe, How did I make it to the top with
All this bullshit and greed, But thats really just on a need to know basis
Get them haters out my face, cause they could never face it
I'm to this rap shit, as crooked teeth are to braces, And I don't
Really give a fuck if you find the shit I say abrasive, So I
Bend over and drop my pants, show you my ass, kiss and taste it
And I don't have all the time in the world, so don't fucking waste it
Use your common sense, if you haven't misplaced it, Your going about as fast as an atv
And I'm a spaceship, So I know you don't really wanna race it, Emptying shells
And bullet cases, popping tires and blowing faces, in such a well
Organized fashion I don't leave any traces, But thats how you play it
Without getting caught, and even the tiniest mistake can cut your life short
But man, I really thought, you would've had some knowledge in your head
But your fucking with the shark of the land, no wonder you'd wind up dead
Corpse torn apart, bones shattered, and covered in red, Guess its
Time to bury you in your dirt bed, and your caskets a blanket, and your
Tombstone reads, "please pray for this idiot," Because you fucked with
The wrong shark kid, And your kind of unlucky your friends didn't warn ya
