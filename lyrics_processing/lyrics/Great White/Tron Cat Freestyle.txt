You can't take my lyrics seriously, well that's too fucking bad
So I decided to spit on a track like tron cat, I like more cushion for the pushing
So I fuck a bitch who's fat, also used as a human sheild, unlike a bitch who's flat
Like a door mat, or a table, or a skateboard, I get mad at bitches who reject
Me and call them whores, then all my friends think that I'm cool, so I take that
Infected Bitch, and drown her in my swimming pool, thats what you call news
Strip naked on the camera, then fuck the dead body, smack her cheeks, and pinch her ass
Then I dick slap her, I'm a fucking grizzly bear, because my hood is the woods
I'll tear your poaching ass to bits, like a violent tiger wood
I'm not a blood, or a crip, or a king. I just shoot up your block to get everything
That I could have ever imagined, raiding houses, stealing couches, going through your
Wifes closet, forcing her to wear sexy blouses, but I'm quiet as a mouse, but bitch
I'm the mother fucking fox, duct tape her slutty mouth, while I plow her vaginal box
And tear her body in two, its me, you, and you, but next I'm coming for you, and you too
I'm a mother fucking ogre, and you're my fiona, but there won't be a happy ending
Until I bone ya, Bust green slime in your face, kick you out the shack
And you slip on the swampy waters, and fall onto your ass

With little bugs, crawling up and down your back
Eating holes into your skin, it's a smell I can't resist
The flesh of a dying woman, I love to drink her blood when its thin
And if you have a fucking problem you're going to get skinned
When I hold a funeral, I make sure its proper
Won't stop burying bodies until the cops come
I'm not sadistic, I'm more of an animal
Cut my nurse's arms off, tell her to hand me the scalpel
With it, I perform surgery on her spine
And paralyze the bitch while I hit her from behind
And shoot up an orphanage, while I drive by
On my big wheel, it seems I've lost more than half a mind
And I have half a mind, to set your date, and death time
While I ride on my bike, and bells start to chime
Throughout your neighborhood, in the darkest of night
Break into your house, and slash your throat with my knife
And I may get prison, for years, until life
Or maybe get the death sentence, which would be right
But I'll kill the guards, beat them against the jail bars
And take their handguns, and hotwire a police car
While I run over pedestrians, they scream "The devil got the best of him"
And I won't stop assaulting, until i tear all the hairs off your chin
And go as far as to anally rape your fellow kin
The great white shark commits the seven deadly sins
See Great White LiveGet tickets as low as $41You might also like
This is the same reason why you don't listen to odd future
Because we're the type of people to rape you after we shoot ya
And force you to tell the judge your daughter touching us wasn't our fault see
And have her claim she just has cerebral palsy
Running through poland with a nazi hand held high
Punt Pollack midgets to the clouds in the sky
Take it over to Israel where they'll get fried
In the ovens of prejudice set up by the great white
I'm a gay kid, but I love girls tits
Piss on children that don't get their way, and they throw fits
Knitting sweaters after collecting grandma skins
And jack off, to the doodles of "the diary of wimpy kid"
Oh, I really haven't heard, shoot birds that try and say the word
Catch me beating Elliott, until she's bloody and scurred
Then I Let her search it, But you hear the elephants
They're charging right over her, feeling triumphant
Play seven minutes in heaven, with kids no older than eleven
They're in a fucking cucumber, spongebob trying to fuck kevin
In his sandy fucking cheeks, Time to confess to the reverend
That I've been watching horse pornography since I was seven
Cross swords in a jerking circle when I am high
And nut on airplanes passing by when I sky dive
Slash my wrists just so my dick can get erectified
