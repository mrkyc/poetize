Another's woman and I can't keep away
Can't be alone wasting all of my time
I'm in pain i'm in heartache
It's going to end up in a heartbreak
And no one knows how to make it all right
I've seen love before
And I can't take this any more
No no no no someone's losing her heart
You've got the loving that gives me peace of mind
I'm still here waiting for her to see the light
It would be so good it would be so fine
Give me the love that you know is mine
It would be so good it would be so fine
Just let me know when your heart is mine
To love a brother to love another
To have a friend you can count on forever
How can you tell him his loving is mine?
I've seen love before
And I can't take this any more
No no no no someone's losing her heart
