Just had a full night's sleep
I'm feeling so stuck, I'm so distracted
Ain't touched a thing all week
I'm feeling drunk, just too stoned and sloppy
Ain't touched a drink all night
I'm feeling hungry, can't see the reason
Just had a cold meat pie
Girl, when you call my name
I salivate like Pavlov's dog
Girl, when you lay me out
My heart is beating louder than a big bass drum
Now you got the mix
And, Audie, you got the sticks
And love is a bitch
Yeah, you got the mix
And, Audie, you got the sticks
Boy, and love is just a bitch
She's just a bitch, baby
And if I could sing you, if I could sing you
A love song so divine
Would it be enough for your cheating heart
Or would you think this boy's insane, he's insane?

Women behind bars
Women in fast cars
Women in distress
I like a lady with no dress
Women in aeroplanes
Women who play them games
Women in a uniform
See the woman with her clothes torn
Women who satisfy
Women you can't buy
Like the women in a magazine
And them ladies in the limousine
Women who sip champagne
Women who feel no pain
Women in a disco
Hanging around for the blow, blow, blow
Women wanting sympathy
Women taking ecstasy
Women that live in a fantasy
So why are they always living on their knees?
Women that fall in love
Women who need a shove
Women that can't be beat
Vheck out that lady in my back seat
Women in the USA
Them women steal your heart away
Women into rock and roll
Or the ladies in the back of the bus after the show
Women that we write songs about
Women that turn around and kick you out
Women you dream about all your life
Women that can't raise her feet in trouble and strife
Yeah, you got a mix
And, Audie, you got the sticks
Boy, but love is a bitch
Yeah, you got a mix
And, Audie, you got the sticks
Baby, but love is a bitch
She's a real cool bitch
She's a nasty bitch
