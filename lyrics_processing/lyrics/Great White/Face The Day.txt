I don't want to face the day
I don't want to face the day, the day today
Long nights leave me stranded
Black visions danger signs
No love, I need protection
Feels like I'm on a production line
Daggers of dawn, cold hearted day
Why does it have to be morning?
Cover my head, I'm staying in bed
Too late the loveless warning
I don't want to face the day, the day today
I don't want to face the day, the day today
Outside the screaming city
Red lights and hungry eyes
Sucks like a space invader
The vacuum of its lies
Stealing my strength, stealing my time
It's raining in a world of traders
I don't want to face the day
I don't want to face the day

Forget that I'm alone
One day of faceless living
Is twenty four hours too long
I don't want to face the day
I don't want to face the day
I don't want to face the day, the day today
Give me the night, it's more forgiving
Hold back the light from my eyes
Please stay, invisible darkness
Can't see the tears i cry
I know it's coming, loaded with nothing
Trapped in a tunnel of time
I don't want to face the day
I don't want to face the day
I don't want to face the day, the day today
I don't want to face the day, the day any day
I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to face the day
I don't want to face the day
Face the day
I don't want to face the day
I don't want to face the day
I don't want to face the day
I don't want to face the day
I don't want to face it
I don't want to face the day
I don't want to
I don't want to
I don't want to face it
I don't want to face the day
I don't want to face the day
