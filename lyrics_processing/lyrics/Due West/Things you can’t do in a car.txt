But she don't mind climbing in on mine 'cause that's where she rides
I work the clutch and she shifts the gears
We take a one way, unpaved to a place way outta here
Yeah, way outta here
Down a rough road where a car can't go
Up in the hills where you need four-wheel
Let down the tailgate watch her tan legs sway
To the rhythm of me strumming on my guitar
Lay back in the bed, lay her head on my chest
Beneath a billion stars
Doin' things you can't do, things you can't do
Doin' things you can't do in a car
This Saturday, I'm helping Tommy out
Hitch on the ball, we'll be hauling dry wall to his momma's house
Later on that night, when the work is done
I got a hot date, can't wait, my baby's gettin' made up
Yeah, to have a little fun
Down a rough road where a car can't go
Up in the hills where you need four-wheel
Let down the tailgate watch her tan legs sway
To the rhythm of me strumming on my guitar
Lay back in the bed, lay her head on my chest
Beneath a billion stars
Doin' things you can't do, things you can't do
Doin' things you can't do in a car

Hang a gun on the rack, hot tub in the back
Horsepower and a winch help a buddy out the ditch
Have some fun in the mud, maybe we can get stuck...
Down a rough road where a car can't go
Up in the hills where you need four-wheel
Let down the tailgate watch her tan legs sway
To the rhythm of me strumming on my guitar
Lay back in the bed, lay her head on my chest
Beneath a billion stars
Doin' things you can't do, things you can't do
Doin' things you can't do, things you just can't do
Doin' things you can't do, things you can't do
