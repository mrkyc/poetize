Hauntaholics, you bastard
I'm a bloody angel, totin' on them Dracos (Ah)
Posted graveyard with my bloody Haunted bros (Gang, gang)
By the silo, sippin' on some drank though (Ah)
Haugh

Posted graveyard with my bloody Haunted bros

I'm an angel, forever in the graveyard
I'm a bloody angel, totin' on them Dracos (Rah, rah)
Posted graveyard with my bloody Haunted bros (Gang, gang)

I'm so dead inside, but I still go dumb though (Dumb though)
Fucked up, mix the lean with oxycodone (Oxycodone)
Fuck the law, fuck the opps, I'm with my angels (Angels)
Robin wings on me 'cause I am a angel (Angel)
Skrrt, skrrt, riding out with Turn and HDOE (Skrrt, skrrt)
Chains rattle when we walk, Haunted Mound Reapers (Reapers)
And we can't escape our sins like Ebenezer
Riding 'round in hearse trucks like Jeeper Creeper
Blood on my jeans and blood on my T-shirt (Blood on my T-shirt)
I might be a fiend, fuck it, I wanna get higher (I wanna get higher)
With my Haunted Mound bros, rocking Haunted Mound polos (Polos)
Haunted Mound 'til I'm in the ground, you already know
