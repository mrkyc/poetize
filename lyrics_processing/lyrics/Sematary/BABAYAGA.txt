Once upon a time there was a pretty fly
He had a pretty wife, this pretty fly

(Real Haunted Mound)
Aw, fuck
Aw, fuck
You know what the fuck it is
Buckshot, what up?
Butcher House, the mixtape
Hauntaholics mixtape, Haunted Mound
Yeah
Butcher House, fuck the world, Haunted Mound, bitch
Sematary Grave Man on the fuckin' beat
Haaaauuughhhhhhhgg

Hop up in a hearse, now I'm swerving off
Voices in my head got me fucked up
Feel like Pyramid Head when my cutter up
Bitch, I'm Baba Yaga with my cutter up
Bitch, I'm Baba Yaga with my cutter up
Bitch, I'm Baba Yaga with my cutter up
Bitch, I'm Baba Yaga with my cutter up
Bitch, I'm, bitch, I'm, bitch I'm Baba Yaga with my cutter up

I could never change, nah, I think I'm a slave to it
Shawty is a slave to me, she gon' be my ritual
Fucking with the Haunted Mound, he can get it laid down
Sheet over his head, now it's a fucking ghost house
Riding 'round, riding 'round, I'ma walk up to your house
Little lamb, little lamb, Baba Yaga get ya' now
I been waitin' in the dark, born to die so I go hard
Robin jeans and Truey jeans, I'm swaggin' 'til I'm in the dirt
Motherfuck my liver, mix the oxy with the alcohol
I only got livin', I don't need a normal life at all
Nose is fucking bleeding from the coke, I wasted all the love
In my Butcher House tweaking, bitch, fuck all of y'all
Keep a blade on me so you better be nice to me
Hating ass bitch, go ahead, fucking step to me
I'ma live forever, bitch, this body don't mean nun' to me
Haunted Mound, bitch, and that's all I'ma ever be
Grave Man
