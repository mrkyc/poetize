Haunted Mound
Haunted Mound
Stay in my haunted house, I call it the butcher house
Ha-Ha-Hauntaholics

Haunted Mound, bitch, stick that cutter in your damn mouth
Sematary Grave Man, haunted 'til I'm in the ground
Still in the butcher house, coolin' with the Haunted Mound
I been smokin' coffin nails, ash 'em in my bitch mouth
When I bring my chainsaw out (Yeah), sound like the screams of hell (Yeah)
Boy said he so hard, watch his skin drying out
Sematary pull up with two knives, do ya funky town
I'ma take your jaw bone, you can't tell me shit now
Stay in my haunted house, I call it the butcher house
Murder house, snuff house, haunted house, my butcher house
Look at my belt and my chain and my watch, partner
Look at my knives and my guns and my soul, partner
I flex so damn hard, you'd think it was a funeral
Lord forgive me, on highway to hell forever
Haunted Mound Reapers put you down in the grave
Angels haunt my team, haunted souls in my chain
I'll haunt you forever if I die today
Try the Haunted Mound, boy, you can die today
