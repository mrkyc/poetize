Hi, my name is Sematary
And I like gettin' high
Grave Man
Yeah

Hi, my name is Sematary, and I like gettin' high
I like ridin' hearse trucks, speedin' through the night
Hi, my name is Grave Man, and I say, "Fuck life"
I just wanna turn up and watch the headlights
You'll never be us, but I guess you can try
You can be my Haunted girl if you like my Haunted guys
Rock my hockey mask, but I still smile
World is on fire, but I'ma still try
I don't wanna look back, I just wanna drive
I need a cigarette and I just need to die
I feel like a deer lost in the headlights
Every single day of my motherfuckin' life

In the night time, only time I feel alive
I been gettin' high, I been waiting 'round to die
All-All-All I see is headlights
All I see in the night is them bright headlights
In the night time, only time I feel alive
I been gettin' high, I been waiting 'round to die
Give a fuck 'bout moonlight
All I wanna see is them bright headlights
In the night time, only time I feel alive
I been gettin' high, I been waiting 'round to die
All I see is headlights
All I see in the night is them bright headlights
In the night time, only time I feel alive
I been gettin' high, I been waiting 'round to die
Give a fuck 'bout moonlight
All I wanna see is them bright headlights

Yeah, I know you feel what I'm sayin' right now, man
Why you wanna die?
If you wanna die, then go ahead and die
Trues hang off my ass, man, 'cause I don't give a fuck
I'm forever young, I wan' be forever dumb
I-I don't need drugs 'cause, bitch, I'm high on drugs
And I don't need your love 'cause, bitch, I'm high on drugs
Blood from her eyes shining like my bloody watch
Blood red Louis bag, fill it up with guns
It's all blurred out, fucked up, can't see none
Except the headlights from the Jeeper Creeper truck

In the night time, only time I feel alive
I been gettin' high, I been waiting 'round to die
All-All-All I see is headlights
All I see in the night is them bright headlights
In the night time, only time I feel alive
I been gettin' high, I been waiting 'round to die
Give a fuck 'bout moonlight
All I wanna see is them bright headlights
In the night time, only time I feel alive
I been gettin' high, I been waiting 'round to die
All I see is headlights
All I see in the night is them bright headlights
In the night time, only time I feel alive
I been gettin' high, I been waiting 'round to die
Give a fuck 'bout moonlight
All I wanna see is them bright headlights
