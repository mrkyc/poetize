DJ Sorrow (Yeah, forest fire)
I'm on the Rainbow Bridge

Forest fire, damn him, hellfire
Ridin' round town, we gon' pull an all-nighter
Grab my chainsaw, please, fuckin' try us
Turn your girl to a witch, now she dancin' 'round my fire
Forest fire, damn him, hellfire
Smoke coffin cougher, thousand weepin' choirs
Skincarver, you know we some monsters
Dirty jean rocker, world's a forest fire

Fucked up, light my cig with a molotov
Got your freak, I'ma ash a smoke in her mouth
Willows, take you down where the trees howl
Sematary let these lil' bitch boys burn
The world is my ashtray, we ridin' out
Bitch, it's Grave Man, whip a fuckin' chainsaw
Cig smokin' firefighter, burn a cop alive
Bullhorns, cancer sticks, black smoke in my lungs
Fuck with me, I'ma cut your damn face off
Gasoline, we do arson by nightfall
We be ridin', ridin', ridin' all night long (Ahh)
My rage burn eternal like a forest fire

Forest fire, damn him, hellfire
Ridin' round town, we gon' pull an all-nighter
Grab my chainsaw, please, fuckin' try us
Turn your girl to a witch, now she dancin' 'round my fire
Forest fire, damn him, hellfire
Smoke coffin cougher, thousand weepin' choirs
Skincarver, you know we some monsters
Dirty jean rocker, world's a forest fire

Burning bright in the forest of the night
Dirt road, blinded by the headlights
Outside, cold night, frostbite
Buckshot in the trees, out of sight
Forest fire, comin' from the briars
Haunted Mound choir, we gon' slash your tires
Michael Myers, knife and barbed wire
Burn it to the ground, bitch, this your funeral pyre
Ghost story told around the campfire
Facedown in a ditch, hitchhiker
Sun's comin' up, I think it's gettin' brighter
Up for three weeks, no, I'm not gettin' tired

Forest fire, damn him, hellfire
Ridin' round town, we gon' pull an all-nighter
Grab my chainsaw, please, fuckin' try us
Turn your girl to a witch, now she dancin' 'round my fire
Forest fire, damn him, hellfire
Smoke coffin cougher, thousand weepin' choirs
Skincarver, you know we some monsters
