Well, give me whiskey, and I'll get loaded
Feel like a stick man and I'm burning
Bitch, I'm Blair Witch, I got sigil
I'm Nicolas Cage with the chainsaw
I got big guns and they're a-blowing
I got cutters and they're a-cutting
I'ma smoke 'til my lungs are rotten
I'm driving nails all up in my coffin
Ain't got a passport, but I got a shotgun
Can't feel nothing, bitch, nothing at all
Try the Haunted Mound, you'll meet your maker
Off hate and gasoline, I'll ride forever

All I need is hate and gasoline
And I will ride hard forever
All I need is hate and gasoline
And I will ride hard forever
All I need is hate and gasoline
And I will ride hard forever
All I need is hate and gasoline
And I will ride until the end

Ride around, I ride around with hate in my soul
Spark a flame, watch them ghosts burn up off my Zippo
Gettin' gone, anesthesia my oxycodone
Grab my mask, I pull up with my fucking chrome though
You would think I'm HDOE the way I work the iron
Big black Cadillac, run you under my tires
I'll sleep when I'm dead, but I'm so, so tired
I wanna set the motherfuckin' world on fire
Guzzolene high, goddamn, my knife shine bright
Coming for you in the night, bitch, I'm out for blood tonight
Gouged eyes, powerlines, I'ma chase you through the pines
All I know I'm born to die, all I know I'm born to die
You might also like
All I need is hate and gasoline
And I will ride hard forever
All I need is hate and gasoline
And I will ride hard forever
All I need is hate and gasoline
And I will ride hard forever
All I need is hate and gasoline
And I will ride until the end
