My friend, you are unique but not always
Some stranger you don't know has surely felt your pain
Some stranger out there might even own your name
And say all the things that you said
Your thoughts existing in someone else's head

It's true you are one of my favorite books to read
I have to thank you now, you've changed the way I think
And with each page I turn, there you are
And with each word I read rings true in my heart
While I was waiting, I found something I was missing
Might not have been a man, but why waste good-willed love on wishing
Please don't confuse me with your devastating stare-downs
I'll hold your mirror, all you have to do is turn around
So you can see the face you make when you are giving out your soul
Are you the only one who doesn't already know?

I used to think I was the only one
I used to think I was the only one
I used to think I was the only one
But I've learned quite a few things since then
I've learned that no one ever really is the only one

My friend, if it's alive, it will do anything
And if it's strong as well, believe it will go there
And if it's full of love, know it is capable of
Emptying itself out at any point at all
Just know the height you reach is the distance you could fall
Know your own heart well
It's the one that's worth most of your time
Know your own heart well
You could be surprised at what you find

My friend, you are unique but not always
Some stranger out there has surely felt your pain
Some stranger you don't know might even own your name
Has said all the things that you said
Thoughts existing in someone else's head

I used to think I was the only one
I used to think I was the only one
I used to think I was the only one
But I've learned quite a few things since then
