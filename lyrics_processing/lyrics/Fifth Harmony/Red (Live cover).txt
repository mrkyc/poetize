Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red, red, red
But loving him was red, red, red
But loving him was red, red, red, red, red, red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong
You might also like
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red, red, red
But loving him was red, red, red
Oohhh burning red, red, red, red, red, red
 & (Lauren) & Dinah & {Ally} & All]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks {flashbacks}  
(Tell myself it's time now) time now, gotta let go
{But moving on from} him is impossible
When I still see it all in {my head}

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody (you never met)
But loving him was red, red, red (was red)
But loving him was red, red, red (was red)
But loving him was red, red, red, red, red, red (red red)

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
