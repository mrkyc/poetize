It's been a while since I was lost for words
Needles and static and stutters
I never knew a love that doesn't hurt
Feeling the heat and the burn

Just give me one good reason, drop everythin' and leave it
Seconds away from turnin' this car back around
Somethin' about your feeling pushin' and pullin' me in
And now my walls fall down

Usually fearless, why am I scared of happy?
Usually fearless, why am I scared of happy?
I'm afraid of nothing, I'm afraid of no one
Used to be fearless, why am I scared of happy?

Scared of happy

There is something good in sticking to your guns
No one to blame but yourself
I take a step back and I breathe for once
This is what I want
You might also like
You give me one good reason, drop everythin' and leave it
Seconds away from pullin' up outside your door
It's something about your feeling pushin' and pullin' me in
That's why I come back for more

Usually fearless, why am I scared of happy?

When it all goes down, mm
When it all goes down (When it all goes down)
Will you still be around?
I'm comin' back, no more runnin' away
