Callin' all my girls
There's an SOS tonight, let's have some fun, yeah
One hundred percent
Every single trace of my weekdays are gone, yeah

There's gotta be a million faces up in this room, room
But the only one who gets my attention is you, you

I got my best on
And I feel like dancin' all night long
Nothing's gonna stop me, you're what I want
So, baby, come and get me, 'cause I don't wanna dance alone
Oh, it's been so long
Thinkin' 'bout the feelin' of your arms
Wrapped around my body, that's what I want
So, baby, come and get me, 'cause I don't wanna dance alone

Out on the floor
I can feel you starin' at me across the room, oh
What you waitin' for?
All I want is you, so come and make your move, oh
You might also like
I see a million silhouettes dancin' in this room, room
I wanna be the one who gets the attention from you, oh

I got my best on
And I feel like dancin' all night long
Nothing's gonna stop me, you're what I want
So, baby, come and get me, 'cause I don't wanna dance alone
Oh, it's been so long
Thinkin' 'bout the feelin' of your arms
Wrapped around my body, that's what I want
So, baby, come and get me, 'cause I don't wanna dance alone

If you come in close then I won't say, "No"
Baby, all I want is you
If you move too slow then you'll never know
All the things that we could do
If you come in close then I won't say, "No"
Baby, all I want is you
If you move too slow then you'll never know
All the things that we could do

I got my best on (I got my best on)
And I feel like dancin' (Feel like dancin' all)
All night long (All night long)
Nothing's gonna stop me, you're what I want (You're what I want)
So, baby, come and get me, 'cause I don't wanna dance alone
Oh, it's been so long
Thinkin' 'bout the feelin' of your arms (Your arms)
Wrapped around my body, that's what I want
So, baby, come and get me, 'cause I don't wanna dance alone ('Lone)
Don't let me dance alone
