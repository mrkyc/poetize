Do you have a moment? Boy, we need to talk
It's a conversation that's been comin' on, oh
Why you want me livin' like I'm in a cage?
I'm just tired of hopin' that you're gonna change, oh

I'm just out here, baby, livin' my life (My life, my life, my life)
And I just have to say, you got no right

You're so sensitive, baby
And I love it about you
But you're drivin' me crazy
'Cause you're jealous in love
You're so sensitive, baby
And I don't wanna hurt you
But I'm movin' on
Yeah, I'm movin' on, on

Ooh
Ooh (Ooh, baby)

You can find a new love, she can be the kind
That'll let you keep her right there by your side

And I just have to say, you got no right (Got no right)

You're so sensitive, baby (You're so sensitive)

But two empty halves make for one empty hole (Ooh)
In the pit of my stomach and in the pit of my soul
