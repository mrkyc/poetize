It's crazy how that four letter word gets tossed
And I'm guilty, said it so many times before
But I can't front no more

You're the only one that's givin' me these chills

'Cause love never got me this high
I said I love you, but I lied
'Cause everything's different this time (Oh no)

I said I love you, but I lied
'Cause love never got me this high

No, nah-nah, yeah
See, the truth is (Truth is) you can't lose what you never had
And you got me so bad

You're the only one (Only one) that's givin' me these chills
(Givin' me these chills)

Thought I found the one every time

I said I love you, but I lied
'Cause love never got me this high (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
I said I love you, but I lied
'Cause everything's different this time (Come on, no, hey)
