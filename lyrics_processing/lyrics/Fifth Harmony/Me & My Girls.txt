And we play our favorite songs
And we scream out all night long
Like, ooh-ooh, oh
When it's just me and my girls

All the lights, turn them off, it's too loud in here to talk
I don't understand a word you say
Gotta sleep, but instead, karaoke on the bed
Taking duckface selfies right and left

We get crazy with it, we get stupid with it
We don't care if people stare when we wobble with it
We get diva on it, we get Queen B on it, yeah
We get Britney, Demi, One Direction, Bieber on it

And we play our favorite songs
And we scream out all night long
Like, ooh-ooh, oh
When it's just me and my girls
And we dance like no one's watching
We crack up, booty poppin'
Like, ooh-ooh, oh
When it's just me and my girls (Watch me now)
You might also like
Me and my girls, me, me and my girls
Me and my girls, pop it, pop it
Me and my girls, me, me and my girls
Me and my girls, pop it, pop it

My voice is gone, got my favorite PJs on
Times like this don't always come along
You're all I need, there's no where I'd rather be
Than to have you crazy freaks with me

We get crazy with it, we get stupid with it
We don't care if people stare when we wobble with it
We get diva on it, we get Queen B on it, yeah
We get Britney, Demi, One Direction, Bieber on it

And we play our favorite songs
And we scream out all night long
Like, ooh-ooh, oh
When it's just me and my girls
And we dance like no one's watching
We crack up, booty poppin'
Like, ooh-ooh, oh
When it's just me and my girls (Watch me now)
Me and my girls, me, me and my girls
Me and my girls, pop it, pop it
Me and my girls (Yeah), me, me and my girls (Oh)
Me and my girls, pop it, pop it

Break it down, now, break it down
Now, break it down, now, break it down (Uh, yeah, yeah)
Break it down, now, break it down
Now, break it down, now, break it down

And we play our favorite songs
And we scream out all night long
Like, ooh-ooh, oh
When it's just me and my girls
And we dance like no one's watching
We crack up, booty poppin'
Like, ooh-ooh, oh
