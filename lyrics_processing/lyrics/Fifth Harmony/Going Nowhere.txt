First off, give a girl some credit
I'ma keep on lovin' you
'Cause you be the realest all day and all night
And that's why you stay by my side (Ah, yeah)

Boy, you better act like you got some sense
'Cause you got a dime and it's money well spent
You ain't going nowhere

We'll be here all day
If you start pointin' fingers my way
I just wish you loved me, loved me, baby
If you can do that then I'll do the same, yeah

Love and hate is such a thin line

You'll be sorry if you say goodbye (Ah-ah-ah, yeah)
