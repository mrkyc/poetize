Every day is payday
Swipe my card, then I do the Nae Nae
You're talking to a lady
I want a Kanye-ye, not a Ray J
So that's a no, no
I'm a Maybach and you's a Volvo
This convo beat like Dre-e
I already know what you tryna say, hey
You say that you a baller and I see you tryna holla
But that ain't how I was brought up, next
Workin' for the money 'cause that's what my mama taught me
So your ass better show me some respect

Bo$$, Michelle Obama
Purse all heavy, gettin' Oprah dollars
