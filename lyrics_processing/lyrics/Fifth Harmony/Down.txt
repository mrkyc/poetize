I need somebody with some patience
'Cause you know I got a temperament
And yeah, you got a reputation
Nothin' that a little love can't fix
There ain't no kind of situation
Where I wouldn't cross a line for you

I would get up there and lie for you

When push come to shove
You show me love
When push come to shove, ayy

I'm gon' keep lovin' you down, down, down
Long as you're holding me down, down, down
