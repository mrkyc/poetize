It's all over Twitter, let's make it official
Throw me a tissue
Goodbye and God bless you

Talkin' shady every time they open up they mouth
And they try to block it, but we took a better route

I'm just statin' facts, I hope you got the memo
I ain't pressed, I ain't stressed
I ain't pressed, I ain't pressed, no
