Ooh
Oh, oh

Frozen in time
But in my mind there's no erasing you
I toss and I turn
It's gonna hurt no matter what I do

I'm trembling inside
No, I can't stop myself from shaking
Even though I, I know
You'd take my heart and break it, you'd break it

But every kiss and every breathless moment
(I'd do it all again)
Tryna make it right, but I know it'll all go wrong
(I'd do it all again)
'Cause I can't lie, I love you still
For all my life, I always will
Even though I know how this story ends
I'd do it all again (Oh, babe)
You might also like
Remembering when
You'd made me dance around the living room
It still makes me smile
I don't know how to let go of you

But now that you're gone
I can't stop myself from crying
I gotta move on, but I'm not strong
I'll keep on tryin', I'm tryin'

But every kiss and every breathless moment
(Every kiss, every moment, I'd do it all again)
Tryna make it right, but I know it'll all go wrong
(I'd do it all again)
'Cause I can't lie, I love you still
For all my life, I always will
Even though I know how this story ends
I'd do it all again

And I hate how much (How much) I still love you
You're such a tragedy
It's impossible to comprehend
This hold you got on me
But every kiss and every breathless moment
Tryna to make it right but I know it'll all go wrong
Ooh-oh, 'cause I can't lie, I love you still
For all my life, yeah, and I always will
Even though I know how the story ends

But every kiss and every breathless moment (Baby, but every kiss and every breathless moment)
(I'd do it all again)
Tryna make it right, but I know it'll all go wrong (It'll all go wrong)
(I'd do it all again)
'Cause I can't lie, I love you still
For all my life, I always will
Even though I know how this story ends
*I'd do it all again*

I'd do it all again
