(Fifth Harmony, yeah)
Ah-ah, huh, huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ever since I'm young, I'm tryna get it right
Every year, I'm working towards a goal
Don't sleep 'til we see the daylight
Living big, going up on the rope

I like seeing all the bright lights
Keep it up, pour it up for the night
Two times, I'ma get it two times
Double up, run it back on my mind

This is the life, life, life
This is the life, life, life
This is the life, life, life
This is the life, life, life (This is the life)
This is the life, life, life
This is the life, life, life (This is the life)
This is the life, life, life
This is the life (This is the life)

Tricking out, whippin' hard in the coupe (What?)
I'ma go, got a board to flight
Other time, there's a show I gotta do (Woo)

No stress, baby, you can find us
Getting down on a beach in Dubai (What?)
Pool side, sipping on a Mai Tai
Double up, run it back on my mind

This is the life, life, life
