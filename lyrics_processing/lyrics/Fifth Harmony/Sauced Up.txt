We can get sauced up
Forever we're young, we'll never get old
'Cause when I get sauced up
I be like, so what?
So what, so what?
So what, so what?

Your flow, no go
Don't you know I'm fluent in the bro-code?
I can make you come up off the bands though
Drop a couple, show me what you came for, ah

Disaronno on the rocks (On the rocks)
Fireball, lemon drop (Lemon drop)
One o'clock on the dot (On the dot)
Shut up, boy, you talk a lot (Uh)

So what we on right now? (Right now)
What we doin' right now?
I don't want no problems, I want power
I'm drivin', you follow
You might also like
We can get sauced up
Forever we're young, we'll never get old
Blame it on drunk love
We can explain it all tomorrow
I'll show you how to rock with the bass down low
I'll show you how to rock the way I roll
'Cause when I get sauced up
I be like, so what?
So what, so what?

Sauced up, sauced up
I be in my feelings when I'm sauced up
I be in my bag, feelin' bossed up
If it make you mad, baby, so what? (Ah)
