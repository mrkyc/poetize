Don't say you miss me
When you don't call
And don't say you're hurting
Without the scars
Don't promise me tonight
Without tomorrow too
Don't say you love me
Unless you do

We've been close, but inconsistent
You hold my heart at a safer distance, yeah
You think words can ease the tension
But you can't deny that something's missing

I need a little bit more
I need a little bit more
You gotta know what it's like
I know you been here before
I've been waiting
I've been patient
But I need a little bit more

So, don't say you miss me
When you don't call
And don't say you're hurting
Without the scars
Don't promise me tonight
Without tomorrow too
Don't say you love me
Unless you do (Unless you do)

How am I supposed to take it
When weeks go by and I'm still waiting?
I say I'm okay, but I can't fake it, yeah
Even when I try, yeah, something's missing

I need a little bit more
I need a little bit more (I need a little bit more)
You gotta know what it's like
I know you been here before
But I've been waiting
I've been patient
But I need a little bit more

So don't say you miss me
When you don't call (When you don't call)
Don't say you're hurting
Without the scars
Don't promise me tonight
Without tomorrow too
Don't say you love me
Unless you do (Unless you do)

Without tomorrow too
Don't say you love me (Oh, yeah)
Unless you do, unless you do (Oh)
I need a little bit more
