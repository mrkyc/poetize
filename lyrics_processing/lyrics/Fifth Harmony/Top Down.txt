Blaze it up and we'll be cruisin' with the top down
Rev up the engine, we'll be cruisin', watch it go down
Get in my truck and I'll be ridin' with my top down
With my top down, my top down

Yup, from a small town cruisin' through the big city
Where the fellas are cute and the girls are pretty (Hm-hm)
It's our world so you know it's going down
I ain't got a lotta money, but I got a lotta style
What, what?

Blaze it up and we'll be cruisin' with the top down
Rev up the engine, we'll be cruisin', watch it go down
Get in my truck and I'll be ridin' with my top down
With my top down, my top down

Electric city
Baby, you're mine tonight
Electric city
Don't you shine bright
Electric city
Baby, you light the way
Electric city
I think that I might stay
You might also like
Passed out real and I woke up realer
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, uh)
Me and my clique going hard and you feel us
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Come on let me take you for a ride
I ain't got a lotta money, but I got a lotta style
What, what?

Blaze it up and we'll be cruisin' with the top down
Rev up the engine, we'll be cruisin', watch it go down
Get in my truck and I'll be ridin' with my top down
With my top down, my top down

Electric city
Baby, you're mine tonight
Electric city
Don't you shine bright
Electric city
Baby, you light the way
Electric city
I think that I might stay

Blaze it up and we'll be cruisin' with the top down
Rev up the engine, we'll be cruisin', watch it go down
Get in my truck and I'll be ridin' with my top down
With my top down, my top down

Electric city
Baby, you're mine tonight
Electric city
Don't you shine bright?
Electric city
Baby, you light the way
Electric city
