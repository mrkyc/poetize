Kiss for a kiss, my two lips got you racing
Baby, we're guilty wherever we are
Angel, confess, let me be your salvation
I'll carry you through the dark


Let me give, let me give you something to believe in
You don't gotta, you don't gotta even have a reason
(You don't even gotta have, gotta have a reason)
You can love, you can love me, baby, all weekend
Come on, come on over here and sink your teeth in

'Cause if you wanna talk, baby, use your hands
If you wanna go make a move, you can
If you want a shot, baby, cock and pull
If you're gonna bite, be a big bad wolf (Ah-ooh)
'Cause if you wanna talk, baby, use your hands
If you wanna go make a move, you can
If you want a shot, baby, cock and pull
If you're gonna bite, be a big bad wolf

Ah-ooh, ooh, la-la-la
You might also like
Whisper your secrets and mine will take over
Swing like your chariot and let me ride
Drunk off my body, you'll never be sober
I'll be your poison tonight

Oh, woah
Oh, oh-oh

Let me give, let me give you something to believe in
You don't gotta, you don't gotta even have a reason
(You don't even gotta have, gotta have a reason, yeah)
You can love, you can love me, baby, all weekend
Come on, come on over here and sink your teeth in

'Cause if you wanna talk, baby, use your hands
If you wanna go make a move, you can (Make a move, you can)
If you want a shot, baby, cock and pull
If you're gonna bite (If you're gonna bite), be a big bad wolf (Ah-ooh)
'Cause if you wanna talk, baby, use your hands
If you wanna go make a move, you can (Can)
If you want a shot, baby, cock and pull
If you're gonna bite, be a big bad wolf (Be a big bad wolf)
Don't hold back back, baby
Give me that, baby
Come do anything you want, la-la-la (Ooh)
Don't hold back, baby (No, no, nah)
Give me that, baby (Ooh)
I'll do anything you want

'Cause if you wanna talk, baby, use your hands ('Cause if you wanna talk)
If you wanna go make a move, you can (You can)
If you want a shot, baby, cock and pull
If you're gonna bite (If you're gonna bite), be a big bad wolf (Be a big bad wolf)
'Cause if you wanna talk, baby, use your hands (Baby, use your hands)
If you wanna go make a move, you can (Make a move, you can)
If you want a shot, baby, cock and pull
