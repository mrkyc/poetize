New Jersey tongue
Not saying too much
I'm feeling your attitude
That East Coasting, baby
Is driving me crazy
Just like it's supposed to do
With hands that could save me
Face that could break me
Sort of in love with you
But I wouldn't say that to ya

And now I'm tryna find the words
To tell you how I feel and show you that it's real
And now I'm tryna find the words, oh

I don't know what else to say
But you're pretty fucking dope
Just so you know
I've been thinking 'bout ways
That I wanna hold you close
Just so you know
I don't know what else to say
But you're pretty fucking dope
Oh, just so you know
Oh, woah (Oh, huh, ah)
I don't know what else to say
But you're pretty fucking dope

Do you got a girlfriend?
'Cause if you don't
Then I'm comin' after you
Don't wanna be selfish
But I can't help it
I'm wantin' more of you
I know I'm cool as shit
You want more of it
This much I know is true
But I wouldn't say that to ya

And now I'm tryna find the words
To tell you how I feel and show you that it's real
