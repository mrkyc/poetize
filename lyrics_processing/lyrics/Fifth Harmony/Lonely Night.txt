Now that I got your attention (Yeah)
You better listen up 'cause I got questions
So, why you late night textin'?
And why you likin' every pic of my best friend?

Get ya, get ya, get ya shit together (Uh-huh)
Get ya, get ya, get ya shit together (Uh-huh)
Boy, I got 20/20 vision
And that's the reason I'ma keep my distance

Must be confused about me (What?)
Must be confused about me (What?)
No room for fools around me
Ayy, ayy, ayy

If you don't treat ya mama right, bye-bye, bye-bye
If you got another chick on the side, bye-bye, bye-bye
You look everywhere but my eyes, bye-bye, bye-bye
It's gonna be a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely night
Bye-bye

Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely night
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely night
