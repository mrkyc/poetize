Can't spend time in rewind, I'm sorry
Many times I remind myself
We've come way too far in our stories, ah, ah
To build these walls and to blind ourselves
And for every action, there's a reaction

And I know the world can be cold, we can't let it divide us
There's something inside us, a power that grows
There's something beautiful in the flaws in all we are
Something calling all of us and it says

We build bridges
Oh, we build bridges
No, we won't separate
We know love can conquer hate
So we build bridges
Bridges, not walls (We build)
Bridges, not walls
Bridges, not walls

I believe in the beauty of love (Hey)
I believe that we really are one
I believe every woman is a fighter
And I believe every man can stand beside her

And I know the world can be cold, we can't let it divide us
There's something inside us, a power that grows
There's something beautiful in the flaws in all we are
Something calling all of us and it says

We build bridges (We build)
Oh, we build bridges
No, we won't separate
We know love can conquer hate
So we build bridges (Ah)
Bridges, not walls (We build)
Bridges, not walls
Bridges, not walls

All I pray is we break our chains
Because love's worth fighting for, shed your light on (We build)
All I pray is we break our chains
Because love's worth fighting for, shed your light on (We build)
All I pray is we (Yeah, yeah) break our chains
Because love's worth fighting for, shed your light on (We build)
All I pray is we break our chains (Praying, yeah)
Because love's worth fighting for, shed your light
So we build bridges (We build)
(All I pray is we break our chains)
So we build bridges
(Because love's worth fighting for, shed your light on)
So we build bridges
(All I pray is we break our chains)
So we build bridges
(Because love's worth fighting for, shed your light)

We build bridges (We build, we build bridges, we build bridges)
Oh, we build bridges (We build bridges, we build bridges)
No, we won't separate (We build bridges)
We know love can conquer hate (We build bridges)
So we build bridges (We build bridges)
Bridges, not walls (We build)
