Pick up the pen
Put it on the paper
Write on my skin
Bring me to life
Can't start again
There ain't no eraser
All of my flaws
You got them so right

Everything is blank until you draw me
Touching on my body like you know me

Write on me
Color outside the lines
Love the way you tat me up
Baby, take your time
Write on me
Gimme some wings, I'll fly
Love the way you tat me up
I'll never change my mind

Write on me
Write on me
Write on me
Write on me (Write on me)
Write on me (Write on me)
Write on me
Love the way you tat me up
Write on me
You might also like
You are my friend
Straight and no chaser
Burns going down
But it keeps me alive
Tell me the truth
I like the danger (Danger)
'Cause in the end
You will be mine

Everything is gray until you draw me
Touching on my body like you know me

Write on me
Color outside the lines
Love the way you tat me up
Baby, take your time
Write on me
Gimme some wings, I'll fly
Love the way you tat me up
I'll never change my mind

Write on me
Write on me
Write on me
Write on me
I could see a city sleep (Ooh)
I could see an ocean wave (Ooh)
Everything is changing (Ooh)
And it's written on my face (Ooh)
I could see a city sleep (Ooh)
I could see an ocean wave (Ooh)
Everything is changing (Ooh)
And it's written on my face (Ooh)

Write on me
Color outside the lines
Love the way you tat me up
Baby, take your time
Write on me
Gimme some wings, I'll fly
Love the way you tat me up
I'll never change my mind (Write on me)

Write on me (Write on me)
Write on me (Write on me)
Write on me (Write on me)
Write on me (Write on me)
Write on me (Won't you write on me? Yeah)
Write on me
Love the way you tat me up
Write on me
Write on me
Write on me
