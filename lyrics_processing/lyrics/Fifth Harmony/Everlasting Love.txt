Ever, ever, ever (Uh, ah)
Oh, ever, ever, ever (Fifth Harmony, baby, yeah)
Oh, ever, ever, ever (Let's go, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, everlasting love (Another one)

Always lookin' over my shoulder
'Cause I don't ever wanna miss you
I've been thinkin' about you daily
I can't wait to see your face
And I don't even know you
But I know that I can't wait to kiss you
Somehow I know when we finally lock eyes
That you'll feel the same way

You're gonna be all I needed
You make me feel like a dream
Whoever you are, baby, you are
The one I'm waitin' for

You're my ever, everlasting love
My ever, everlasting love
And I'm never ever givin' up
'Til you're layin' next to me
I'm looking for that ever, everlasting love
Forever ever kind of touch
And I'll never ever get enough
Baby, we were meant to be
You might also like
Ain't no use in wasting my time
On just anybody, baby
I want exceptional, original
Someone I can't deny
I'm in love with you already
I know it sounds crazy, yeah
But I hope you save all you got for me
'Cause, baby, you're all mine (All mine)

You're gonna be all I needed
You make me feel like a dream
Whoever you are, baby, you are
The one I'm waitin' for

You're my ever, everlasting love
My ever, everlasting love
And I'm never ever givin' up
'Til you're layin' next to me
I'm looking for that ever, everlasting love
Forever ever kind of touch
And I'll never ever get enough
Baby, we were meant to be
Everlasting love (Ever, ever, ever)
Everlasting love (Oh, ever, ever, ever)
Everlasting love (Oh, ever, ever, ever)
My everlasting love (Oh, everlasting love)

I don't even know your name (Mm-mm)
I can't get you off my brain (No, no)
Darling, I can hardly wait
'Til I can get to know you
You'll be beautifully insane (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Infinitely all for me (All for me)
Promise you'll be glad you came
And I can't wait to show you

You're my ever, everlasting love (You're my every)
My ever-everlasting love (Get enough)
And I'm never ever givin' up
'Til you're layin' next to me
I'm looking for that ever, everlasting love (Ever, ever)
Forever ever kind of touch (Ooh)
And I'll never ever get enough
Baby, we were meant to be (Baby, we were meant to be)
Everlasting love (Ever, ever, ever)
Everlasting love (Oh, ever, ever, ever)
Everlasting love (Oh, ever, ever, ever)
