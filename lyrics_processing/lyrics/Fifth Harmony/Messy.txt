I'll tell you straight how I feel with no filter
No touchin' up what you see, there's no filter

I can be cruel sometimes, out of my mind
Insecure and out the door
I am who I am and you won't have to wonder

I can be hard to handle
Dance around the house with nothin' but the radio on
I can be such a scandal
Runnin' at the mouth then crying on the bedroom floor
(I can be, be)

I can be messy
I can be messy, yeah, I admit it
I can be messy
I can get crazy, yeah, I admit it
Oh, no changin' (Oh no)
Oh, no changin'
I can be messy
Yeah, I can be messy, yeah, I admit it (Nah)
