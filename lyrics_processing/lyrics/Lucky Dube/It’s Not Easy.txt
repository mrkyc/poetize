I remember the day
I called mama on the telephone
I told her "Mama I'm getting married"
I could hear her voice
On the other side of the telephone
She was smiling
And she asked me a question that I proudly answered
She said "Son did you take time to know her?"
I said "Mama, she's the best"
But today it hurts me so
To go back to mama and say
"Mama I'm getting divorced!"
"Oh, I'm getting divorced!"

This choice I made
Didn't work out the way I thought it would
This choice I made
It hurts me so mama
This choice I made
Didn't work out the way I thought it would
This choice of mine, oh!
Mama said to me

It's not easy to understand it son
But I hope you will make it
You'll be happy again
It's not easy to understand it son
But I hope you will make it
You'll be happy again

I remember in church
When the preacher read the scriptures
You looked so beautiful, so beautiful and innocent
I did not know that behind that beauty
Lies the true colours that will destroy me in the near future

This choice I made
Didn't work out the way I thought it would be
Oh mama
This choice I made
Didn't work out the way I thought it would be
Now I'm hurting

I remember when I held you
By the hand preacher-man read the scriptures
Putting words in your mouth
Maybe what the preacher-man said
Was not something that was within you
Now I know what they mean when they say
"Beautiful woman is another man's plaything"
Oh Lord I'm hurting now

This choice I made
Didn't work out the way I thought it would
This choice of mine, oh!
Mama said to me
It's not easy to understand it son
But I hope you will make it
You'll be happy again
It's not easy to understand it son
But I hope you will make it
