Alright

Now everybody wants to know the truth about a brother named Quik
I come from the school of the sly, wicked, and the slick
A lot of people already know exactly where it's at
'Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack
(Compton) Yeah, that's the name of my hometown
I'm throwin' down in the town, where my name is all around
The suckers just be havin' a fit, and that's a pity
But I ain't doin' nothin' but (claimin' my city)
See, my lyrics I'm doublin' up, and provin' to suckers that I can throw 'em
I'm passin' a natural ten, or four, or six, or eight before I go
Yes, I'm definitely freestylin', all the while, still profilin'
Never trickster, DJ Quikster steals the show
So, yeah, that's how I'm livin', I do as I please, you see
A younger brother that's up on reality
'Cause everybody knows, you have to be stompin'
If you're born and raised in Compton

(Born and raised)

(Where you from, fool?)

Now, Compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see
But then, I found that it wasn't no place for me
'Cause way back in the day, somebody must of wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house, and cold stole my shit
They must of thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't going out like no sucker-ass clown
They found, they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, mothafucka, silly sucker-
Ass clucker, now you're duckin', 'cause you can't stop a brother
Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't gon' never be the same
'Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin' over
I really don't think I should have to explain it
Oh, yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin' no pain
Sometimes I have to wear the bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'CPT' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceasin' to impress
My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin' like this, and I'm comin' directly
'Cause suckers get dain-bramage if I'm doin' damage quite effectively
Rhymin' is a battlezone, and suckers have no hint
'Cause I'm a veteran from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N
Kick it
(Born and raised)
(Born, born and raised)

(Born and raised in Compton)

(Born, born, born, born and raised in Comp-)
