Ayo
We flyin' high speed
Boss major league
Smokin' high-grade weed
West Coast, baby
Where we bubble it's like this
"Bub bub bub bub bub bub bub bub"

Ayy, Shemar Moore said I'm doing the Crip Walk
(Crip Walk? Ah, you clowinin')
I shoulda smeared off his lip gloss
Keep it Compton, 'cause gangstas just ain't meanin' a thang
When y'all can come comercialize it with R&B singers
Sucker, I took speedknots, dumped with these rocks
Hit with these Glocks, tell them niggas I'm not
Pimpin' down to the bone, stuff in my dog tags
Gangsta broomstick that I'm stuffin' in y'all fags
'Cause everybody wanna be 'Pac
But dont nobody wanna fill them shoes before they feel them shots
And Mausberg is the realest (Forever)
But all it took was a punk, couple of coward's bullets to close his book
So fuck it
FTPD, that's what we yellin'
Dump ten times with a nine and keep bailin'
What can y'all do? What you already could?
Beat me down, drag me up and drop me in a Crip hood?
I'm trouble

Young stars are rollin', trouble in Beamer or Benz
Slowly down the street

Now baby, name one thing out here where y'all find free
Now you're right, you probably didn't have to mind that last motherfucker you was with
But bitch, you gon' mind me
Mayday mayday, Suga Free up to the pulpit
Because everybody know that the whole congregation need a little bullshit
"Where Rochelle?"
I dont know, man
After she put her panties on, she went in the house
And I think this time she really went to go tell
But daddy want it
Because he can pick his lazy ass up from a strip club, go home, lay down and she can squat down and potty on him
And to these high fickle beats
R. Kelly went from nothing to platinum to getting cum smelling little girls bicycle seats
And I ain't tryna get my diss on
But I'm a pimp, I'm from Pomona
I got a prostitute that'll take that couple hundred and you can go piss on her
"Hey little man, where Patti went?"
Probably in there waitin' on my mama to leave so she can go upstairs and suck my daddy's dick
Now run on
God gonna love you because He already made His mind up
He gonna love you whether you want Him to love you or not
So get up, GO!

Compton
Don't make me blow up, I'm seasoned, P the reason, you know
'Cause pimpin'll have you see me with a bad ass ho
Legendary my name, secondary you came
And you won't see me stop makin' hits 'til I walk with a cane
Yep, I'm still 5'11", 6 feet with shoes
Compton OG nigga givin' bitches the blues
Etched in stone, making your bitch fetch the bone
I'm callin' the cops, punk motherfuckers, catch the phone
The walkie talkie, the two-way and all of the above
Nightstick up they ass 'til we all see bloods
Now hold up, I'm a cop, too (What?)
I'ma cop me a kilo of meth and try to have 'em tweakin' like it's '92
With Monte Carlo, smoke European blunts
Pop them E pills, have that gold lace trippin' 'round the whole place
What's a six pack? Sucker, cop the whole case
And when them marks come, nigga, crack they whole face
'Cause when my Glock cock, keepin' niggas full
Got it spittin' like that pitcher from the KC Royals
Sock the PD, haters RIP
Very sincerely yours, Quik, nigga, peace
