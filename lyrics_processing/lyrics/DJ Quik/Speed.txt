Yeah, a rough vocal for my locos, ha
My nigga Hi-C, 2nd II None, ha, AMG

And the Q-U, the new, you knew I could flip it
To any particular groove, I came, okay now
Check it if you wanna, but it's all in vain
Because my game is still the same, perfection
Feel me as I fill you in
I never rode a pony, but I'm genuine
So give me just a little bit of nicotine and the sticky green
And I'ma hit her with the icky cream
Boo-yow, I hit her on the neck with the wet
And made the hooker jump without a safety net
Hit the ground, break her back, get up and do it again
'Cause she can really take a shot on the chin (Woo)
Caffeine, cappuccino, chase it with some NoDoz
Up all night like the moon glows, searchin' for new hoes
That really wanna follow my lead, indeed (Why?)
And give a nigga just what I need

When I'm on speed, I'm faster than most
And I can rock a party from coast to coast
When I'm on speed, I'm faster than most
And I can rock a party from coast to coast
When I'm on speed, I'm faster than most (Faster, guys)
And I can rock a party from coast to coast (Faster)
When I'm on speed, I'm faster than most
And I can rock a party from coast to coast
See DJ Quik LiveGet tickets as low as $82You might also like
The Q-U-I-K is the name I spell
One hundred and twenty-four beats per minute I rock well
Because I'm tight to the second power when I hit the liquor
And I don't serve emcees, I serve dickers (Uh, uh, uh, woo)
Bang-bang-boogie when I hit a shot of loogie (Hey)
And a booger tried to put it on me (Uh)
But I got vet moves to show her, I float it like Noah (Uh, hey)
And I struck that thigh like a boa
Constrictor when I dicked her down
Now you feel just like a circus clown when I work this
Jack of all trades, mastered a few
Test these testes, one, two (Uh, one, two)
Gettin' down with my nigga A-M to the G
In the PM hookers wanna see him (Hey)
Big cat callin', super fat ballin'
Indeed, give us what we need (What?)

When I'm on speed, I'm faster than most
And I can rock a party from coast to coast
When I'm on speed, I'm faster than most
And I can rock a party from coast to coast
When I'm on speed, I'm faster than most
And I can rock a party from coast to coast
When I'm on speed, I'm faster than most (Hey, ayy)
And I can rock a party from coast to coast
Faster than the Concorde, on board, call me the pilot
Baby better let me know she's excited
In a Testarossa, sippin' mimosas
Girls want me to sign posters
International is the steelo
Got hookers from Cancun to Rio
Flyer than United, boy, don't even try it
You can't buy it, got freaks at the Hyatt
Hit the weed up then turn the speed up
The booty from the back's the only way I eat up
Quicker than Jackie Chan
I stretch out the coochie like a rubber band
She wanna be more than the average fan
But the ho needs a job and a man and a retirement plan
So, baby, don't cry the blues
'Cause I know a gang of hoes in your shoes

'Cause I'm on speed, I'm faster than most
And I can rock a party from coast to coast
When I'm on speed, I'm faster than most
And I can rock a party from coast to coast
When I'm on speed, I'm faster than most
And I can rock a party from coast to coast
When I'm on speed, I'm faster than most
