Let's take it to the stage, sucker

It's the E and I'm smokin', wild like Tone Loc
I'm roastin', bakin' MCs, the E, I'm not jokin'
So back up, punk, slack up
Watch your weak posse before they get smacked up
One by one, two by two, three by three
Yo, P (What's up, E.D.?)
Pass the Uzis to blow up any wack MC that show up
There goes one, blast him now (E, hold up)
Don't make me wait
Because it might be too late, the punk might escape
And buck wild, and in fact, bite my style
And I'ma catch a bullshit charge plus trial
It's my thing to swing, your first mistake to bring
A duck MC that can't hang
Don't forget, I'm crazy swift
My name is Erick Sermon (Yeah, and I'm Parrish Smith)
I could act foolish, start blastin'
Haha, haha, now who's laughin'?
I'ma let you slide, but you owe me
Next time you see me (Holla like ya know me)
I'm mad

My life story I tell straight from the heart
When suckers tried to crash my shit straight from start
A young black kid destined for success
No Olde Gold, no cocaine, or buddha sess
Straight-up hard work, no sleep and no shorts
Brainstormin' with the skills that pop duke taught
To keep swingin', yeah, and not to quit
Now I ride the Benz, you ride the dick
With your punk friends, straight up pussy from punk city
That's why my attitude's fucked up and real shitty
From the backstabbers, yeah, my so-called friends
Who swim in my pool, when it's time flex the Benz
Around town, windows down as the sound pounds
Cool J tape or K-Solo's "Spellbound"
With fly girlies tippin', brothers grippin' and sippin'
Olde Gold, Red Bull, hands on my dick and
I'm just lampin' with my EK shades
Truck jewels, obviously the man's paid
But of course not, brother can't get his props
Like for instance, when I cruise up the block
In my 560, lampin' on my Metro phone
Chrome kit beamin' all off your dome
And like a sucker, yeah, you looked the other way
That's when I know you're on my dick, kid, but it's okay
It's normal, relax, your whole head's busted
Caught in the rap skit and couldn't be trusted
'Cause my sounds pound from here to Okinaw-y
Peace, and I'm Audi

Here's a little story I've got to tell, got, got to tell

Stay tuned to this last episode
When I rock the house and the mic explode
This is not the buckwild style that I be usin'
In fact, black, it causes (Mass confusion)
It's a fallout when sucker MCs and crowds call out
My name, oh, what a shame I got (Fame)

I'm not a new jack, my rhymes are not wack, and in fact
I'm like Clint Eastwood, 'stead of bullets, rhymes I pack
In my flow gun, so son, you better run
'Cause when it comes to hostage and prisoners, we take none
We move wax like kilos
And when my jam hits the streets, the sounds explode
Watch the right hook, duck the death blow, jack
I wonder where the E and the P's at
(Can they do it again?), you bet your ass, black
(See you in '91), until then, get the bozack (I'm mad)
Here's a little story I've got to tell, got to tell
