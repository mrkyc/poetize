You might also like We went out that night
 To a club downtown
 That was very high class
 And had boomin sounds
 We went in
 And we were dressed to impress
 Fly women and girlies
 Lookin their very best
 We took a seat at the bar
 Feelin brand new
 Frank ordered drinks, no liquor
 Just plain old brew
 He finished it
 Then he ordered one more
 And another
 And another
 And that made four
 He seen this fly girlie
 Suave and debonaire
 Light skinned complexion
 With long black hair
 But this girl was ug-ly
 I mean her body was through
 But after four drinks or more
 She looked like Paula Abdul
You know what baby?  You startin to look good
You startin to look REAL good
You startin to remind me of that superstar - Paula Abdul
 The party was over
 It was time to go
 You insisted on drivin
 When we said no

Nah guys, y'know?  I can drive myself home man
That ain't gonna be no problem
I drive better when I feel nice (P: Are you sure man?)
Are you kidding me man?
That stuff in there, that stuff in there taste like fruit punch
I could drink that all night
 So you got in your car
 Swervin on the road
 There was a cop in the bushes
 On radar patrol
 The light turned green
 And you decided to stop
 It turned red
 You took off
 And got pulled over by a cop
Chorus: repeat 4X
 You overdid it holmes
 You had too much to drink
* police siren sound *

Ah excuse me, can I see your license and registration please?
I don't have my license registration right NOW
But if you give me a chance, I can go home and get it
Oh what are you a wiseguy son?
No I don't mean to be a wiseguy officer
The honest truth, what really happened is
I just came from a plane from Dominican Republic
By the time I got to Motor Vehicle, Motor Vehicle was closed
Oh it was closed?
Yeah it was closed
Oh what's your name son?
My name is Frankie Nato, but my friends, they call me Frank B
How bout you officer - whatchu call yourself?
Oh this guy's a real wiseguy
Who's the young lady in the passenger seat?
You don't know who that is?  That's a superstar
Paula Abdul, say hi Paula
Oh yeah that's Paula Abdul?
Have you been drinkin son?
Oh no I don't drink man, the only thing I drink is fruit punch
OK son you wanna turn your car off
And leave the keys in the ignition and come with me please?
Where we goin officer?
I want you to come sit in the backseat
And blow in this tube for me please
Wait a minute, I ain't no faggot
I never blow anything in my life, and don't plan to
How bout you officer - you blowin anything?
Just blow into the tube son
Okay okay man * blows into the tube *
Oh what's this man?  Two point oh?
Oh Guns'n'Roses dude!
You might as well get ?
Cause you goin downtown sonny, you're drunk!
So whatchu tryin to tell me officer?
You tryin to tell me that that machine, tell me I'm drunk man?
Somethin wrong with that machine
That machine need a good fixin man
That's what I think officer
No you know what I think son?
I think you need a good lawyer
Let me tell you officer, I have a lawyer
My lawyer is so good, SO SO good
And by the time he's finished witchu, you gonna be workin in Alaska
So dress warm, as a matter of fact
I suggest you go out and buy yourself a sheepdog
Cause it gets BITTERLY cold out there

 Have you ever been coolin
 On a Friday night
 Wit your friends gettin wasted
 Just feelin nice
 You continued to drink
 When you know you should stop
 The next thing you know
 Your behind is caught
 Your body gets numb
 So you slow up the pace
 Your mouth gets watery
 And you can't feel your face
 You finally make it home
 And the fun begins
 You try to pass out
 But here comes the spins
 So you turn and toss
 Then you toss and turn
 Your head gets light
 And your chest starts to burn
 So you lay on your stomach
 And you tuck in your chin
 Pail by your bedside
 Now the breathing begins

Oh, oh God, just let me get through this last one
If you let me make it
If you let me make it through the night God
I promise I'll never have another drink again
I'll never drink again, as long as I live
* pukes several times *
Chorus

You overdid it
Hey yo this is EPMD tellin you not to drink and drive
Cause ain't nuttin' cool about chillin' in a coffin six feet under
YouknowwhatI'msayin?

Yo, this is Frank B
And learn from others mistakes holmes!

And don't let peer pressure get to you
Cause it costs you, or your life, or somebody else's life
In the long run

And it's like that
And if you don't believe you can get the bozack

See-ya!
