Yeah (Uh, uh), Erick Sermon (Uh), PMD (Hahaha)
Yeah, check it (Check it), M.O.P. (M.O.P.)
Erick and Parrish, Millenium Ducats
Hold me down (Hold me down), uh, yo

I grab the mic and grip it hard like it's my last time to shine
I want the chrome and the cream so I put it down for mine
Ill cat, slick talk, slang New York
To break it down to straight English, what the fuck you want?
Remember me, you punk faggot crab emcee?
Get your shit broke in half for fuckin' around with P
Ayo, strike two, my style Brooklyn like the Zoo
Hey you (Look, nigga), one more strike you through
Word is bi-dond, rock Esco, FUBU, and Phat Fi-darm
Every time I get my spit on, no doubt, I spark the gridiron
Step up and bless the track and spit a jewel
We keeps cool, no need for static, I strap tools

Next up, yo I believe that's me
Yo, get on the mic and rock the symphony (Yo, P)

Time to rock, the sound I got, it rings hot
Make your neck snap back like a slingshot
E hustle, I muscle my way in
Then tussle for days in, on my own with guns blazin'
Not for the fun of it, just for those who want me to run it
Then leave them like, "Who done it?"
Sucka duck, I do what I feel right now
When I spit the illest shit, cats be like, "Wow!"
Yo, I get looks when I'm in the place
That's that nigga, makin' you smile with Scarface
Uh, it ain't my fault that my style slick enough to shock ya
Hit you with the fifth, block-a block-a
If I get caught you can bet I'll blow trial
Be downtown swingin' M.O.P. style
You might also like
Next up, yo, I believe that's me
Yo (Danze) get on the mic and rock the Symphony

Say hello to the devil's advocate, whenever tragic hit
It's E, M.O.-PMD blastin' shit
Put in work in this cold game
Soldier (Soldier), I use work as code name
Told ya, line 'em up like it's Soul Train (Brrah)
And I give em the whole thing
My family has been trained to swat 'em if they plastic
Hit 'em and make 'em do a semi-backflip
(Bad shit) I'm donatin' a casket
We have raised hell in midtown and got down in traffic
(Tell 'em what you sayin)
Get the bozack before I tear your maggot ass flat
(Boom-boom) They're back

Next up, yo I believe that's me (Fame)
Get on the mic for the Symphony

Presentin' the real, straight from B'Ville
Motherfuckers don't like Fame 'cause I'm not cream filled
I feel what I speak so I speak what I feel
Sleep and I will creep and I kill
Motherfuck (Who know?) Jump out a Yugo
Open up your back with a MAC-uno-uno
Ghetto-bound nigga, I break all laws
Drink brews, curse out bitches and piss on walls
This rap game is a street game now, the game switched
Rappers are gettin' killed now with the same shit
I ain't no motherfuckin' role model
Kids don't follow 'cause I'ma hit this bitch full throttle
The type to write "Fuck 5-0" in your lobby
Rap is my religion, gear bikes is a hobby
Show love when you meet us, it's love when you greet us
Or the First Family will come see you with the heaters
