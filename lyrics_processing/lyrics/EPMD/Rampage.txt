Yeah, uh, funk, record mode (Yeah)
Slow down, baby (Uh)
Slow down, baby (Uh)
Slow down, baby (Yeah, uh)
Slow down, baby (Yeah)
LL Cool J in the house, you know what I'm sayin'? (Slow down, baby)
EPMD in effect, snappin' necks, cashin' large checks (Slow down, baby)
All the non-believers can cold get the dick, you know what I'm sayin'? (Slow down, baby)
'Cause this the daddy mack, king of the bozack
All my friends knows that (Slow down, baby)
Mixed and mastered down to the all that (Slow down, baby)
As I kick it like this (Slow down, baby)
(Slow down, baby)

'Cause we can get rugged, tough, hard like P
Tried to play my man, but you couldn't touch me
You faggot, no comp' rapper on a quest
To get your head flown, boy, you must be loccin' sess
'Cause many often wonder is MD paid?
You're goddamn right, punk, stay outta my way
'Cause I clock G's while you clock Z's
And I don't smoke crack, I smoke MCs
So pick up a pen, cop a squat, and take note
While rappers suffer from bleedin', sprains, and slit throats
'Cause my style deadly, psychopath, schizophrenic
A rapper choke like a carburetor, freeze up and panic
'Cause I clock pesos, don't sell yayo
'Nother word for cocaine, mi amigo
That's Spanish, terminology for friend
Now sit back and ride my bozack as I send
Bass funk with beats that thump
For kickers and amps cold lined up in my trunk
My system's crankin', my headlights are blinkin'
Brothers ridin' my tip, L, and at the same time thinkin', damn
How could a brother be so nice?
'Cause I'm the capital P-E twice, M-D-E twice
I choose to squeeze, some choose to fight
I like to write, but then again some bite
And while you was bangin' on tables
I was bangin' Snow White, P

Yeah, slow down, baby (Yeah)
Slow down, baby (Uh, yeah)
Slow down, baby
Uh, slow down, baby

The Ripper, the master, the overlordian
Playing MCs like an old accordion
I get the inspiration from unnecessary station
Them sayin' I was vacationin'
You can't quote with your weaker throats
Tryin' to sneak a peek at how I freak the notes
Major MCs become minor B-flats
So retire the mic, get your chains and your bats
Here's your chance to advance, get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
Pure entertainment, tonight's your arraignment
You're guilty, face down on the pavement
No holds barred, it's time to get scarred
You and your squad better praise the real god
The undertaker, droppin' thunder on fakers
When it comes to lyrics, I'm as freaky as Seka
So lay the mic down slow and careful
'Cause mine is fully loaded and I got another handful
A clip to slip in and start rippin'
Divin' and dippin' and givin' punks a whippin' (Aw, shit)
Just in case you wanna go a few rounds or so
I'm down so that you clowns'll know
Me gettin' burnt or hurt won't be tolerated
I got rhymes up the, huh, forget it, I'm constipated, L
Slow down, baby (Uh, yeah)
Slow down, baby (Yeah)
Slow down, baby
E Double in the house (Yeah)

When I come around, homeboy, watch your nuggets
A master on the beatdown, my style's rugged
When I attack the microphone, close the zone
Rap sees danger, can't roam
Security's packed in, wall-to-wall, can't fall
My rap tank is full, so I can't stall
My microphone is filled with premium
Any wack MC that flexes, I'm creamin' him
Not with lotion, bust the motion
Flotation when I rock on the mic, I'm like coastin'
I'm unique, fatigued
At my peak, you still seek
A style, 'cause yours extra weak
New method to rip the stage at my age
And get loose and kick like Bruce in a rage
I'm on a rampage

Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
