When I came out with my first rap jam
I had no idea that the record would slam
It did real good without radio play
Maybe at night, but no airplay in the day
I couldn't understand why to be exact
Our music was good and I was far from wack
Then came the answer, commercial was the key
To get airplay and a spot on TV
Like Ed Lover and Doctor Dre for Yo! MTV Raps
A show mainly for the Black
And still we can't ill, 'cause to them, that's wrong
'Cause like P.E. said, we're too Black and too strong
But hey, what can I say?
(Brothers and sisters), that's a price a rapper must pay, 'cause

As airwaves collapse, rap shows at a standstill
Some waves short-circuit the frequencies, can't handle
The funk tracks produced by EPMD
But it's a fat chance that we'll ever win a Grammy
Unless we sell out and kill the Black movement dead
Which means swallow our pride and become flunkies instead
And stop the rap about freedom, thoughts of a Black president
And rap about a Black cracked-up mayor in our residence
Give me a break, brothers, it's time to take a stand
And kill that no, sir, yes, sir, and thank you, ma'am
'Cause the word if's a luxury a Black man can't afford
That's why poverty is on the rise and we're still ignored
And it's a setback and yet the clock still ticks
And if we let it, rap would be run by politics
I read it somewhere that every man's created equal
But not in this day and age, maybe in the sequel
Which means next time, so observe these rhymes
And take a stand and go for yours, 'cause I'm going for mine
That's why I

Why is that when wrong is done by the Black
It's blown out of proportion and immediately attacked?
By the press and yes, conflict is caused
By the kids at concerts who bumrush the doors
One child gets hurt, the press gets pesty
But what about the Beatles, G, and Elvis Presley?
Same stuff was rough, rap does not cause violence
So (Fight the power), and make them understand
But too much power and you might get banned
So if you want airplay
You can't be too Black and hey, watch what you say, but ayy, yo
