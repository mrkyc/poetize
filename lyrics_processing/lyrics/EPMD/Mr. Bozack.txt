Good morning Mr. Bozack, time to wake up the nuts
For what? To hit the shower, so I can wash the butt
Damn, last night was crazy, word life, I had a blast
It was ass for days, nuts had a full tank of gas
Golly, G, word P, tits and VD
Pussy kicking louder than my Alpine Benzi, box
Yes, I fresh, sweet like gumdrops
Pay me like Oprah and no one to cockblock
Slow down big fella, why? I think you're gassin' me
P, get off my big dick, chill, stop harassing me
Your dick? You mean my dick, and don't forget
Now let me scrub that head before it smells like fish
Mr. Bozack
Mr. Bozack

That's your fault, black (Explain), no jim hat
You got in some fly shit and stuck me in bareback
Smarty, what happened over there at the party?
Was it Vodka and smeared on a bit of Bacardi?
No, dick (Don't call me that), sorry, Mr. Bozack
But you didn't help, talking' bout, "Where's the hoes at?"
I was hard (How hard?), hard enough to buck
Shit, you didn't rush the pussy, see, I stuffed her like a duck
Mr. Bozack, what? You went out like a sucker
Not me, G, P, 'cause you the one who bucked her
Hachoo, God bless you, damn, here's a tissue
Yo, P I'm feeling sick, relax, what can I get you?
Tetracycline? No, a penicillin cap, it burns
Yo, chill, Mr. Bozack
No, I can't believe that, cool, jack, screw that
All you had to do was wear a jim hat
I reached for one, but didn't quite make it
She grabbed on your headpiece, I couldn't quite take it
Now lounge Mr. Bozack, stop cryin' like a wuss
And bone up the nuts, G, 'cause yo, there's more puss
Look, P, the B-O-Z is like outtie
Outtie like who? Motherfuckin' Curt Gowdy

It's the jim
Ow, it burns
Don't worry, G, I'll have you hooked up on Friday
We go get this shot real quick
Everything gon' be copacetic
