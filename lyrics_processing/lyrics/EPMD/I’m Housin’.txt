Coolin' on the scene like a horse in a stable
A brother got ill and tried to snatch a fat cable
I stepped back, like it wasn't no thing
Punched him in the jaw with the fat gold ring
I had an ace in the hole when it came to that
(Yo P you was packin'?) You know I'm strapped
Posse kept rollin' it was hard to get with 'em
So I stepped back, and unbuttoned my Lee denim
They kept coming, just like I figured
So I stepped back, and started sprayin' niggas

What a way to go out, out like a sucker
But I'm on track, like a Long Island train conductor
That can head on a mission, suckers who be dissing
Always on my jock like a snake always hissing
Grabbing and tapping me like Luther Vandross
Take me to the bar for the drink and make a toast
Givin' best wishes to the best MC
The E the D-O-U-B-L-E
Because I'm housin'

Coolin at a party, no better yet disco
Head feelin mellow from a bottle of Cisco
Move
To crush and fry a sucker MC like crisco
Every chance I get, I try to kill
That's one less sucker new jack, who tried to act ill
I keep the place jumpin' 'til the party's through
Whether it's disco, hardcore, or rhythm and blues
Take off your coat, won't you stay a while
Check out the voice that is smooth and mild
It's like Wheel of Fortune, go on for big money
Come cold rock the party, and leave with your honey
You might also like
Gimme the cue, check one two
Don't try to come off on me, because you doo-doo
Treatin me the E Doubl-E, like a stepchild
Well let me tell you homeboy you're livin' foul
MCs, you know who you are
(On the bandwagon) Why P? (Cause you a star)
This is the year that when the joker's are wild
When a fag can't hack it and try to bite the style
I get hip to the scheme, before it happens
If it gets wild, then I start cappin'
But for now, since everything's calm
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
As I proceed to rock, the girls are clockin'
Some brothers act hard but the rest are jockin'
Because I'm housin'

I come on strong, like a bodybuilder
Cast a spell upon a sucker, like witch Matilda
Deliver a rhyme like Federal Express
My intention's not to dis, but impress
For ladies and gents, who money was spent
To see the E-P-Double-E-M-D (yes the main event)
In concert... not worried bout oohs and boos (because we do work)
To make your body jerk
(To make your girl want to leave her man and start to flirt
With the P) Double-E MD Double E'n
I'm not skeezing, but pleasing
All party goers, also behind show-ers
Who like the not, fast slow flow of rhymes that form in my dome
Out the mouth, to the microphone
