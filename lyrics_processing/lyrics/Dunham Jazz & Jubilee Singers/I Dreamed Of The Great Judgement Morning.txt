I would not have believed I'd see it
Untill the end of time
I'm prayin' my Lord might call me
And I wouldn't be ready to die
Now if I was a sinner
I'd tell you what I would do
I'd lay upside my people
And wait till the kingdom come

And, oh, what a weeping and wailing
As the lost were told of their fate;
They cried for the rocks and the mountains
Though they prayed, but their prayer was too late
And, oh, what a weeping and wailing
As the lost were told of their fate;
They cried for the rocks and the mountains
Though they prayed, but their prayer was too late

And I dreamed that the great judgment morning
Had dawned, and the trumpet had blown;
I dreamed that the nations had gathered
To judgment before the white throne;
From the throne came a bright, shining angel
And he stood on the land and the sea
And he swore with his hand raised to Heaven
That time was no longer to be
You might also like
And, oh, what a weeping and wailing
As the lost were told of their fate;
They cried for the rocks and the mountains
Though they prayed, but their prayer was too late

The widow was there with the orphans
God heard and remembered their cries;
No sorrow in heaven forever
God wiped all the tears from their eyes;
The gambler was there and the drunkard
And the man that had sold them the drink
With the people who gave him the license
Together in hell they did sink

And, oh, what a weeping and wailing
As the lost were told of their fate;
They cried for the rocks and the mountains
Though they prayed, but their prayer was too late
And, oh, what a weeping and wailing
As the lost were told of their fate;
They tried for the rocks and the mountains
