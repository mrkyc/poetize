Just works out that way
I like drinkin' with him I like talkin' to her
I got a million things to say
And if you think I'm a little crazy darlin'
You oughta know
Ever full moon the ghost of Hank Williams calls me up and sings me a song
He said now every mother's daughter
Needs a stone back man
To make the records jump off the wall
And every time I hear it I play to go
With a-wop-bop-loo-bam-boom all night long
Well I was Interstate rollin' one dark night
It was scary with my radio on
When from my back seat there came a bluesy beat
And a voice that could chill the bone
I checked my rearview mirror, looked into his eyes
I saw the light
It was the ghost of Hank Williams, pickin' and a-grinnin'
He gave me some good advice
He told me every mother's daughter
Needs a stone back man
To make the records jump off the wall
And every time I hear it I play to go

Yeah all night long
Aah break my heart...
Well the next time I seen him I was chewin' up doors
On a top down dirty blonde
She had her liquor stick down(?) her hair was a wreck
I knew she was ready for fun
When she said now come on over honey I got what it takes
I saw the light
Then the ghost of Hank Williams taps me on the shoulder
And gave me this good advice
He said now every mother's daughter
Needs a stone back man
To make the records jump off the wall
And every time I hear it I play to go
With a-wop-bop-loo-bam-boom.... all night long
All night long
All night long
All night long
All night long
All night long
