All I wanna do is spend a little time with you
But you're so young, it's obscene
I'll just keep biding my time till you put your little hand in mine
Boy, I can't wait for the day when you finally turn sixteen

There are so many rats on a sinking ship
There's so much of you, I can't wait
To get your grips when your halo slips
Ow

"How dare you call this love?"
Ooh, that's what they say, it's that urge I've got to fight
"How dare you call this love
When it flies in the face of all that is good and is right?" Yeah

You've got it all, and you're always my first port of call
This is the happiest I've ever been
And I know I should wait, but you lay it all out on a plate
And I'm just too fond of you, boy, to let the laws of nature intervene

There are so many rats on a sinking ship
There's so much of you, I can't wait
To get your grips when your halo slips
