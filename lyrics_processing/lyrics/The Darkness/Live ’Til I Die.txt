I was born out of wedlock on the seventeenth day
Of the third month of '75
I watched my daddy working every hour God sends
Just to keep all of my dreams alive
I was the eldest of three, the pressure never got to me
I guess I had a vision of how everybody should be
Thinking not of what they'll miss
Until we're standing at the edge of the abyss

Live 'til I die
And laugh 'til I cry
Live 'til I die
And laugh 'til I cry

'Cause I know what I'm looking for
I won't listen any more
Any more

Well, I went through some changes at the age of fourteen
And discovered all the joys of rock wear
I made a point of wearing unfeasibly tight jeans
And endeavoured just to grow my hair
But kids can be cruel, I wasn't popular at school
I became the subject of a campaign of ridicule
But I'll stick by my guns
And rise above the laughter of the ignorant ones

Live 'til I die
And laugh 'til I cry
Live 'til I die
And laugh 'til I cry

'Cause I know what I'm looking for
I won't listen any more
Any more

And the soundest advice I ever heard a man give
Was daddy on the subject of the way I want to live
"If that's the path you wish to tread
Put all your clothes back on and take it off of your head
'Cause I'll always be here and if you freeze, I'll talk you down
You don't have to feel obliged to act the high school clown
I know you've got what it takes
And if you want to, you can learn from your mistakes"

Live 'til you die
Laugh 'til you cry
Live 'til you die
