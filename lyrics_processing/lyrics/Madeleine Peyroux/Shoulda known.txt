In a Lousiana Bayou by the light of the moon
By the bank of a river, on an old dead log
Sat a shiny black scorpion and a big green frog
Now the water was deep and the river was wide
And the Scorpion had commitments on the opposite side
She said Hey Mr Froggy I'd be mighty obliged
If I could hop on your back and you could give me a ride
Shoulda known
Shoulda known
Well my friends oh, see me crying
And all they can say is shoulda known
Well the frog said I'd love to but there's just one thing
You got a bad reputation for a terrible sting
If I take you cross the River like you're askin me to
How do I know you won't sting me when the journey is through
The scorpion said "Man don't believe the hype Don't you fall for that tired old stereotype"
"If you do me this favor and deliver me there
I will tell you a little secret only scorpions share"
Shoulda known
Shoulda known
Well my friends oh see me crying
And all they can say is
Shoulda known
So our friends started out across the perilous flood
And the scorpion weighed more than the frog thought she would
But the froggy was strong and he knew he'd prevail
Til he felt the deadly point of that scorpions tail
So the water swept over the unfortunate pair
And the froggy cried out with the last of his air
He said "Why did you do it?, now you're goin' down too!"
Said the Scorpion "it's my nature, that's what scorpions do"
You shoulda known
You shoulda known
Well my friends oh see me crying
And all they can say is
You shoulda known, alright !
Well I met her downtown in a bleecker street bar
Serenading some drunks for the tips in a jar
Well I knew her reputation from the old grapevine
But she sounded so sweet and she looked so fine
Well she shot me a smile and she bought me a beer
And she told the saddest story that you ever will hear
My judgement dissolved in a bottle wine
I was reading her lips and she was reading my mind
Shoulda known
I shoulda known
Well my friends oh see me crying
And all they can say is
Shoulda known
If the end of the story isn't perfectly plain
Know that Happy ever after ain't the final refrain
But my time's getting short and the story is long
But suffice it to say, you find me singin this song
Shoulda known
I shoulda known
Well my friends oh see me crying
And all they can say is
Shoulda known
Well my friends oh see me crying
And all they can say is
