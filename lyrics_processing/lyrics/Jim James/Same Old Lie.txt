It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie

It's the same old lie they tell you when you're little
Try to make you forget just what it is you're really made of
And follow on just like most everyone
But you and me, we ain't like most everyone
Pure individual, bright as the shining sun
And sure as hell we know where it is we come from
And where it is, yeah, we probably going back to it
But now we gonna live a little, try and get a little truth

It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie

It's the same old lie you been readin' 'bout
Bleedin' out, now who's getting cheated out?
You best believe it's the silent majority
If you don't vote it's on you not me
It's the same old lie, told from the dawn of time
Yeah, stretch it out a little, try to milk every last dime
Hate crimes, shelter lines
They try to take what's yours and mine
Is there any peace to be found in a lifetime?

It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie

It's the same old lie, you gotta live with it
Or if you got sense then you better try changing it
But nothing is more difficult than changing what's been comfortable
We've seen it tried a million times
It's hard to think when hypnotized
A lie's a lie, it destroys from the inside
Decays the teeth from behind that false smile
A lie's a lie and I've told my share
But I know I'm gonna suffer for the shit I put out there

It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie

When it's the same old lie I think I died a little
Gun drawn, faces long, how much killing can be done?
It's the same old lie they tell you when you die
There are mansions up in heaven
Fifty virgins off in the sky
When you can't trade today for some far off promise of tomorrow
Can't build love out of guns, blood, and sorrow
They say we can't live together but we know that's a lie
'Cause we know it in our heart we can make it if we try
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same old lie
