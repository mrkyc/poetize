Did you think you could hide in plain sight
Life goes on with or without you
But I hope you know I still care about you
I know you think we're all out here on our own
But you don't have to go this alone
You don't stop you don't go you ain't right
Did you think you could hide in plain sight
Looked up and the heavens opened
Does it really all have to wind up as nothing
Look down at the ground
Life's eternal struggle
It's just a dream
Oh I hate to burst your bubble
Times change
Entire lives reduced to rubble
Stars shooting down in all their hope and glory
Fools march on the Earth lost in the forest
But then what if the world became sweet again
Hand in hand everybody all best of friends
Golden ends
Could we handle it
You don't know you can't see it ain't right
Did you think you could hide in plain sight
Life goes on with or without you
But I hope you know I still care about you
You might also likeI know you think we're all out here on our own
But you don't have to go this alone
You don't stop you don't go you ain't right
Did you think you could hide in plain sight
Out on my own
Ain't nobody watching
Now it happens is on my own watching
The  rumination, the world we understand
The world we understand
But if you do own please take my hand
I'll follow you until the end of the earth
To realize, to realize in silent rebirth
Me and this reflex
Where does it come from
Some have to lose it all
Do you wanna live again
To just sing again
?
You don't know you can't see it ain't right
Did you think you could hide in plain sight
Life goes on with or without you
But I hope you know I still care about you
I know you think we're all out here on our own
But you don't have to go this alone
You don't stop you don't go you ain't right
