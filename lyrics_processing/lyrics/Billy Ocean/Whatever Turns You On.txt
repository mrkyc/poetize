You gotta make your mind up from the start
Don't hesitate
You gotta move before it gets too late
(bridge)
There'll be times
Down the line, when you might go astray
If you find
Peace of mind, don't let it slip away
(chorus)
Whatever turns you on - enjoy yourself
And do it while you can
Whatever turns you on - enjoy yourself
And do it while you can
Whatever turns you on - enjoy yourself
And do it while you can
OOh you gotta be yourself
(music break 5/4)
Reach for the stars
It doesn't really matter who you are
Never look down
You'll never stop the world from turnin' 'round
(bridge)
Come what may
Everyday, you gotta live your life
Everyday
Is the first day of the rest of your life
You might also like(chorus)
Whatever turns you on - enjoy yourself
And do it while you can
Whatever turns you on - enjoy yourself
And do it while you can
Whatever turns you on - enjoy yourself
And do it while you can
OOh you gotta be yourself
(instrumental 8/4)
(bridge)
Come what may
Everyday, you gotta live your life
Everyday
Is the first day of the rest of your life
Whatever turns you on - enjoy yourself
And do it while you can
Whatever turns you on - enjoy yourself
And do it while you can
Whatever turns you on - enjoy yourself
And do it while you can
(you gotta be yourself - yeah!)
Whatever turns you on - enjoy yourself
And do it while you can
Whatever turns you on - enjoy yourself
And do it while you can
Whatever turns you on - enjoy yourself
And do it while you can
(do that, do that, do that, do that, do it do it)
(you gotta be yourself)
Whatever turns you on - enjoy yourself
And do it while you can
