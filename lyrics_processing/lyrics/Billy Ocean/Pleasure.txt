I'm addicted to all that you can do
Oh baby
It's pleasure loving you
Some people push it to the limit
Some people live on the edge
But sooner or later
We all have to come back down
When there is a cloud on my horizon and
Pressure is up ahead
That's when I run to you
So good to have you around
Ooh baby
When I need a holiday
I need to get away with you
It's the pleasure that keeps me running back to you
I'm addicted to all of the things you do
You know how to please me through and through
It's just pleasure of loving you
Just loving you
That's all I wanna do
Too busy reaching for the glory
And reaching out for a star
Watch out for the danger
Sometimes we go too far
When the walls close in around me and
I can't take anymore
No matter the distance
I'll come to you
Where you are
Ooh baby
When I need a holiday
I need to get away with you

Oh no no no no
Because the love I've found is safe and sound with you
Ooh baby
When I need a holiday
I need to get away with you
It's the pleasure that keeps me running back to you
I'm addicted to all of the things you do
You know how to please me through and through
It's just pleasure of loving you

Cause I love the things you do
