Stop me if you've heard it all before, girl
Stop me, there'll be no more to say

Oh, I'd give you the world if the world was mine to give, mm-mm
Oh, I would hold you, dear, for as long as I live
Darling, you and I, oh, we could light up the world
Mm, an ordinary guy and a wonderful girl, yeah-eh

Richer, we can be richer than a millionaire, mm
We have everything money just couldn't buy
Oh, fancy diamond rings and a place in society
No, they don't mean a thing, so, my love, we'll get by
(We'll get by, we'll get by, we'll get by)

But stop me if you've heard it all before, girl
Stop me, all you've gotta do is say
If your love is still unsure, love
Then stop me, there'll be no more to say

There's no guarantee that we'll find a pot of gold, mm-mm
But who can ever tell where that rainbow will end?
Just put your trust in me and together, our love will grow, yeah
Darling, on my word, you can always depend
(Till the end, till the end, till the end)
You might also like
But stop me if you've heard it all before, girl
Stop me, all you've gotta do is say
If your love is still unsure, love
Then stop me, there'll be no more to say

Oh-oh, stop me if you've heard it all before, girl
Stop me, all you've gotta do is say
If your love is still unsure, love
Then stop me, there'll be no more to say

(Stop me) Oh
(You can stop me) Yeah-eh
There'll be no more to say
(Stop me) Oh
(You can stop me) Yeah-eh-eh
There'll be no more to say
(Stop me) Yeah
(You can stop me) Yeah-eh
There'll be no more to say
(Stop me) Yeah
(You can stop me) Yeah-eh
There'll be no more to say
(Stop me)
