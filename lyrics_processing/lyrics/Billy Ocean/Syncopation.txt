Syncopation
Oh, I miss that syncopation
I guess I'll never really understand
She gave no indication
That she was loving any other man
When she holds me
Her body does strange things to mine
When she loves me
Then I know she's one of a kind
She's really special
She knows what good love is all about
Ooh, yeah
She's got something
I don't want to live without
Ooh, yeah
I miss that syncopation
I guess I'll never really understand
She gave no indication
That she was loving any other man
I can't imagine
My baby with somebody new
Oh, no, no. I'm so confused
That I don't know what to do
You might also likeOoh, ee
I took love for granted
And now I'm left here all alone
Alone and crying
You're all I'm wanting
So girl won't you come back home?
Ooh, I miss that syncopation
I guess I'll never really understand
She gave no indication
That she was loving any other man
Ooh, I miss that syncopation
I guess I'll never really understand
She gave no indication
That she was loving any other man
You see I never had a lover
Who could make me over like this, like this
And there'll never be another
Who could take me over like this, like this
Ooh, how I miss that syncopation
Baby's found another
Baby's found another
She's found another lover
Ooh my baby
Woo
Ooh, how I miss that syncopation
Baby's found another
Baby's found another
She's found another lover
Ooh my baby
Woo
Ooh, I miss that syncopation
I guess I'll never really understand
She gave no indication
That she was loving any other man
