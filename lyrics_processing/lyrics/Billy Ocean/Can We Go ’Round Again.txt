Can we go 'round again? (Can we go 'round?)
I know that we can make it happen
This is too good to end (Can we go 'round?)
We've gotta do it for the children
Can we go 'round again?
Let's spread our love around the world
Can we go 'round again? (Oh my, my, my, my, my, my)
Talking to every boy and girl

I have a dream
We can be more than friends one day
Just like a brothers, if you let nothing stand in the way
It's not hard as it may seem
To hear the sound of children playing
And you imagine what I'm saying

Why oh why (Why oh why)
Can't it be like we want it to be (Want it to be)
Between you and me, whoa

Can we go 'round again? (Can we go 'round?)
I know that we can make it happen (Oh yeah)
This is too good to end (Too good to end)
We've gotta do it for the children (Oh)
Can we go 'round again? (Can we go 'round?)
Let's spread our love around the world (All around the world)
Can we go 'round again? (Ooh-hoo)
Talking to every boy and girl

If we could only choose
We could begin to live again
Look to the futures
There could be laughter with our pain
There's nothing left to lose
There must be something we can do
Isn't it time for something new?

There's a way (There's a way)
Who's to say?
Do we give it a try? (Give it a try)
Don't let it die (Don't let it die), whoa
