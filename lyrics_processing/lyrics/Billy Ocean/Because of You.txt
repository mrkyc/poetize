You give me such inspiration
Day by day, you are my reason to smile
And I know that come what may
It's great world anyway
Heart to heart, we can face any test
Could it be together, we're the best
No matter what they say
It's a great world anyway

Oh, it's because of you, I can face it all
Even though my back's against the wall
In times of uncertainty, you were there for me
To guide me on and take me to the limit with love

They all say it could never last
We'll prove them wrong like we did in the past
No matter what they say
It's a great world anyway
(I need you in my life)
I'll do anything (to keep you in my life)
Straight from my heart, I've got so much to give
All tied up with a ribbon of love, oh, oh
You might also like
Oh, because of you, I can face it all
Even though my back's against the wall
In times of uncertainty, you were there for me
To guide me on and take me to the limit with love

Love is a river so free
Promise you won't stop the flow
Oh, 'cause sometimes I sit down and wonder
Where would I be without you in my life

Oh it's because of you, I can face it all
Even though my back's against the wall
In times of uncertainty, you were there for me
To guide me on and take me to the limit, whoa-whoa
(Because of you) Oh, oh baby
Oh, in times of uncertainty, you were there for me
To guide me on and take me to the limit, oh-oh, oh

(Because of you)
You take me there, baby
(Because of you)
In the heat of the night
(Because of you)
When I need some comfort
(Because of you)
You're always there
(Because of you)
To shelter me from harm
(Because of you)
Because of you, baby
(Because of you)
Oh, I, I
(Because of you)
Can you see my tears
(Because of you)
Feel it on my pillow
(Because of you)
Because of you, baby
(Because of you)
I know, I know it's because of you, baby
(Because of you)
