No, no, no, no
(Red light) You took my heart and turned me on
(Spells danger) And now the danger sign is on
(Can't hold out) Never thought the day would come
(Much longer) When I would feel alone without you
('Cause red light) And now I'm like a child again
(Means warning) Calling out his mama's name
(Can't hold out) You got me on a ball and chain
(I'm burning) Doin' things that I don't wanna (Baby, baby)
I can't stop running to you
I feel love coming through you
And, girl, with you beside me
Hold on, heaven guide me
Red light, feel the red light (Spells danger)
Oh, it's a danger warning
Can't hold out, can't hold out (Much longer), no, no, no!
