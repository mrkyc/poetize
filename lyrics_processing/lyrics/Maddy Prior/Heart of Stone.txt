All the way from the days of innocence
About the way things were and the way things are
How a new life starts when an old life ends
With the promise of a new experience
And how the strangest things
Become our guiding stars
Mostly re-runs of old movies we've seen
Half a lifetime vanished
Could have been a dream
What you gonna do about this heart of stone?
It twists your mind and bends your bones
What you gonna do about this battle heart of stone?
I said goodbye, I really had to fly
Should have been on my way some time ago
To set the world a right and to make my mark
How i keep a straight face with a smile in place
Cos I really don't want to let it show
That I fear failure like a demon in the dark
Always searching for perfection
Always searching for a voice to call my own

It twists your mind and bends your bones
What you gonna do when you're all alone at night?
How you gonna make this old friend sing?
How you gonna fix his damaged wings?
What you gonna do about this bad old heart of stone?
I was cruising in a clapped out care-worn carriage
By the crumbling stones of Hadrian
Passing monuments to passing men
Heading for a frontier down in time
On the borders of a new millenium
Weighing my prospects on a scale of 10
Leisure and luxury they've never been so high
Pride and prejudice, they reach right to the sky
What you gonna do about this heart of stone?
It twists your mind and bends your bones
What you gonna do when you're all alone at night?
How you gonna make this old friend sing?
How you gonna fix his damaged wings?
