"The king's daughter goes with child," among the ladies all
And they'll never go down to the broom anymore
It's whispered by the ladies one unto the other
The broom blooms bonny, the broom blooms fair
"The king's daughter goes with child, unto her own brother"
And they'll never go down to the broom anymore
He's ta'en his sister down to his father's deer park
The broom blooms bonny, the broom blooms fair
With a yew-tree bow and arrow slung fast across his back
And they'll never go down to the broom anymore
"And when that you hear me give a loud cry"
The broom blooms bonny, the broom blooms fair
"Shoot from your bow an arrow, and there let me lie"
And they'll never go down to the broom anymore
"And when that you see that I am lying dead"
The broom blooms bonny, the broom blooms fair
"Put me in a grave with the turf all at my head
And we'll never go down to the broom anymore"
And when he has heard her give a loud cry
The broom blooms bonny, the broom blooms fair
A silver arrow from his bow he suddenly let fly
And they'll never go down to the broom anymore
