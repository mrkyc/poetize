The grand governor of the federal reserve
Public enemy of the society
The one you cannot see
The 33 degree
Before you call the shot but now it's our turn
Blow up the system and the tables have turned
Your inner knowledge, you thought I'd never learn
I strike a match and make the whole place burn
I'm the real WMD
I'm your number one public enemy
I'm the one, your runaway slave
I'm the one, the one who got away
Automatic, rapid, fire
Automatic make me inna danger
Automatic, rapid, fire
Automatic make me in a danger
Lethal, make me lethal, I'm a weapon
Danger, make me danger
Danger make me danger AK-47
Lethal, make me lethal, I'm a weapon
Danger, make me danger
Danger make me danger AK-47
Danger make me danger

Shadows I creep 'cause I know exactly
The knowledge you keep
I'm the word on the street
I've got nothing to lose, the whole world to gain
Slipped outta your noose, I'm running your game
I beat the hive, I upset the swarm
Category five, I'm the centre of the storm
We not gonna stress
Put me to the test
I strike a match and make the whole place burn
Walk with the angels and me down with wind
Bulletproof vest and a smith and wesson
Anybody diss me I gonna teach them a lesson
Not gonna stress
Put me to the test
We not gonna stress
Put me to the test
Walk with the angels and me down with wind
Bulletproof vest and a smith and wesson
Anybody diss me I gonna teach them a lesson
Not gonna stress
Put me to the test
We not gonna stress
Put me to the test
Thirty three degree
