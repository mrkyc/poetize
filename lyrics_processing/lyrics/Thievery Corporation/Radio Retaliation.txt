Woooah now, retaliation
Singin' woooah now, we a go wake up the nation
Radio retaliation
It's such a different corporation
We takin' over your station And we a go change the vibration
People fi get up and pump them fist when Sleepy talk
Hear mi trasmission whether you drive or whether you walk
Put up me antenna inna the middle of the park
And transmit mi signal inna the light and inna the dark
Radio retaliate, and never ever get caught
And change the stereotype of people's washover thoughts
50,000 watts of Thievery hit them like poison darts
And watch the whole system what them build up fall apart
Singin' woooah now retaliation
Singin' woooah now, we a go wake up the nation
Radio retaliation
It's such a different corporation
We takin' over your station
And we a go change the vibration
Mi have the basic qualification just fi get people straight
And juggle the microphone from 8 o'clock back to 8
People give me the recommendation from the musical senate
See Thievery Corporation LiveGet tickets as low as $70You might also likeFi juggle the roundest sound, the mellowest sound, the sound with the most weight
Them stand up out of the corner inna the driveway, outta mi gate
To hear the chief rocker them a fling dubplate
All who want fi challenge Thievery, then its your time fi wait
And re-emerge from the scene, and wipe away all the hate
Radio retaliation, is such a different corporation
We takin' over your station
And we a go change the vibration
Chief rocker Thievery Corp them pon the attack
With melody and sophistication make you bound have to rock
Sleepy Wonder deh pon the mic, the ragga muffin speed rap
And if your vibes is inna the gutter, I will lift it up to the top
Eric and Rob them produce the beat, and invite Sleepy down fi chat
The combination of the crew, destroy your whole habitat
The main objection of the track is to tear the whole place flat
And have the people inna the lounge, them want to get up, and they are singin'
Woooah now retaliation
Singin' woooah now, we a go wake up the nation
Radio retaliation
It's such a different corporation
We takin' over your station
