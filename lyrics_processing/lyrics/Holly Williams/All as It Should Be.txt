Did your heart endure the truth
Will you fight to find the healing or will time heal all your wounds
Do you drown in your desire for a time you used to know
Memories can't touch you they are just a picture show
Dont let go, oh honey can't you see
Everythings a circle in itself
All as it should be
Have you stood inside a nightmare
Did it slap you in the face
Were you left to lose control
Did you ever find a way
Was it somebody that loved you or a face you've never seen
So final, so quick are the hands of destiny
Don't let go, honey can't you see
Everythings a circle in itself
All as it should be
You philosophize each second then you live as if you're dead
Always aching for the beauty of the visions in your head
Was it something that you wanted only never had the guts
Now you stand ashamed and regret your giving up
Where would you be, if you had tried
If you had given all you could...
To the passion of your life

Every struggle, all confusion, endless questions in your head
But he's got you where he wants you
There are reasons we can't see
We all stand where we belong
Every moment meant to be
So don't let go, honey can't you see
Everythings a circle in itself
All as it should be
All as it should be
All as it should be
All as it should be
I hope there's something in these words to reveal you before everything you hide
And if you never have believed maybe you will find the willingness to try
See everything lies in its place
