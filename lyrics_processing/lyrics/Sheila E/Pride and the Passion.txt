He was everything she was looking for
He had big cash and a Brando smile
He was pretty easy to adore
She tried her luck, huh
I mean she played the man
She sho'nuff thought she could turn him on
But she got stuck when he kissed her hand
And told her that he wanted to take her home
Pride and the passion
Laugh all night, cry all day
If true love is old-fashioned
Should we pass or should we play?
In a flash, her life had changed
(Life had changed)
Everything she feared was put on trial
(Everything was put on trial)
Priorities rearranged (Rearranged)
She said she had to have him for a little while
And if he's good, he can teach her things
(He can teach her things)
Things about herself that she never knew
And if he's the one, the shining armor knight
Think of all the dirty things they could do

Laugh all night, cry all day
'Cause if true love is old-fashioned
Should we pass or should we play?
What's it gonna be?
The pride or the passion, passion, passion?
In a flash, she took a chance
She let him take her to his crib
Music played, they started to dance
She said she really dug his ad-lib
What went down, I don't wanna say (I don't wanna say)
Destiny is yours, don't let it fool ya
And if you're wrong, expect a massive drag
If you're right, more power to ya
Pride and the passion
Laugh all night, cry all day
'Cause if true love is old-fashioned
Should we pass or should we play?
Pride and the passion
Laugh all night, cry all day
'Cause if true love is old-fashioned
Should we pass or should we play?
Pride
Pride and the passion
Pride and the passion, ooh
The pride and the passion
