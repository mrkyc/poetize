Ooh, he looks better every time I see him
Look
Those eyes, those lips
I know he wants me
I know he does
I see him walkin'
His body talkin'
He's got a real cool style
Something that he got
It get me so hot
His body drive me wild
I know it's gonna be tough
Things I'm gonna have to give up
Yeah, I know he thinks he's sweet
But he can't resist my beat
I know he sees me
Why does he tease me?
Why does he play this game? Ha
He knows I love him
Always thinking of him
I guess pretty men have no shame
