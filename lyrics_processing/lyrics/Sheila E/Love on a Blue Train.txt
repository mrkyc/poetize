All aboard

On my way to nowhere
Lookin' for nothin', baby
I was blue
I saw you sittin' lonely
Thought I was the only, baby
You were too
Funny when our eyes met
The walls around me turned wet
This is fun
Alone in number 14
A trip with you is foreseen, baby
I will come

Take me on a trip
Kiss me on the lips
Love on a blue train, yeah
Locomotive rock me
Nothing's gonna stop me
Love blue train

The sweetest smell on this train
Is creepin' into my brain
I get high
With every city we pass
I want you baby mo' bad
My, oh, my
Go to cities unknown
I want it all full-blown
Take me there
Never mind the porter
We can hide it on the floor, baby
I don't care
You might also like

Locomotive rock me
Nothing's gonna stop me

Lookin' for nothin', baby

Locomotive rock me
Nothing's gonna stop me
