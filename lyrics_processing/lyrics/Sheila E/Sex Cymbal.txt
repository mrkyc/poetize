Psych!
Sex cymbal (Woof!)
Sex cymbal (Woof!)

There's a rumor 'bout "The Glamorous Life"
I think I told you once, I don't mind telling you twice
I'd like to be the one who's in your dreams
But not because I make lots of money and headed for the big screen
Heaven forbid, I don't end up like James Dean

You say your love will never stop
And I hope it's the truth
Not just 'cause I'm on top
No

They call me a sex cymbal, say I'm a star (Call me sex cymbal)
It's up to them just what you are
Sex cymbal (Woof!)
With pumps and Versace in my Jaguar (Pumps in my Jaguar)

If I was living 9-to-5
And hanging with the girls at the same old dive
Would everybody beg me to sign their jeans?
Or is it 'cause I'm what you call famous?
You might also like
I'm blessed with all the fortune and fame
If I didn't have a dime, would you treat me the same?
Tell the truth now

They call me a sex cymbal, say I'm a star (Call me sex cymbal)
It's up to them just what you are
Sex cymbal (Woof!)
With pumps and Versace in my Jaguar (Pumps in my Jaguar)

Realize it's an image before it goes too far
Show me, tell me, make me believe, you love me just for me
I think you've known me long enough, I'm Sheila, not Miss E
Come make me happy, I don't mean just the boys
Everybody in my house, come on, we got to make some noise

Heaven forbid
Sex cymbal (Woof!)
Just realize it's an image 'fore it goes too far

They call me a sex cymbal, say I'm a star (Call me sex cymbal)
It's up to them just what you are
Sex cymbal (Woof!)
With pumps and Versace in my Jaguar (Pumps in my Jaguar)
Just realize it's an image 'fore it goes too far
Call me a sex cymbal, call me a star
It's up to them just what you are
Sex cymbal (Woof!)
With pumps and Versace in my Jaguar
Just realize, it's an image, 'fore it goes too far
I know you like 'em cute and simple with no frame of mind
But I'm-a talk and body-shock and mesmerize you, every time
Pumps in my Jaguar
It's up to them just what you are
Goes too far
They call me a sex cymbal, say I'm a star
It's up to them just what you are
