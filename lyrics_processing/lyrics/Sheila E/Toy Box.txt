Sister's got a place she goes whenever she's lonely
It's so much fun
Brother cries whenever he's lonely
And he's lonely 'cause he hasn't one
But that's cool 'cause...

Sister's got a place she goes whenever she's lonely
She's got a toy box
Love
It comes so easy when the children open doors
Doesn't matter who knocks

Sister's very kind so it's never quite a problem
When it comes to love
Everything's so easy when we're children
One touch is too much
Oooh

Sister's got a place she goes whenever she's lonely
She's got a toy box
Love it comes so easy when the children open doors
Doesn't matter who knocks

One touch
One touch
One touch is too much

Why we hide our feelings when we're older
Is a movie I don't want to see (I don't want to see)
Truth is all that matters in a month of Saturdays
When you're 17 (When you're 17)

Sister's got a place she goes whenever she's lonely
She's got a toy box
(She's got a toy box)
Love it comes so easy when the children open doors
(Knock, knock)
Doesn't matter who knocks
Sister's got a place she goes whenever she's lonely
She's got a toy box (Toy box)
Love it comes so easy when the children open doors
Doesn't matter who knocks
Sister's got a place she goes whenever she's lonely
She's got a toy box (Toy box)
Love comes so easy
She's got a toy box
One touch, one touch, one touch is too much
