The moon up above, it shines down upon our skin
Whispering words that scream of outrageous sin
We all want the stuff that's found in our wildest dreams
It gets kinda rough in the back of our limousine

That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre
That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre

A strawberry mind, a body that's built for two
A kiss on the spine, we do things we never do
Come swallow the pride and joy of the ivory tower
We'll dance on the roof, make love on a bed of flowers

That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre
That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre
