What you gonna do tonight?
Stay home and watch The Honeymooners?
Ah, girl, later for you
I'm gonna go to the Boy's Club
Let me tell you 'bout this club I know
They got all the men
All the dough
They really can't dance and they ain't too bright
But the girls don't mind if the money's right
Some are cute and some are not
But that don't matter 'cause the music's hot
Can't help dancin' when you feel the beat
You can't help watchin' 'cause you feel the heat
A girl with four legs, that's the best
You better look twice
There's someone under her dress
Boy's Club
Meet me later at the Boy's Club
Boy's Club
Meet me later at the Boy's Club
You might also likeYeah, you're kinda cute
But it's about the perfume
Confusion in your bathroom
Oh, yeah, he just asked me for a match
And I said
"Yeah, you're face and my shoes"
He said, "You just ruined my night"
And I said
"Yeah, just think
You could be at home
Watchin' "The Honeymooners"
Wanna dance?"
Light skinned boys think they're so bad
They drink Evian, listen to jazz
At home, they like symphonies
But when they're at the club
It's Sheila E (Sheila E.)
