Ladies and gents, turn up your sound systems
To the sound of Carlos Santana
And the G&B
It's the product of Ghetto Blues
From the Refugee Camp

Oh, Maria, Maria
She remind me of a West Side Story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She living the life just like a movie star
Oh, Maria, Maria
She fell in love in East L.A
To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
Played by Carlos Santana


Stop the looting, stop the shooting
Pickpocketing on the corner
See, as the rich is getting richer
The poor is getting poorer
See me and Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
In my mailbox, there's an eviction letter
Signed by the judge, said, "See you later", yeah

I said a la favela los colores
The streets are getting hotter
There is no water to put out the fire
Ni gota de esperanza
See me and Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
Then I looked up in the sky
Hoping that there's a paradise, yeah, yeah

When the wind blows, I can feel you
Through the weather
And even when we are apart
Still feels like we're together, Maria, yeah
