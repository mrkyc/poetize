Just a smile and the rain is gone
Can hardly believe it, yeah
There's an angel standing next to me
Reaching for my heart
Just a smile and there's no way back
Can hardly believe it, yeah
But there's an angel calling me
Reaching for my heart

I know that I'll be okay now
This time, it's real

I lay my love on you, it's all I wanna do
Every time I breathe, I feel brand new
You open up my heart
Show me all your love and walk right through
As I lay my love on you

I was lost in a lonely place
Could hardly believe it, yeah
Holding on to yesterday
Far, far too long
