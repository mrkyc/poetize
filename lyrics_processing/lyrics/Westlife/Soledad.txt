If only you could see the tears
In the world you left behind
If only you could heal my heart just one more time
Even when I close my eyes
There's an image of your face
And once again I come to realise
You're a loss I can't replace

Soledad
It's the keeping for the lonely
Since the day that you were gone
Why did you leave me?
Soledad
In my heart, you were the only
And your memory lives on
Why did you leave me?
Soledad

Walking down the streets of Nothingville
Where our love was young and free
Can't believe just what an empty place it has come to be
I would give my life away
If that could only be the same
'Cause I can't still the voice inside of me
That is calling out your name (Calling out your name)

Time will never change the things you told me
But after all, we're meant to be
Love will bring us back to you and me
If only you could see
