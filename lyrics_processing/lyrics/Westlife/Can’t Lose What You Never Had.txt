Baby you're so beautiful
And when I'm near you
I can't breathe (I can't breathe)
A girl like you gets what she wants when she wants it
You're so out of my league (Out my league)
I show you no emotion
Don't let you see what you're doing to me
(That's what you seeing, baby)
I imagine the two of us together
But I've been living in reality

Fear of rejection, kept my love inside
But time is running out
So damn, my foolish pride

I don't care if you think I'm crazy
It doesn't matter if it turns out bad
I've got no fear of losing you
You can't lose what you never had
Now I'm gonna confess that I love you
I've been keeping it inside
Feeling I could die
But if you turn away, baby, that's okay
At least we'll have a moment before you say goodbye
You can lose what you never had

Rules are made for breaking (Breaking)
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
I'll be no worse off than I am right now
And I might never get that chance again, baby

Fear of rejection, kept my love inside
Told myself I wouldn't love you but I lied

I don't care if you think I'm crazy
It doesn't matter if it turns out bad
I've got no fear of losing you
You can't lose what you never had
Now I'm gonna confess that I love you
I've been keeping it inside
Feeling I could die
But if you turn away, baby, that's okay
At least we'll have a moment before you say goodbye
You can lose what you never had

Here on the outside looking in (Looking in)
Don't wanna stay dreaming about what could have been
Need to hear you speak my name
Even if you shoot me down in flames
I don't care if you think I'm crazy
It doesn't matter if it turns out bad
I've got no fear of losing you
You can't lose what you never had
Now I'm gonna confess that I love you
I've been keeping it inside
Feeling I could die
But if you turn away, baby, that's okay
At least we'll have a moment before you say goodbye
You can lose what you never had

You can't lose what you never had
