Baby, I know the story
I've seen the picture
It's written all over your face
Tell me, what's the secret
That you've been hiding
And who's gonna take my place

I should've seen it coming
I should've read the signs
Anyway, I guess it's over

I can't believe that I'm the fool again
I thought this love would never end
How was I to know?
You never told me
I can't believe that I'm the fool again
And I who thought you were my friend
How was I to know?
You never told me

Baby, you should've called me
When you were lonely
When you needed me to be there
Sadly, you never gave me too many chances
To show you how much I care

About the pain and the tears
Ooh, ooh, ooh
If I could I would turn back the time
Ooh yeah
