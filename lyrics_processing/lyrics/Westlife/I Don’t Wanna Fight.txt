I can't sleep, everything I ever knew
Is a lie without you
I can't breathe when my heart is broke in two
There's no beat without you

You're not gone but you're not here
At least that's the way it seems tonight
If we could try to end these wars
I know that we can make it right
'Cause baby

I don't wanna fight no more
I forgot what we were fighting for
And this loneliness that's in my heart
Won't let me be apart from you
I don't wanna have to try
Girl, to live without you in my life
So I'm hoping we can start tonight
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more

How can I leave when everything that I adore
And everything I'm living for
Girl, it's in you
I can't dream
Sleepless nights have got me bad
The only dream I ever had is being with you

I know that we can make it right
It's gonna take a little time
Let's not leave ourselves with no way out
Let's not cross that line (That line)

I don't wanna fight no more
I forgot what we were fighting for
And this loneliness that's in my heart
Won't let me be apart from you
I don't wanna have to try
Girl, to live without you in my life
So I'm hoping we can start tonight
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more


Remember that I made a vow
That I would never let you go
I meant it then, I mean it now
And I wanna tell you so

I don't wanna fight no more (Oh no)
I forgot what we were fighting for
And this loneliness that's in my heart
Won't let me be apart from you
I don't wanna have to try (No)
Girl, to live without you in my life (Life)
So I'm hoping we can start tonight (Can we start?)
'Cause I don't wanna fight (No more)
I don't wanna fight no more
I forgot what we were fighting for
And this loneliness that's in my heart (In my heart)
Won't let me be apart from you
I don't wanna have to try (Don't wanna try)
Girl, to live without you in my life
So I'm hoping we can start tonight (I'm hoping, I'm hoping, yeah)
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more
It's all a lie without you
