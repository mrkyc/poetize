Suddenly she's leaving
Suddenly the promise of love has gone
Suddenly, breathing seems so hard to do
Carefully you planned it
I got to know just a minute to late, oh girl
Now I understand it
All the times we made love together
Baby, you were thinking of him

Why do I love you? Don't even want to
Why do I love you like I do? Like I always do
You should've told me, why did you have to be untrue?
Love you like I do, why do I love you like I do?

Ain't gonna show no weakness
I'm gonna smile and tell the whole world I'm fine
I'm gonna keep my senses but deep down
When no one can hear me, baby I'll be crying for you

Why do I love you? Don't even want to
Why do I love you like I do? Like I always do
You should've told me, why did you have to be untrue?
Love you like I do, why do I love you like I do?

Suddenly, suddenly

Why do I love you? Don't even want to

Why do I love you? Don't even want to
Why do I love you like I do? Like I always do
You should've told me, why did you have to be untrue?

Why do I love you?
Don't even want to
