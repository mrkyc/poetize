Us against the world, against the world
Us against the world, against the world

You and I, we've been at it so long
But still got the strongest fire
You and I, we still know how to talk
Know how to walk that wire

Sometimes I feel like the world is against me
The sound of your voice, baby, that's what saves me
When we're together I feel so invincible

'Cause it's us against the world, you and me against them all
If you're listening to these words know that we are standing tall
I don't ever see the day that I won't catch you when you fall
'Cause it's us against the world tonight
Us against the world, against the world

There'll be days we'll be on different sides
But that doesn't last too long
We find ways to get it on track
And know how to turn back on

Sometimes I feel I can't keep it together
Then you hold me close and you make it better
When I'm with you I can feel so unbreakable

'Cause it's us against the world, you and me against them all
If you're listening to these words know that we are standing tall
I don't ever see the day that I won't catch you when you fall
'Cause it's us against the world tonight

We're not gonna break 'cause we both still believe
We know what we've got and we've got what we need
All right, we're doing something right

'Cause it's us against the world, you and me against them all
If you're listening to these words know that we are standing tall
I don't ever see the day that I won't catch you when you fall
Us against the world, you and me against them all
If you're listening to these words know that we are standing tall
I don't ever see the day that I won't catch you when you fall
Us against the world, yeah, it's us against the world, baby
Us against the world tonight
Us against the world, against the world
