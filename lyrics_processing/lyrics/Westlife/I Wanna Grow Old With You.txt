Another day just passes by
But now I know how much it means
For you to stay right here with me
The time we spent apart will make our love grow stronger
But it hurt so bad, I can't take it any longer
I wanna grow old with you
I wanna die lyin' in your arms
I wanna grow old with you
I wanna be lookin' in your eyes
I wanna be there for you
Sharin' in everything you do
I wanna grow old with you
A thousand miles between us now
It causes me to wonder how
Our love tonight
(Our love tonight)
Remains so strong
(Remains so strong)
It makes our risk right all along
(It makes our risk)
The time we spent apart will make our love grow stronger
But it hurt so bad, I can't take it any longer
I wanna grow old with you
I wanna die lyin' in your arms
I wanna grow old with you
I wanna be lookin' in your eyes
I wanna be there for you
Sharin' in everything you do
I wanna grow old with you
Things can come and go, I know
(Things can come and go)
But baby I believe
Something's burnin' strong between us
It makes it clear to me
I wanna grow old with you
I wanna die lyin' in your arms
I wanna grow old with you
I wanna be lookin' in your eyes
I wanna be there for you
Sharin' in everything you do
I wanna grow old with you
I wanna die lyin' in your arms
I wanna grow old with you
I wanna be lookin' in your eyes
I wanna be there for you
Sharin' in everything you do
I wanna grow old with you
I wanna die lyin' in your arms
