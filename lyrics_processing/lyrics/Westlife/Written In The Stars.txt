Stay with me
Don't fall asleep too soon
The angels can wait for the moment
Come real close
Forget the world outside
Tonight we're alone
It's finally you and I
It wasn't meant to feel like this
Not without you
Chorus
'Cause when I look at my life
How the pieces fall into place
It just wouldn't rhyme without you
When I see how my path
Seem to end up before your face
The state of my heart, the place where we are
Was written in the stars
Verse 2
Don't be afraid
I'll be right by your side
Through the laughter and pain
Together we're bound to fly
I wasn't meant to love like this
Not without you

I made a few mistakes, yeah

Been through lot of heartache
But I made it back to you
