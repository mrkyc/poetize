Eyes, like a sunrise
Like a rainfall
Down my soul
And I wonder
I wonder why you look at me like that
What you're thinking
What's behind

Don't tell me
But it feels like love

I'm gonna take this moment
And make it last forever
I'm gonna give my heart away
And pray we'll stay together
'Cause you're the one good reason
You're the only girl that I need
'Cause you're more beautiful than I have ever seen
I'm gonna take this night
And make it evergreen

Touch, like an angel
Like velvet to my skin
And I wonder
I wonder why you wanna stay the night
What you're dreaming
What's behind
