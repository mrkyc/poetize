Yeah, ooh
We started as friends
But something happened inside me
Now I'm reading into everything
There's no sign you hear the lightning, baby
You don't ever notice me turning on my charm
Or wonder why I'm always where you are

I've made it obvious
I done everything but sing it
I've crushed on you so long
But on and on you get me wrong
I'm not so good with words
And since you never notice
The way that we belong
I'll say it in a love song

I've heard you talk about (Heard you talk about)
How you want someone just like me (Just like me)
Ooh
Every time I ask you out (Time I ask you out)
We never move pass friendly, no no
You don't ever notice how I stare when we're alone
Or wonder why I keep you on the phone

I've made it obvious
I done everything but sing it
I crushed on you so long (So long)
But on and on you get me wrong
I'm not so good with words
And since you never noticed
The way that we belong
I'll say it in a love song, yeah

You are my very first thought in the morning
And my last at nightfall
You are the love that came without warning
I need you, I want you to know

I've made it obvious
So finally I'll sing it (I've crushed on you so long)
Oh yeah, woo, ooh
I'm not so good with words
Since you never notice
The way that we belong
I'll say it in a love song

The love song, I'll sing it until the day you're holding me, ooh
I've wanted you so long but on and on you get me wrong, ooh yeah
I more than adore you but since you never seem to see
(More than adore you)
Since you never seem to see
