Morning and evening
Baby when you get home
I got a vision
My superstition's gone
Baby I'm shining
You got me flying
Throw me a silver line
Pull me down slowly
Kiss me and hold me tight
We can't hide it
We can't fight it
Just feel as you believe
I put a spell on my heart for ya
Wishin' on a little star for ya
Kinda magic in everything we do
I live and I'd die for ya
Get a little bit high for ya
Forever couldn't come too soon
Running circles 'round the moon
I'm moving over
You're getting closer
Heaven is in your eyes
Mystical wonder
Flowing into our lives
You might also likeSpirits are waking
To love that we're makin'
Angels are on our side
Watchin' and waitin'
Catching the joy we cry
We can't hide it
We can't fight it
Just to feel as you believe
I put a spell on my heart for ya
Wishin' on a little star for ya
Kinda magic in everything we do
I live and I'd die for ya
Get a little bit high for ya
Forever couldn't come too soon
Running circles 'round the moon
Out of my mind
Chasin' circles of love
Just to find
Every lifetime
It's always you
I got a spell on my heart for ya
Wishin' on a little star for ya
Kinda magic in everything we do
I live and I'd die for ya
Get a little bit high for ya
Forever couldn't come too soon
Running circles 'round the moon
Spell on my heart for ya
(Circles 'round the moon)
Wishin' on a little star for ya
(Circles 'round the moon)
Kinda magic in everything we do
(Circles 'round the moon)
I'd live and I'd die for ya
Get a little bit high for ya
Forever couldn't come too soon
