Like I think about you
As these nights grow colder
Do you think about us
All the love that was lost
Looking back as we grow older
Would you cry if I die
Either way nothing changes
And just remember
Don't call me baby, baby
Just because you can
Don't call me lady, boy
You ain't that kind of man
Don't call me sugar, honey
You've never done before
It's just to little to late
This baby's at the door
Do you wish that you cared
Maybe you were too scared
To show me what you're feeling
Did you run out of time
With me on your mind
Didn't we have no meaning
You might also likeWould you bleed if I leave
Either way nothing changes
And just remember
Don't call me baby, baby
Just because you can
Don't call me lady, boy
You ain't that kind of man
Don't call me sugar, honey
You've never done before
It's just to little to late
This baby's at the door
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Don't you cry no more
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Get up off the floor
Don't call me baby, baby
Just because you can
Don't call me lady, boy
You ain't that kind of man
Don't call me sugar, honey
You've never done before
It's just to little to late
This baby's at the door
Don't call me baby, baby
(Don't call me baby)
Just because you can
Don't call me lady, boy
(Don't call me lady)
You ain't that kind of man
Don't call me sugar, honey
(Don't call me sugar)
You've never done before
It's just to little to late
This baby's at the door
Don't call me baby, baby
(Don't call me baby)
Just because you can
Don't call me lady, boy
(Don't call me lady)
You ain't that kind of man
Don't call me sugar, honey
(Don't call me sugar)
You've never done before
It's just to little to late
