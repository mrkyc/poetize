It's important to learn to laugh at ourselves
Don't take life too seriously

You're in a bubble
The money's just doubled
So call the police
'Cause your karma's in trouble
You're in a bubble
Give baby a cuddle
You're losing control
And you're sellin' your soul

Big mouth, big money
You bitch, you ain't that funny
Got somethin' to burn and love to waste
It's a social climb, to big bad taste

Rich bitch, sugar daddy, whizz kids, city boy
Jet setting, go getting, grown-up toys
Heart breakin', money makin', earth-quaking, love fakin'
Where's your heart, did you sell that too?

You're in a bubble

So call the police
'Cause your karma's in trouble
You're in a bubble
Give baby a cuddle
You're losing control
And you're sellin' your soul

Paranoid, star lover
You talk rich and that's your cover
The more you get, the more you chase
Wipe that Prada smile from that rada face

Dressed up, messed up, green-eyed sycophant
Pushy mother, lost brother in real hot pants
Heart breakin', money makin', hot-head fool
To get your own way, divide and rule

You're in a bubble
The money's just doubled
So call the police
'Cause your karma's in trouble
You're in a bubble
Give baby a cuddle
You're losing control
And you're sellin' your soul
(You talk rich, you bitch)
(And that's your cover, star lover)

You're in a bubble
The money's just doubled
So call the police
'Cause your karma's in trouble
You're in a bubble
Give baby a cuddle
You're losing control
And you're sellin' your soul (I'm only joking)
