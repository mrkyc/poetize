Just like an apple
Cut down the middle
I only have one matchin' half
I gave you the finger
You took me to dinner
And you made me laugh

I took one look in your eyes
You know when you know it
You fit me perfectly right
You're the other half of me

I thought love was bullshit
Only for the foolish
But you're the other half of me
I never believed it
Was too proud to need it
But you're the other half of me
You're the other half of me
You're the other half of me

You're better than chocolate
You're right in the pocket
You were tailor-made for me
I wanna have your baby
Gotta have you like crazy (Crazy)
Then iron your shirt
You might also like
I took one look in your eyes
You know when you know it
You fit me perfectly right
You're the other half of me

I thought love was bullshit
Only for the foolish
But you're the other half of me
I never believed it
Was too proud to need it
But you're the other half of me
You're the other half of me
You're the other half of me
Half of me
You're the other half of me

I took one look in your eyes (Your eyes)
You fit me perfectly right
You're the other half of me

I thought love was bullshit
Only for the foolish (Foolish)
But you're the other half of me
I never believed it
Was too proud to need it
But you're the other half of me
(You're the other half of me) You're the other half of me
(You're the other half of me) You're the other half of me
(You're the other half of me) Half of
You're the other half of me
