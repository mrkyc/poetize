You know how I take my time
Then you try to steal my recipe
For making blue love flow like wine
I tick and you tock
I go when you stop
In ever decreasing circles
Ready or not
Baby my groove will get ya
When I talk about love
You just play games
And you tie yourself up
With lust in shackles and chains
When I talk about us
I feel no shame
And I'm never giving up
'Till we talk about
Lovey dovey, dovey stuff
I do smooth and you do rough
I used to think that you were tough
But you're scared
Say that you're not

I can always make your day
I read my books about philosophy
Then we fight before we play
I tick and you tock
I go when you stop
In ever decreasing circles
Ready or not
Baby my groove will get ya
When I talk about love
You just play games
And you tie yourself up
With lust in shackles and chains
When I talk about us
I feel no shame
And I'm never giving up
'Till we talk about
Lovey dovey dovey stuff
When little bad boys come out to play
They kiss all the girls and run away from love
When good little girls are feeling hot
He comes and he goes but he doesn't stop for love
When I talk about love
You just play games
And you tie yourself up
With lust in shackles and chains
When I talk about us
I feel no shame
And I'm never giving up
'Till we talk about
Lovey dovey, dovey stuff
Lovey dovey, dovey stuff
I do smooth and you do rough
I used to think that you were tough
But you're scared
Lovey dovey, dovey stuff
I do smooth and you do rough
I used to think that you were tough
But you're not

Lovey dovey, dovey stuff
