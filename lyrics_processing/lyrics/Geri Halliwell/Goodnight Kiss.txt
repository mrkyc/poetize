I ain't sleepin'
Too much in my head
I've been thinkin'
Somethin's left unsaid
And in the mornin'
Feelin' just the same
Boy, it's killin' me
I ain't cryin'
Don't wanna be alone
Just need liftin'
From my melancholy tone

Make no mistake, a little too late
Is just too long
Don't ask me why, this is goodbye
If you do me wrong

So baby, tonight, I might let you in
No need to fight, I'm yours, so let's begin
But baby, I know, when you go, your touch I'll miss
But startin' tonight, if you don't treat me right
Then it's just gonna end as a goodnight kiss
You might also like
Boy, you're dreamin'
You don't know what to do
Don't be shy
Stop, I'm coming through
And in the meantime
If you have a little doubt

Make no mistake, it's never too late
What's done can be undone
Don't be afraid to do what I say
The best is yet to come

So baby, tonight, I might let you in
No need to fight, I'm yours, so let's begin
But baby, I know, when you go, your touch I'll miss
But startin' tonight, if you don't treat me right
Then it's just gonna end as a goodnight kiss

I'd rather be lonely than be with a phoney
If I'm not the girl in your head
I'd rather be wrong if it doesn't feel right
'Cause, boy, you're killin' me tonight
So baby, tonight, I might let you in
No need to fight, I'm yours, so let's begin
But baby, I know, when you go, your touch I'll miss
But startin' tonight, if you don't treat me right
Then it's just gonna end as a goodnight kiss

(Baby, tonight, I might let you in) A goodnight kiss
(No need to fight, I'm yours, so let's begin) A goodnight kiss
(Baby, I know, when you go, your touch I'll miss) A goodnight kiss
(But startin' tonight, if you don't treat me right)
(Then it's just gonna end as a goodnight kiss) A goodnight kiss
(Baby, tonight, I might, let you in) A goodnight kiss
(No need to fight, I'm yours, so let's begin) A goodnight kiss
