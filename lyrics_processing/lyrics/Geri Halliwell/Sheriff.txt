Gotta be the sheriff
Hey girl, nice girl
Gotta-be-on-time girl
East girl, fight girl
Whatever's-on-your-mind girl
You've had enough
Don't give it up
But somebody's undercover
Nice girl, spice girl
Steppin'-outta-line girl
Bad girl, sad girl
Always-on-a-diet girl
You're so enough
Deserve that love
All shapes and colors
Oh, you act like you don't care
But the way you wear your hair gives you away
Everyday
Ooh, it's good to know the difference
Ooh, between a woman and a man
You're a runner, he's a walker
He's a yeller, you're a talker
Y'all just doing the best you can
You might also likeI said, ooh-ooh-ooh, 'cause you gotta be the sheriff
When I do-ooh-ooh-ooh try to walk out
Have to be a man
Gotta be the sheriff
Bad man, sad man
Just-one-of-the-lads man
Straight man, gay man
Wanna be a superman
You're so enough
Deserve that love
All shapes and colors
Oh, you act like you don't care
But the way you wear your hair gives you away
Everyday
Ooh, it's good to know the difference
Ooh, between a woman and a man
You're a runner, he's a walker
He's a yeller, you're a talker
Y'all just doing the best you can
I said, ooh-ooh-ooh, 'cause you gotta be the sheriff
When I do-ooh-ooh-ooh try to walk out
Have to be a man
Gotta be the sheriff
Ooh, it's good to know the difference
Ooh, between a woman and a man
Ooh, it's good to know the difference
Ooh, between a woman and a man
Oh, you act like you don't care
But the way you wear your hair gives you away
Everyday
Ooh, it's good to know the difference
Ooh, between a woman and a man
You're a runner, he's a walker
He's a yeller, you're a talker
Y'all just doing the best you can
I said, ooh-ooh-ooh, 'cause you gotta be the sheriff
When I do-ooh-ooh-ooh try to walk out
Have to be a man
Gotta be the sheriff
