Always be something we don't understand
Like who is God and what's the plan
And we are wandering in the dark
Looking out for love and life
When all you need is here inside
It's the same for people all around the world
Could you believe?
All the miracles never thought would ever happen
All our foolish wishes they can bring out dreams to life
You could believe
We can wait all day only when nobody's watching
All I want's you find yourself believing in the miracle of love
Don't stop believing in this world that we live in
It's the power of love that is strong enough
We are trying to be positive
It's so easy to be cynical
Missing those little miracles
Oh, we are wondering what is love
We're so busy when we're keeping score
Tell me what you're fighting for

Could you believe?
All the miracles never thought would ever happen
All our foolish wishes they can bring out dreams to life
You could believe
We can wait all day only when nobody's watching
All I want's you find yourself believing in the miracle of love
When you feel left out in the cold
When darkness seems to have its say
Miracle is on its way
Don't stop believing in this world that we live in
It's the power of love that is strong enough
It's a miracle! A miracle never thought would ever happen
All our foolish wishes, they can bring out dreams to life
You could believe
We can wait all day only when nobody's watching
All I want's you find yourself believing in the miracle of love
Don't stop believing in this world that we live in
It's the power of love that is strong enough
Don't stop believing in this world that we live in
