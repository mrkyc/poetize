You said I'd always be your little girl
Thought that would last forever
But you left me in this grown up world
I had to pull myself together

At the end of the day
You showed me the way (Showed me the way)
I'm never in doubt

Someone's watching over me
Though sometimes I wish that you would look away from me
Always watching over me
Though it's not perfect, it can't be any other way for me

You said to me that time would never wait
So I ran a little faster
I was always there, but just too late
So fate became a father

At the end of the day
You showed me the way (Showed me the way)
I'm never in doubt
You might also like
Someone's watching over me
Though sometimes I wish that you would look away from me
Always watching over me
Though it's not perfect, it can't be any other way for me

You left a girl with a hungry mind
I'm still learning and I'm still waiting
All of my answers I need to find

Someone's watching over me
Though sometimes I wish that you would look away from me
Always watching over me
Though it's not perfect, it can't be any other way for me
Someone's watching over me (I hope that you can see me now)
Though sometimes I wish that you would look away from me (I'll try my best to make you proud)
Always watching over me (I'll always be my daddy's girl)
Though it's not perfect, it can't be any other way for me (I'll see you in another world)
Someone's watching over me (I hope that you can see me now)
Though sometimes I wish that you would look away from me (I'll try my best to make you proud)
Always watching over me (I'll always be my daddy's girl)
Though it's not perfect, it can't be any other way for me (I'll see you in another world)
