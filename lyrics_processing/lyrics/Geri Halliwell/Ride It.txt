I'll be ridin' it
I'll be ridin' it

Wanna make some music
To take me in and out of my head
Get into my groove
In time with my body instead

And when the bass kicks in
I can feel my song beginnin'
Boy, your lovin' gets me high
'Cause you're the only one
Who can pump it loud the way I like

You're a DJ, I'm a song
Take me out and turn me on
Let yourself go
I'll be ridin' it
Chicas bumpin' to the beat
From the side and underneath
Yeah, my body's where this party's at
I'll be ridin' it
When you're spinnin' it
I'll be ridin' it
You might also like
He's a little rude and nasty
His tempo is on overload
He gets jiggy with it here
But all I wanna do is vogue

And when the bass kicks in
I can dance like no one's watchin'
It's a funny kind of feeling
'Cause you're the only one
Who can pump it loud the way I like

You're a DJ, I'm a song
Take me out and turn me on
Let yourself go
I'll be ridin' it
Chicas bumpin' to the beat
From the side and underneath
Yeah, my body's where this party's at
I'll be ridin' it
When you're spinnin' it
I'll be ridin' it
When you're spinnin' it
I'll be ridin' it
And when the bass kicks in
I can dance like no one's watchin'
It's a funny kind of feeling
'Cause you're the only one
Who can pump it loud the way I like

You're a DJ, I'm a song
Take me out and turn me on
Let yourself go
I'll be ridin' it
Chicas bumpin' to the beat
From the side and underneath
Yeah, my body's where this party's at
I'll be ridin' it
You're a DJ I'm a song
Take me out and turn me on (turn me on)
When you're spinnin' it
I'll be ridin' it
Chicas bumpin' to the beat
From the side and underneath (turn me on)
When you're spinnin' it
I'll be ridin' it
When you're spinnin' it
I'll be ridin' it
When you're spinnin' it
I'll be ridin' it
