Lonely hearts are welcome here
Take my hand, let's disappear
Serenity is almost here, oh, Lord (Oh-oh-oh)

Don't let life pass you by
Jump on in, get ready to fly

Gimme some, gimme some gasoline
Tell me what you want, know what I mean
And scream if you wanna go faster, baby (Scream if you wanna go faster)
Scream if you wanna go faster (Scream if you wanna go faster)

Leave behind the walk of shame
Take my hand, you're not to blame
Surrender to what you can't change, oh, God (Oh-oh-oh)

Don't let love pass you by
Let it in and don't ask why

Gimme some, gimme some gasoline
Tell me what you want, know what I mean
And scream if you wanna go faster, baby (Scream if you wanna go faster)
Scream if you wanna go faster (Scream if you wanna go faster)
Gimme some, gimme some sweet F.A
"Have a nice day", as americans say
And scream if you wanna go faster, baby (Scream if you wanna go faster)
Scream if you wanna go faster (Scream if you wanna go faster)

(Scream if you wanna go faster, faster)

Gimme some, gimme some gasoline
Tell me what you want, know what I mean
And scream if you wanna go faster, baby (Scream if you wanna go faster)
Scream if you wanna go faster (Scream if you wanna go faster)
Gimme some, gimme some sweet F.A
"Have a nice day", as americans say
And scream if you wanna go faster, baby (Scream if you wanna go faster)
Scream if you wanna go faster (Scream if you wanna go faster)
Scream if you wanna go faster, baby
Scream if you wanna go faster

(Scream if you wanna go faster)
