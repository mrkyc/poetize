Good-lookin', bad-tastin'
Full-bodied, butt wasted
Loose livin', tight-fitting
What you see ain't what you are getting
Big make-up, little break-up
She wants it, he's got it
Cold-blooded, hot gossip
Superficial expectations

Look at me
You can take it all because this
Face is free
Maybe next time, use your eyes and
Look at me
I'm a drama queen if that's your
Thing, baby
I can even do reality

Ah-ah-ah-ah

Fake honey, real plastic
Stupid cupid, fantastic
Queer thinking, straight talkin'
What you see ain't what you are getting
Fast-loving, slow-movin'
No rhythm, but I'm groovin'
Old-feeling, new beginning
Superficial expectations

Look at me
You can take it all because this
Face is free
Maybe next time, use your eyes and
Look at me
I'm a drama queen if that's your
Thing, baby
I can even do reality

That's me, haha

Sometimes, I don't recognise my own face
I look inside my eyes and find disgrace
My little white lies tell a story
I see it all, it has no glory
Huh, haha

Look at me
You can take it all because this
Face is free
Maybe next time, use your eyes and
Look at me
I'm a drama queen if that's your
Thing, baby
I can even do reality
Come on and look at me
This face is free
I'm your fantasy
So who'd you wanna be?
Not what you see
I'm a drama queen
If that's your thing
Come on and look at me (Look at me)
I'm your fantasy
This face is free (Face is free)
Come on and look at me
So who'd you wanna be? (Look at me)
This face is free
Come on and look at me (Thing, baby)
I'm your fantasy
Come on and look at me (Look at me)
Not what you see
I'm a drama queen (Face is free)
If that's your thing
Come on and look at me (Look at me)
So who'd you wanna be?
