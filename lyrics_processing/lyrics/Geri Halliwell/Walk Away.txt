Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

There's a river of tears I need to cry
Been holding back for years
There's a mountain so high I need to climb
To wipe away the fears
Solitude and loneliness have been a friend of mine
As I'm turning my back on emptiness
I leave them all behind

Who knows just where I'm going
Does tomorrow belong to me?

Walk away, this time with my head up high
Walk away, just me and myself
Walk away with pride, nothing left to hide
But it just feels right to be one
And just walk away

I could never forget how hard I tried
When we were, oh, so young
Just one tender moment I cannot find
Well, maybe, I had none
Strength will be by my side, although I feel afraid
But I know it's too late for this goodbye
There's nothing left to say
You might also like
Who knows just where I'm going
Does tomorrow belong to me?

Walk away, this time with my head up high
Walk away, just me and myself
Walk away with pride, nothing left to hide
But it just feels right to be one
And just walk away

This time, one day you'll realise
That the tears you saw in my eyes
Will be there forever

Walk away, this time with my head up high
Walk away, just me and myself
Walk away with pride, nothing left to hide
But it just feels right to be one
And just walk away

(Walk away, this time with my head up high) And just walk away
(Walk away, just me and myself) And just walk away
(Walk away with pride, nothing left to hide) And just walk away
(But it just feels right to be one) And just walk away
(Walk away, this time with my head up high) And just walk away
(Walk away, just me and myself)
(Walk away with pride, nothing left to hide)
(But it just feels right to be one)
