A heart full of love
A back full of hope
And I hope I'm enough
Gotta put on my boots
And make sure my laces tight
I've remembered the chocolate
Remembered the wine
All of the things I forgot last time
Gonna follow my guide
Every step is mine
This time

When there's no one left to blame
And no one left to hate
Only where I made my name
I can truly know my place
I can climb my mountain high

Step by step, day by day
Little by little I will find my way
I'm gonna climb my mountain
I'm gonna climb my mountain
You might also likeUnder burning sun
Roaring from the sky
One step, then another
Run for cover
Never ones may die
I can climb my mountain high
I light up the top on the snow-covered peak
If God lips are bad, then let's have them to speak
About the walk of my life and why does it hurt my feet
My feet

When there's no one left to hate
And all that's left is love
We'll do without your fate
Just know that you're in love
You can climb your mountain high

Step by step, day by day
Little by little I will find my way
I'm gonna climb my mountain
I'm gonna climb my mountain
Rhythm then, rhythm now
Never go ever, I'll work it out
I'm gonna climb my mountain
I'm gonna climb my mountain
Under burning sun
Roaring from the sky
One step, then another
Run for cover
Never ones may die
When I reached the top of the mountain
The man said to me
The man on the mountain said
"I haven't got a penny, but I'm free
I'm not afraid of anything"
Step by step, day by day
Little by little I will find my way
I'm gonna climb my mountain
I'm gonna climb my mountain
It's a wet flat stone I'm slipping on
It's a wet flat stone I'm slipping on
