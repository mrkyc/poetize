(Treat him like a lady)
Uh-huh, uh-huh

I like chocolate and controversy
He likes fridays and bad company
I like midnight, it's when I'm in the mood
But he likes the morning, that's when he's rude

Just a bad case of opposite sex
Have to look to the stars
All we need is a little respect
'Cause men are from Venus
And girls are from Mars

Bag it up, don't drop the baby
Boot him out, no "buts" or "maybe"
Wind him up and make him crazy
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Take him back, don't drop the baby
Spit him out, no "buts" or "maybe"
Do your thing, come on lady
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, lady

I don't take sugar on my colour tv
Yet he likes it loaded with eye candy
I need some space, and he needs a room
But then he keeps me waiting
By leaving too soon

Just a bad case of opposite sex
Have to look to the stars
All we need is a little respect
'Cause men are from Venus
And girls are from Mars

Bag it up, don't drop the baby
Boot him out, no "buts" or "maybe"
Wind him up and make him crazy
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Take him back, don't drop the baby
Spit him out, no "buts" or "maybe"
Do your thing, come on lady
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, lady

Treat him like a lady
Treat him like a lady
Tease him, please me, chase me, yeah
Just a bad case of opposite sex
Have to look to the stars
All we need is a little respect
'Cause men are from Venus
And girls are from Mars

Bag it up, don't drop the baby
Boot him out, no "buts" or "maybe"
Wind him up and make him crazy
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Take him back, don't drop the baby
Spit him out, no "buts" or "maybe"
Do your thing, come on lady
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Treat him like a lady (bag it up)
Treat him like a lady (boot him out)
Treat him like a lady (wind him up)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Treat him like a lady (take him back)
Treat him like a lady (spit him out)
Treat him like a lady (do your thing)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
You know what to do now
You're in control
Who's wearing the trousers now?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Treat him like a lady and spit him out
