We're on a night run
Boy you better hold your tongue
Talking like you're coming from kingdom come
Rhythm and reeling, the feeling I'm riding
The sound through the ceiling
Never got no money
But I'm running from the gun
My engines flooded
Cold blooded no money
Drunk on something, uh
Killing the moonlight with daylight
I got my X-ray eyes
And I'm feeling so fine

Night running, all night running (We running)
Star-studded, not far from it (We roll)
We're running, all night running (We running)
Cold blooded, all night running (We roll)
Night running, all night running (We running)
Star-studded, not far from it (We roll)
Night running, all night running (We running)
Cold blooded, we're all night running (We roll)

We're on the nightshade
Tell me what we're hiding from
Like someone could steal it
Are we waiting for some kind of feeling
Or saving it up for the morning?
Undercover
The cloak and dagger
Is there a creature in the attic?
Are we for real, yeah?
Or just pretending?
Will it burn out by the morning?

We're on a night run
No telling who we're running from
In a world of secrets and demons and people hiding from the sun
Sending my message to everyone losing control
Better not stop 'til I get home
Sentimental flowers don't grow
Got to live through tidal waves
And parishes and biblical floods
I got the gris-gris love
And the streets in my blood
I'm on the final run
Falling in and out of love, oh

Night running, all night running (We running)
