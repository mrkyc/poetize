When I was a young man, I never needed anyone
Bruised and broken, shattered, always on the run
Safe behind a half-smile, laying in the shadows
I became a rich man, I held the world up with my hands
Inside I was a poor man, still screaming, "I don't understand"
"Why am I always running?" "Why am I always hiding?"
"What's the point in living when living feels like dying?"

You can build your walls, love will tear it down
You can hide your heart inside a man-made house
You can build your walls, build 'em to the sky
One day you will find love was on both sides
The war is over

I came upon a wise man, he said, "Sit beside me son"
"When I was a young man, I was like you, the Prodigal Son"
Safe behind a half-smile, hidin' in the shadows
Tell 'em that it's all right, tell 'em 'cause you said so

You can build your walls, love will tear it down
You can hide your heart inside a man-made house
You can build your walls, build 'em to the sky
One day you will find love was on both sides

The war is over, love's already won

Time stands still so long
I feel so low
I know what follows, what follows

You can build your walls, but love will tear it down
You can hide your heart inside a man-made house
You can build your walls, build 'em to the sky
One day you will find love was on both sides

The war is over, love's already won
The war is over, the war is over
The war is over, love's already won
