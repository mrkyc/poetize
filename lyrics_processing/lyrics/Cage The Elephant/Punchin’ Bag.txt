She's a stone-cold straight-faced killer and a lover
And she won't put up with another brute who only wants to bruise her
Take her love and then abuse her

She won't take no more, won't take no more
Won't take no more, won't take no more

Oh no, ain't it a drag
If you take a swing, does she swing back?
She say, "I'm not your punchin' bag"

Heaven help ya, I'm telling the truth
Heaven help ya, she's coming for you
Heaven help ya, the girl likes to fight
Afraid of nothing and she carries a knife

She said, (Oh no) "I'm not your punchin' bag
(Oh no) I'm not your punchin' bag
I'm not your punchin' bag"

What kind of man are you?
Instead of kisses, you gave bruises
No more time for cheap excuses
If I were you, I would be leaving
Best you go while you're still breathing

Oh no, ain't it a drag
If you take a swing, the kid swings back
She say, "I'm not your punchin' bag"

Heaven help ya, I'm telling the truth
Heaven help ya, she's coming for you
Heaven help ya, the girl likes to fight

(Oh no) I'm not your punchin' bag"

Last time, last time you're ever gonna
Last time, last time you're ever gonna
Last time, last time you're ever gonna
Last time, last time you're ever gonna
Oh no, ain't it a drag
"Everywhere you go, better watch your back
'Cause I'm not your punchin' bag"

Heaven help ya, the girl likes to fight
Afraid of nothing and she carries a knife
