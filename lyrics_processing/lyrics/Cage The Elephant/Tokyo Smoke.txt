Hey man
Hand me down with the crooked back
What's your father's name? Boy, you don't know where you're at
Pick yourself up, you don't look so good
Maybe you should lay down
Taught me how to fall
But you never told me I was supposed to stay down

Stick and move
Sharpen up the knife
Keep it tight
Stay between the lines
Make your mark
Take your own advice
Don't be surprised when you trip and stumble
I played the fool again
My old unfaithful friend
Stick and move
Sharpen up the knife
Don't be surprised if you can't stay between the lines

Quicksand color blind in the hourglass
All spun out 'cause you can't stop looking back
Better stay still, don't you make a move
What'd you hope to find here?
Taught me how to fall
But you never told me I was meant to die here

Stick and move
Sharpen up the knife
Keep it tight
Stay between the lines
Make your mark
Take your own advice
Don't be surprised when you trip and stumble
I played the fool again
My old unfaithful friend
Stick and move
Sharpen up the knife
Don't be surprised if you can't stay between the lines

Endless shot rounds
No smoking guns
Fizzled and faded
Now back on the run
My sticks and stones
Tokyo smoke
I played the fool 'til I started to choke
My public smile
My double face
Half in the light
Half in the shade
Need some fresh air
No place tonight
Guess I'll stay in and continue to fight
Lost, trace of trail
Spiderweb spun
Pale white and blue
Now I'm coming undone
Play sticks and stones
Three shades of black
Two steps away
