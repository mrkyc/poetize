Triple X bottle, role models from hell
Livin' our dreams we like to scream and yell
White boys, B-Boys raised in the gutter
I said when I'd grow up I'd be a bad motherfucker
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'm breaking the rules, I'm gonna do it if it's not allowed
Thought I wouldn't when I would, would when I wouldn't
I did it for the reason everybody said I couldn't
I'm putting my best foot down like what now
Let's take it to the bridge and jump the fuck down
Fuck it like a clown jump off a building in a bucket
The worst is yet to come, here it comes so bum rush it

Would you jump off a bridge if I told you to?
Would you change the way you live if I told you to?
Would you jump off a bridge if I told you to?
Well, take it to the bridge and jump the fuck off
Would you jump off a bridge if I told you to?
Would you change the way you live if I told you to?
Would you jump off a bridge if I told you to?
Well, take it to the bridge and jump the fuck off

Are you ready to jump? (Mm-hmm)
Are you ready to leap? (Hell, yeah)
Well, the head rush is heavy but for many too deep
I ain't sayin' much to many but the words on the street
That were speeding up the world to keep the timing on beat
It keeps reminding everybody who's a pyramid freak
The pyramid eye, the figure inside
The leader that you follow the day that you die
We always bring it live which makes it easy to choose
Ain't no grieving or consoling or singing the blues
So when the levee breaks just remember the drums
And when the levee breaks, don't forget how to run
Remember what I've done and everything that I said
I'm living proof that you can jump and live to try it again!

I'm torn like Korn playing Follow the Leader
In a baggy pair of dickies and a dirty wife beater
Should they rate a CD like a movie in a theater?
Should they blame it on me?, I say we blame it on you
Or blame it on the world there's no excuse for the things we do
Life's a maze, I'll be amazed if I find my way through
One, two, tell me whatcha gonna do
You gonna jump off the bridge like I told ya to
That's right (uh-huh), bum rush the stage
Whatcha made of? How much more can you take?
Half of my life's been one big mistake
But no one's gonna take my place
One, two, tell me whatcha gonna do
You gonna jump off the bridge like I told you to
That's right, bum rush the stage
What you made of? How much can you take?
Would you jump off a bridge if I told you to?
Would you change the way you live if I told you to?
Would you jump off a bridge if I told you to?
Well, take it to the bridge and jump the fuck off

Would you jump off a bridge if I told you to?
Well, take it to the bridge and jump the fuck off

Monkey see and monkey do
Monkey see and monkey do
Monkey see and monkey do
Don't try to be like me, you gotta be like you
If you can hear this you're catchin' the contact
If you can hear this you're bumpin' the sound
If you're in the earshot you're catchin' the contact
If you can hear this you're bumpin' the sound

Jump off a bridge if I told you to
Jump off a bridge if I told you to
Jump off a bridge if I told you to
