And all I need is just, is just a little more time, a little bit
I said a little more love, a little bit more sunshine
Just a little more would be fine
And all I need is just, is just a little more time, a little bit
I said a little more love, a little bit more sunshine
Just a little more would be fine

I've walked forever down this dusty road, a life of passion accented by the scent of a rose
And no one said it'd be easy, man believe me I know
Cause it's hard for you to bloom when you need room to grow
So you're never too young, you're never too old
I'm still trying to chase the rainbow to my pot of gold
I've seen a lot of the world and I wanna see more
I wanna notice all the things I didn't see before
Life isn't perfect, but I know that it's worth it
I guess I'm just another clown in this so called circus
Tryin' to keep my hustle got my back to the win
I'm trying to make it to the top for some oxygen
Every tatt on my skin, every place that I've been
Every girl that I've lost, I don't know where to begin
It's like, reading the signs starts to mess with your mind, it looks like love is the drug that gets me every time

And all I need is just, is just a little more time, a little bit
I said a little more love, a little bit more sunshine
Just a little more would be fine

There's too much pressure on my mind, I've been faithful against all signs
Found love, to go alone I'm fine, on my way back I'm gonna take what's mine
It's never too much, could it be love (uh). It's always too much and never enough, gone
Every peak is like a moment of bliss and then I'm left with just a desperate wish
I'm passionate please, I'm breaking the hex, I'm down on my knees I'm breaking my neck, until there's nothing left
Caught up with needs and covered with sweat, the simplest things is what we forget, we forget
I'm spreading my wings and leavin' regret. Livin' like kings and losing our breath
And when the angel sings I know that it'll be alright, it'll be alright

And all I need is just, is just a little more time, a little bit
I said a little more love, a little bit more sunshine
Just a little more would be fine
And all I need is just, is just a little more time, a little bit
I said a little more love, a little bit more sunshine
Just a little more would be fine

Wishing on stars and chasing dreams (here we go, here we go again)
Fallen angels with broken wings (here we go, here we go)
Wishing on stars and chasing dreams (here we go, here we go again)

And all I need is just, is just a little more time, a little bit

And all I need is just, is just a little more time, a little bit
I said a little more love, a little bit more sunshine
Just a little more would be fine
(A little more, little more)
(A little more, little more)
(A little more, little more)
