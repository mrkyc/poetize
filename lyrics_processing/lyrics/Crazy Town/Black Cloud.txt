Now people say I'm jinxed, I got some kind of voodoo hex
Life is so complex, there's no telling what can happen next
Life on the edge fuels the sickness in my head
It imbeds the type of thoughts that got a lot of brothers dead
The smarter brother knows to keep his foes close
And I'm the type of brother that's smarter than most
A cold hearted overdose of lyrical antidotes
The cure to make sure my karma can't take me down
Up to the same old tricks, I wonder if I'll stick around
Is a penny really lucky if you find it on the ground?
What's the problem with this town? I can't figure it out
My karma's crashing down in the form of a black cloud

I've got a little black cloud that follows me
Everywhere I go, it takes over me
I've got a little black cloud that follows me
Everywhere I go, it takes over me

I'm sick, I've got a real ill disposition
My intentions are pure but there's a cure for my condition
My decisions put me in the wrong positions
Chasing pipe dreams of fame and recognition
The Epic, not only a name, a definition
My game remains no matter the pain, I stay the charmer
The Don of Karma. I navigate it like the Dalai Lama
I ain't a saint, but I've got Joi de vie
And I'm the one to blame if the cloud rains on me
I can't complain about it or even let regret
Provoke the energy it takes for me to get upset
A bad boy since birth so I can't forget
What goes around comes around and it ain't got me yet
I've gotten wise in my age and tamed the threat of my rage
I've got a lot to learn and I've got money to spend
To pretend is reaping more than sewing ever could mend

Trade my torches for a dime
The pressure's fading away now
Black clouds, lifted for the lights
The pressure's fading away now
A thousand cigarettes won't change the way we feel
The pressure's fading now
Can you bare the thought of knowing truth?
Knowing truth

I was rapping in the rain, hoping that my luck would change
And if there's any truth to all those old sayings
'Cause if I killed a spider, would my house catch on fire?
If I walked under a ladder would it matter?
I tend to laugh when black cats cross my path
Break mirrors in half, just to test the aftermath
Now here comes rain, I project my pain
Trying to make sense of these crazy things

I'm a diamond in the rough, could I suffer enough?
I'm getting high for a living, not giving a fuck
These hard times got me stuck, stuck in a jam
I'm the monkey on your back and the crack in the dam
Disastrous, took time to master this
And the past is just a map to capture this
In the darkness, I'm forced to adapt to this
I would change the past if I could have one wish
Trade my torches for a dime
The pressure's fading away now
Black clouds, lifted for the lights
The pressure's fading away now
A thousand cigarettes won't change the way we feel
The pressure's fading now
Can you bare the thought of knowing truth?
Knowing truth

(Black cloud)
I got a little black cloud
(Black cloud)
Knowing truth
I got a little black cloud
(Black cloud)
I got a little black cloud
Knowing truth
I got a little black cloud
(Black cloud)
I got a little black cloud
Knowing truth
