Crazy...

Now ladies come, ladies go out my revolving door
Some ladies never come back, most come back for more
I've got a house in the hills with a door that spins
Goes in and out, out and in, 'round and 'round again

I live a life these player haters would love to be livin'
Since a kid, I've been surrounded by beautiful women
And slippin' in them to win them, the unforgiven
Still something's missin'
'Cause deep inside I'm sufferin' of a lonely heart condition
Wishin' I could find a girl that'll take me away
From the chaos of the city and the everyday part that I play
Tell me why lay low, why say no
When I got girls serenadin' at my window?
Ladies good to go, we's major league, the new breed, no so-so
Highly advanced and got the game to get in any girl's pants (That's right)
And romance her stone 'cause I more than hold my own
They call me Shifty Capone, I make 'em moan
Yes, I'm the one
Between the sheets, I amaze and stun
Ain't no need for me to brag about the way that I'm hung
Let's just say I got the skills to get the fliest girl sprung
Or to take and make an older lady feel young (That's right)

I keep my girls in rotation, door rotating
You looking for a good time, I'm always on vacation
So stop by baby if you want to try your luck
But don't waste my time unless you're down to fuck
Unless you're comin' back for more, well then you know what's up
You know the routine
Girl, you're not the one, you're just a one-night fling
Some ass to hold this casanova over 'til the right girl pass
And when the right girl pass, I'll drop this lifestyle fast
'Cause what I'm really lookin' for is the one that'll last
And make my present the past, my adolescence surpassed
By the will to chill
I'm lookin' for something real in a world of fake hoes in high heels

I'll drop hot wax on your nipples, causin' trouble
And when you ride me, yo, I'll be throwing up that triple double
My sex drive's kickin', I'm sexually explorin'
So many possibilities, it seems my life could never get boring
'Cause I'm ain't fuckin' around, I'll rub you down the right way
I'll rock your world nightly, so can I hit it lightly?
Yo, girl, I like it like that, let me hit it from the back
I'm a natural aphrodisiac (Better known as a Mac!)
