Now, we push rhymes!
Crazy rhymes, words force-fed to your mind
Trace the source (Brother, brother!)
Face the music, don't confuse it for another
Nothing comes close to this
Kiss the sky, these grands change hands as our fans multiply
We push rhymes!
People gather 'round when we kick 'em
Go boy, Shifty! Stick 'em!
Ha ha ha, stick 'em!
Burnin' bridges, smoking 'ism, losin' my religion
Shootin' the breeze, we got these MC's ass kissin'
If you can't take the heat, then get your ass out of the kitchen!
I freak it off the wall
Crammin', slammin' points of views into your fuckin' skull!
Bitch, that's why we stick 'em!

Brrr, stick 'em! (Ha ha ha, stick 'em!)
Ha, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em!
Brrr, stick 'em! (Ha ha ha, stick 'em!)
Stick 'em, stick 'em, stick 'em! (Stick 'em!)
Brrr, stick 'em! (Ha ha ha, stick 'em!)
Ha, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em!
Brrr, stick 'em!

Well, if I tapped you on the spinal with an anesthetic
Epic is the definition, written into grooves of vinyl
It's called survival when I drop the stylish into friction
Tectonic traits, driftin' like the plates
It shakes like the quakes in Cali, the mystic Majaraji
Mission of the kamikaze comeback kid
Producer super status, I'm here to claim my reign
As the baddest beat peddler (So place your bet, middler!)
The roof is ablaze and yo, we're smokin' out the fiddler
We're sippin' on a hundred-proof liquor
Welcome to the doomsday dawning, hot like the sun
No time to relax, we pack the doomsday gun!

Stick 'em! (Ha ha ha, stick 'em!)
Ha, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em!
Brrr, stick 'em! (Ha ha ha, stick 'em!)
Stick 'em, stick 'em, stick 'em! (Stick 'em!)
Brrr, stick 'em! (Ha ha ha, stick 'em!)
Ha, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em!
Brrr, stick 'em!

Call me a drifter, Richter
When I hit you with the stick, I'm talkin' shit!
The pit starter!
A wanted man the one who cuffed your daughter to my bed stand and...
I talk a lot of shit because I know a lot of shit!
I know, I said I'd quit, but I just want another hit
It's madness, pimpin' like Gladys
The baddest, maintain our status, that ain't no question
Releasing tension as we step into the seventh dimension
This jabber jaw's jaws are slapping (We's what's happening!)
Bones are breakin' and fingers snappin'
The pressure's on, with non-stop action
Whether bangin' your head or steady maxin'!
Stick 'em! (Ha ha ha, stick 'em!)
Ha, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em!
Brrr, stick 'em! (Ha ha ha, stick 'em!)
Stick 'em, stick 'em, stick 'em! (Stick 'em!)
Brrr, stick 'em! (Ha ha ha, stick 'em!)
Ha, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em!
