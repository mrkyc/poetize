I look into the mirror and spit
Knowing no better than me that I need to quit
Hot brimstone in my catcher's mitt
Step to the plate and I bite my lip

And may the bridges I'ved burned light the way, light the way, light the way
And may the bridges I burn light the way, light the way light the way

 a kaleidoscope
Plasticene, now I'm cleaner than a bar of soap
And you can make a toast with a black rose, the old ghosts
Drugs like a slug in the chest, I'm so west coast

And I dance with demons daily
I don't blame you, I even hate me
And I dance with demons daily
I wander the hall, fuck it all, I'm crazy
Now is it just too much?
Or is it just enough?
Is it just too much?
They all fall down!

And may the bridges I burn light the way, light the way, light the way
And may the bridges I burn light the way, light the way, light the way
And may the bridges I burn light the way, light the way, light the way
And may the bridges I burn light the way, light the way to a brand new day

Mr. Bad Brain, I'm your fire starter
Shifty gang bang, tank tops, and Prada
I'm a Armeggedon treasure, heavenly father
Break a ten/four, can you copy me, Roger?
I'm a villain, killin' em, Homeboy, please
You can't see the forest when you're stuck in a trees
You can't be the boss when you're down on your knees
And you won't get far if you're fucking with me
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe

And I dance with demons daily
I don't blame you, I even hate me
And I dance with demons daily
I wander the hall, fuck it all, I'm crazy
Now is it just too much?
Or is it just enough?
Is it just too much?
They all fall down!
And may the bridges I burn light the way, light the way, light the way
And may the bridges I burn light the way, light the way, light the way
And may the bridges I burn light the way, light the way, light the way
And may the bridges I burn light the way, light the way to a brand new day!
Into a brand new day!
Into a brand new day!
Into a brand new day!
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe

Late night overexposure
Play nice, hand on my holster
Bar fights make me feel closer
Flashing lights, cops pull me over
White noise, screams in the night, freeze!
I run like they're not gonna catch me
One time more, once in a strip show
Blood runs deep, talk's cheap, take a risk, go

Take a risk, go
Take a risk, go
Take a risk, go
