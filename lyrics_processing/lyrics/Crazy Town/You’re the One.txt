But then I met you just when I was losin' hope
You appeared in a cloud of smoke
You don't look like Aaliyah, but you're rockin' my boat
So you can take me to a punk rock paradise
That's about the time I get lost in your eyes
'Cause I want you, I want what you got
Just the thought of it is makin' me hot
So, baby, don't stop
I could have you on the bottom, and you'd still be on top
Just dirty little kids in a crib full of sex toys
Got the walls padded from the back to the front
So me and baby girl can get as loud as we want
Said I love you so much, you dirty little cunt
I like it when you slap me and call me a punk
And for the first time in my life, I said I feel so alive
And my whole life has changed before my very eyes
Love is in the air, you're like the answer to my prayers
All I wanted was a girl that could really take me there
And that ya do, that ya do, that ya do
I must've met a million girls, but I want you
Love is in the air, you're like the answer to my prayers
All I wanted was a girl that could really take me there
And that ya do, that ya do, that ya do
I must've met a million girls, but I want you
You might also likeAnd words can't explain the way I feel inside
You're like my own amusement park, and only I can take a ride
And sex is bliss, sometimes we come home at night
Make love, kiss, hug, drink, drug and fight
And even when I'm wrong, my girl will fuck me 'til I'm right
Kiss me all over, lick me head from toe
Fuck, maybe when we older 'cause I already know
I must have met a million girls, but somethin's different 'bout you
Can't put my finger on one thing, it's everything that you do
I used to see you in the club with your friends
And you'd pretend that you weren't lookin' at me
But I was lookin' at you
I know you look at me and see me as a crook with a brew
Just an everyday player, good looks, tattoos
But let me explain, there's somethin' different 'bout you
You judge a book by its cover, and you're sure to lose
A must have met a million girls, but I want you
Love is in the air, you're like the answer to my prayers
All I wanted was a girl that could really take me there
And that ya do, that ya do, that ya do
I must've met a million girls, but I want you
Love is in the air, you're like the answer to my prayers
All I wanted was a girl that could really take me there
And that ya do, that ya do, that ya do
I must've met a million girls, but I want you
Was it a quiz when I met her, some sort of a test
In a cruel dress, she's eyein' me as if I was blessed
Like an aura trapped me, put me under arrest
Then she slapped me, sentenced to life with no contest
A thug bitch, body like heaven I'm talking classy
Twenty men, breakin' their necks she's walkin' past me
Went to pass it, started to speak, voice was raspy
Heard she was an angel, but sex she liked it nasty
Hit her off late one night, she's lookin' tight
Shorty sippin' her drink to get the vibe just right
Ginuwine is in the stereo finessin' the deck
I put my tongue in her mouth, began caressing her neck
My body shiverin' scared to death I wouldn't impress
Her body quiverin' as I put my palm on her chest
This girl's a treasure, appreciating all of the cat
I'm gettin' pleasure lickin' up the small of her back
Take every measure, had to take all proper precautions
Every single proportion, more fragile than porcelain
She's forcin' a sexual drug, and I'm addicted
Suddenly, I'm feeling bubbly, you got me twisted
Love is in the air, you're like the answer to my prayers
All I wanted was a girl that could really take me there
And that ya do, that ya do, that ya do
I must've met a million girls, but I want you
Love is in the air, you're like the answer to my prayers
All I wanted was a girl that could really take me there
And that ya do, that ya do, that ya do
I must've met a million girls, but I want you
You're the one, you're the one fly girl
You're the one, you're the one for me
I said, you're the one, you're the one fly girl
You're the one, you're the one for me, that's right
You're the one, you're the one fly girl
That's right, you're the one for me
You're the one, you're the one fly girl
