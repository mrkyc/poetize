Now when the shit goes down I'm always forced to grow
Forced to see all the things that I still don't know
And if there's one thing I've learned it's never too late
To take a fucked up life to a beautiful state
'Cause I came from the bottom so I treasure the top
At times it seems the dreams are just a long shot
When the world's crashing down and the drama won't stop
You're chained to the past and you can't break the lock

'Cause nothing could be more beautiful
Than watching the whole world crumbling down on me
So beautiful, so beautiful to witness the end

How far will I go?
And will I grow?
Will I learn to know?

My addiction used to hold me like a lover feeling lonely
I was down by broken dreams and when I felt the world owed me
I'd sit and hit the walls until my fists were cut and swollen
My soul was cold and drowning from the tears I've tried to hold in
Overwhelmed by my emotions and haunted by the past
My head was overheating and my heart was in a cast
My mind was in the gutter, my ass was in a sling
Driven by destruction, young and fucking everything

'Cause nothing could be more beautiful
Than watching the whole world crumbling down on me
So beautiful, so beautiful to witness the end

How far will I go? And will I grow? Will I learn to know?
How far now will I go and will I grow?

Beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful, beautiful

'Cause nothing could be more beautiful
Than watching the whole world crumbling down on me
So beautiful, so beautiful to witness the end
'Cause nothing could be more beautiful
Than watching the whole world crumbling down on me
So beautiful, so beautiful to witness the end
'Cause nothing could be more beautiful (How far will I go?)
Than watching the whole world crumbling down on me (How far will I go?)
