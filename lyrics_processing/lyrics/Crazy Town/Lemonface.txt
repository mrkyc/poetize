Those boys got taste, they go for days
Glassy eyes behind my shades
Tonight's the night I just can't wait
Welcome to LA, we got that bass
We rock those beats, shake your street
Give you lemon face

Sweat drips down the walls of this house
Read my lips, don't want to miss
This is the power of now
They say that this is not allowed
I shut them down, look at me now
I take the blame, turn it around
I got my feet back on the ground

I attack the globe with the powers in my frontal lobe
Mental clips, riddles, rock beats explode
My speech limitless never have to reload
I remain in the game never use a cheat code
Try to put me in a box I love that
I'll put you in a palm box where worms at
Y'all well enough crazy to rush that?

Those boys got taste, they go for days
Glassy eyes behind my shades
Tonight's the night I just can't wait
Welcome to LA, we got that bass
We rock those beats, shake your street
Give you lemon face

Haters going to hate
Fans still appreciate
Genre disintegrate
Fuck it, I'mma deviate
When I'm on the music scene
I roll like a triple beam
Let out the blissful scream
Take this passion cut me clean

Crank the system feel the friction
So loud you just got to listen
We're the ones who become the music
Others call it a public nuisance
Hear the drums drawing no conclusions
And the house we built ain't no illusion
Bang your head to the dirty bass
Turn it up, lemon face
Those boys got taste, they go for days
Glassy eyes behind my shades
Tonight's the night I just can't wait
Welcome to LA, we got that bass
We rock those beats, shake your street
Give you lemon face

When your feet stomp on the ground they make that beautiful sound
When your feet stomp on the ground they make that beautiful sound
You get around I see you there
And I get around and I don't care
I give you

Those boys got taste, they go for days
Glassy eyes behind my shades
Tonight's the night I just can't wait
Welcome to LA, we got that bass
We rock those beats, shake your street
