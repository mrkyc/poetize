Everything is so complex
Everyday is like a test
Full of obstacles that seem almost impossible
And I'm thinkin', just another breath
Not a minute left, how long have I been drifting?
Pass the glass pipe, hit the flash light now break it
People say I'm a star but I still think I'll never make it
And I'm thinkin', just another prayer
Not a second left, I feel there's something missing

Sometimes I hate that chaos surrounds me
When all the answers that I see go around me
Am I drowning, am I fading away
Or am I livin' up to all your dreams that made me this way
Am I drowning, am I drowning?
Am I drowning, am I drowning?

I've been to hell and back lookin' for the answers to life
Lookin' at myself tryin to get things right
And I'm feelin' just another breath
Not a minute left, I feel the darkness lifting
There was a time that I questioned if I'd ever be alright
Runnin' gettin' high, stayin' trapped by sleepless nights
And I'm thinkin', just another breath
Not a minute left I feel there's something missing
I'm running from myself and all the things I don't like
Livin' every night, like it's the last night
And I'm thinkin', just another prayer
Not a second left, I need to stop resisting
You might also like
Sometimes I hate that chaos surrounds me
When all the answers that I see go around me
Am I drowning, am I fading away
Or am I livin' up to all your dreams that made me this way
Am I drowning, am I drowning?
Am I drowning, am I drowning?

Drowning in the drama, lost in the lies
Trapped by the currents of life, caught in the riptide
Drowning in the drama, lost in the lies
Trapped by the currents of life, caught in the riptide
Drowning in the drama, lost in the lies
Trapped by the currents of life, caught in the riptide
Drowning in the drama, lost in the lies
Trapped by the currents of life
Am I drowning, am I drowning?
Am I drowning, am I drowning?

Sometimes I hate that chaos surrounds me
When all the answers that I see go around me
Am I drowning, am I fading away
Or am I livin' up to all your dreams that made me this way
Am I drowning, am I drowning? (Drowning in the drama, lost in the lies)
