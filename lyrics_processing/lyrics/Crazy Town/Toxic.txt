I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it
(T-t-t-t-t-toxic)

Catch a fire, fire it up, corrupt, stirring it up
It's burning hot, drifting, hitting every slot
With a drop kick, it's toxic, trouble like your girl in a mosh pit
I've lost it and that's the only way that we rock shit
Banging heads and ripping threads
If I wasn't rocking shows, I'd be better off dead
With a one-two, one word can destroy your whole crew
And that's toxic, and that's toxic

Toxic, loud and obnoxious
Crazy Town's toxic (with that rock-your-block shit)
Toxic, popping more lip, we love to talk shit
Rocking your block with that straight-out-the-box shit
Toxic!
Toxic, loud and obnoxious
Crazy Town's toxic (with that rock-your-block shit)
Toxic, popping more lip, we love to talk shit
Rocking your block with that straight-out-the-box shit
Toxic!

A Buddha, ballistic, blacklisted, twist of fate
My vocal's fatal, as naughty block concoctions rock your cradle
I thought I'd wait 'til the timing was right to ignite
Cause people like me we only come out at night
I rock the main line and party with fine bitches
Which is a dirty job but somebody's got to do it
So, who's the crew with? More hoes than vivid, lyrics explicit
So, fuck the critics, we leave them hanging like INXS

Toxic thresholds of Colombian gold
You can't roll how we roll, we possess your soul
And push the panic, (is it godly or satanic?)
Toxic or organic? Manic minds refined or frantic
Just the way we planned it, see, we be stomping around the planet
And we stand alone, we infiltrate your chromosomes
No clone, our DNA has got a strain of its own
And it's toxic... (t-t-t-t-t-toxic)
And it's toxic... (I can feel it)
