Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone now
I like how you scream my name till it's early in the morn' now
Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone now
Baby, you don't know
Baby, you don't know

Back in the day
In a downtown loft, lost in our wild ways
Talkin' 'bout money and escalates
But too caught up in the Escapades, uh
Careful what you wish for
'Cause you might get it, boy
All the pretty girls and expensive toys
All I ever wanted was to bring the noise
We're like the Rat Pack with backpacks
Tube socks and fat sacks
Them cool cats that make snaps
With the boom-bap and them phat tracks
And this music's all I know
I can feel it in my bones
I get lost, then it walks me home
Wind me up and watch me go

Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone now
I like how you scream my name till it's early in the morn' now
Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone now
Baby, you don't know (Uh-oh)
Baby, you don't know (Uh-oh)
You might also like
Take me away
I want more of these glory days
If I press replay, would the story change?
I won't walk away
Still got teen spirit like Kurt Cobain
And this elevated music, Brimstone Sluggin' glamourous
We ain't no amateurs, just check the classics backin' us
So back on up, In God we trust
Crazy Town, Los Angeles
Rock the beat like a metro bus
So come on, pick it up, just like you tryin' play it off
'Cause you can't really win until you've ever truly lost

Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone now
Like how you scream my name till it's early in the morn' now
Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone now
Baby, you don't know (Uh-oh)
Baby, you don't know (Uh-oh)
Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone now
Like how you scream my name till it's early in the morn' now
Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone now
Baby, you don't know (Uh-oh)
Baby, you don't know (Uh-oh)
Baby, you don't know
Baby, you don't know
Baby, you don't-

These streets are paved with gold
My eyes wide, my endzone
Time flies, friends go
These memories are like echoes
I've had some, I plan more
These things that we stand for
Crowds wanna raise their hands for
Reasons that I grab my pen for, uh!

This music's my mentor
This here's what I'm meant for
My pen's out, my thoughts pure
They gave me something, now I want more
Rock-Rock it 'til my pocket's full
And I won't stop until I'm over every obstacle
Nothing here's impossible
For the love life, real talk
'Til the morning light, my lip rock
A misfit, thoughts crisscrossed
When the feeling's right, I lift off
Hope in the air, hand on the wheel
I'ma just be patient
I know when I'm on my path, I'ma reach my destination
Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone now
Like how you scream my name till it's early in the morn' now
Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone now
Baby, you don't know (Uh-oh)
Baby, you don't know (Uh-oh)
Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone now
Like how you scream my name till it's early in the morn' now
Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone now
Baby, you don't know (Uh-oh)
