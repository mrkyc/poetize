I know this ain't the ocean, she likes to take of her clothes
Her first name is Deja, her stage name was Rita!
She worked the nightshift at the pussycat theatre!
I brought her round the hood, my homies asked me where cha meet her
Said a movie at the hood, picked her up cause I could
Should of known her fine ass was up to no good
While I was blinded by the fad..
Lil Deja was stacked, to be exact, she got molled back in a Cadillac
Only 17, but she looked around 20
Try to tell me I'm the one, I said I'm one of the many
I said Deja vu what are you trying to do?
You think spreading your legs will make your dreams come true!
Everybody loves you
At least for a day or two
I think I use to fuck you
This is just like Deja vu
And if you give me your number, honey
I'll put you with the other bunny's
It's true
Miss Deja vu! x3
Another good gurl gone bad
Another one bites the dust
She's on dust and needs rehab
The pick of the litter till the whole city hit her
The cream of the crop until she couldn't stop
The kinda gurl you like a lot till you get to know her
Always talking about the people she knows
And how the world owes her..
This lady is just a poser, the perfect example of over exposure
Do you like what you see, well then you need to look closer
Girl I know where ya've been and you'll never be a my girl again
Could of have it all but you took a short cut
Could of had the world but you end up a slut
It hurts when I have to think of all the people you have fucked
You could of slowed your own, but no, you had to push your luck
Running your luck got ya looking like a duck
Young, dumb and immature..ain't no future when you're fucking
Tried to bet it all, fucked them all
But you ended up with nothing
Using sex as a weapon to get what she wants
Like a smith and wesson and she's the flavour of the month
Well it's time to, baby bump and grind like a sex crime
You might also likeFuck that shit, bring in the chorus
Everybody loves you
At least for a day or two
I think I use to fuck you
This is just like Deja vu
And if you give me your number, honey
I'll put you with the other bunny's
It's true
Miss Deja who? x3
Everybody loves you
At least for a day or two
I think I use to fuck you
This is just like Deja vu
And if you give your number honey
I'll put you with the other bunny's
It's true
