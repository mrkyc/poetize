No time for words just choose sides
No fear 'cause no one can hide
No room to keep this inside
I'm on the front line, yellin' out the battle cry!
What?

Steppin' with my Armageddon weapon
I'll wet 'em and let 'em step again
Armageddon weapon will wet 'em again
Steppin' with my Armageddon weapon
I'll wet 'em and let 'em step again
Step again!

I'm sick of waitin' and hearin' this instigation
It's time to take over the station and get y'all pissed off!
It's like my patience is worse than the situation
So I keep a straight face and scream "All of y'all get lost!"
It's not society (Nah), can't beat sobriety (Uh-uh)
Something inside of me is keeping me down
Its 'cause you lie to me and take away my privacy
I used to stay quiet but look at me now!

(No!) No time for words just choose sides!
(No!) No fear 'cause no one can hide!
(No!) No room to keep this inside!
(So where you at?!) Front line, yellin' out the battle cry!
I thought I heard the battle cry!
I could've sworn I heard the battle cry!
I thought I heard the battle cry!
You might also like
(No!) I won't calm down!
(No!) I won't put my firearm down!
(Hell no!) We're either leavin' here or fightin'
Or we're writin' some new rules and I'm doing the writin'!

Who are you to govern me?
How could you govern if you got no fuckin' love for me?
I see the love, but I don't see its brotherly
You love to rape me, hate me, smother me
So I'm gonna be...

Steppin' with my Armageddon weapon
I'll wet 'em and let 'em step again
Armageddon weapon will wet 'em again
Steppin' with my Armageddon weapon
I'll wet 'em and let 'em step again, step again!

(No!) No time for words just choose sides!
(No!) No fear 'cause no one can hide!
(No!) No room to keep this inside!
(So where you at?!) Front line, yellin' out the battle cry!
I thought I heard the battle cry!
I could've sworn I heard the battle cry!
I thought I heard the battle cry!
I used to stay quiet, but look at me now!
I could've sworn I heard the battle cry! (Look at me now!)
I thought I heard the battle cry! (Look at me now!)
