If you got an itch to catch some havoc
There's mayhem in the plastic
City of La La, I mean the land of holy Zsa Zsa
The wood is hot and you can spot the flocks
Of people like sheep, those with dreadlocks
To jocks with Reeboks, fleeing hard rocks
A la cafe, Bambatta flashy fashion
Imagine crashing bashes with bitches
That be bad and wishing for the fame and recognition
They're on a mission for death, baby
We're like the twelve, my tribe is crazy deep
We got the beats that are hot, we're like Clinique
Foundation resonates when I speak
And if by chance, you catch it
Then listen, the wisdom
Epic, open hitting, choking up
You've done it now and woken up
The giant scientist of hits that make you jump like a lunatic
On pogo sticks, waving your fists
So, if you're catching a fit, talking that shit
I don't really know but you better scram, hurry in a double

It goes on (On and on and on)
Hell-raising Hollywood (Welcome to Babylon)
On and on and on and on
The party don't stop ('til the mystery's gone)
It goes on (I've seen it all, I'll see it again)
I shake a lot of hands but I don't got a lot of friends
It goes on (On and on and on)
Hell-raising Hollywood (Welcome to Babylon)
You might also like
We bring it on, bring it on
We trample tromp over Babylon, Babylon
It's arma, it's arma-geddy-on, geddy-on
We have a posse of a million
We take this whole world by storm

Live from the city of lights, sunny days and late nights
Dope, designer drugs, porn stars and bar fights
I drop, makes the bells rock, Mr. Shifty Shellshock
Call me the man of the hour in the land of the lost
Taking the money and the power
CXT, we hold our own, all eyes on us
Crazy rise rain like brimstone, kicking up dust
I grab the mic with a firm hold in a world of shattered goals
Pot holes, broke folks and bank roll
Pole position
Daddy rolling, rolling causing Havoc
So, ready set, I'm more than set
Like Morissette to Maverick
Got it, she's got to have it, habit
Sick, I leave them stuck
I'm getting high for a living, not giving a fuck

It goes on (On and on and on)
Hell-raising Hollywood (Welcome to Babylon)
On and on and on and on
The party don't stop ('til the mystery's gone)
It goes on (I've seen it all, I'll see it again)
I shake a lot of hands but I don't got a lot of friends
It goes on (On and on and on)
Hell-raising Hollywood (Welcome to Babylon)
Doomed to political system, system
Babylon want make us their victim, victim
Open up your ears and listen, listen
We're living in an endless condition

I'm screaming out the call of the wild
I'm speaking in tongues, I am the child of the sun
The power of one
I beat the drums of the Crazy Town click
It's the third eye sitting on the tip
Of the pyramid flipped, now I see a little shotty
Illuminatti (front), dead bodies in my (trunk)
Unraveling the (source), I travel into (self)
You gauge my wage and then you try to debate my wealth
The consequences linger and I'm fingering the perpetrators
Hey yo, my nature was bred on the cross fader
It's the 7th house, Armageddon trudger
Ready for death, It's the Brimstone Slugger!

It goes on (On and on and on)
Hell-raising Hollywood (Welcome to Babylon)
On and on and on and on
The party don't stop ('til the mystery's gone)
It goes on (I've seen it all, I'll see it again)
I shake a lot of hands but I don't got a lot of friends
It goes on (On and on and on)
Hell-raising Hollywood (Welcome to Babylon)
[Interlude: Mad Lion}
I'm gonna burn 'em, burn 'em, burn Babylon
Light up with a torch on a corner now we on
I'm gonna burn 'em, burn 'em, burn Babylon

Hell-raising Hollywood, welcome to Babylon
On and on and on and on
Hell-raising Hollywood, welcome to Babylon
On and on and on and on
Hell-raising Hollywood, welcome to Babylon
On and on and on and on
