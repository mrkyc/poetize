No doubt, I'm the one your mama warned you about
I'm known for taking ladies home and turning them out
Cuz I'd be kissing all the girlies and making them cry
I'm a wise guy with wits, the opposite of shy
Make your girl's pussy shiver when she looks in my eyes
So uh, one's for the money, two's for the honeys
Three's for the pimps, players and the playboy bunnies
You best believe I throw down, ain't no need to slow down
You name the place and the time, find Mr. Shifty at the showdown
Tearing you up
That's why all the fly girls just can't get enough
Said I loved you and you believed it was true
That's hilarious
But your mother should have warned you 'bout guys like us (Uh!)
Freak, freak y'all
Yeah, you know what I'm saying
'Cause players only love you when we're playin'
You might also like
Now players only love you when we're playing (That's right, that's right, come on now)
These women, they will come and they will go (They comin' now)
And all you players know just what I'm saying ()
It's amazing just how many girls we know

I know it ain't right but I don't want to change
I've got so many dames, I can't remember their names
But don't be confused 'cause girls are players too
So, we're going to tell you 'bout a girl we knew
She was a pretty rebel, a punk rock girl
With a wicked sex drive and the mind of a devil
Like Agent 99, undercover all the time
You want another kiss, you better rack another line
Unique in design, this freak was kind of fine
But she's not the only one, there's plenty of her kind
Ain't nothing funny baby, her game's so tight
She can make the sun shine in the middle of the night
She knows what she want and she gets it when she wants it
She knows that you want it, she's got it, so she flaunts it
So get up on it, you know the old saying
Players only love you when they're playing

Now players only love you when we're playing (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, come on now)
These women, they will come and they will go
And all you players know just what I'm saying (Like, like, like this)
It's amazing just how many girls we know (Yeah, like this)
Only the strong survive, I come alive and hit my mark
The after dark player caper, can't lie, I'm on the take
A heartbreaker tonight, the ladies call me Mr. Right
And others call me a freak, girl, it's okay if you bite (Ow)
Some like it violent, Mr. Mysterious type
Strong and silent, king player
I cast a hex
Inebriated talk of sex
Epic, I'm so into you
Oh shit, manipulation
I'm talking triple X rated (Uh-huh)
Sophisticated, I'm game to elevate your mind
An understated flirt (yeah), the chemistry's hot
You can't deny (come on), so realize the size of it (yeah)
I can see it in your eyes, I'd love to touch you lady
And taste the essence of you, you wanna play?
Now, let me hear you scream out my name
Players only love you when they're playin'!

Now players only love you when we're playing (That's right, that's right, come on now)
These women, they will come and they will go (They're comin')
And all you players know just what I'm saying (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, )
It's amazing just how many girls we know (Yeah, yeah)
Now players only love you when we're playing (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
These women, they will come and they will go (Uh-huh, uh-huh, huh, come on now)
And all you players know just what I'm saying (They keep comin' and goin')
It's amazing just how many girls we know (Like this, like this, ya know what I'm sayin')
