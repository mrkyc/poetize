And all I need is just, is just a little more time, a little bit
I said a little more love, a little bit more sunshine
Just a little more would be fine
And all I need is just, is just a little more time, a little bit
I said a little more love, a little bit more sunshine
Just a little more would be fine

I've walked forever down this dusty road
A life of passion, accented by the scent of a rose
And no one said it'd be easy, man, believe me, I know
'Cause it's hard for you to bloom when you need room to grow
So you're never too young, you're never too old
I'm still tryin' to chase the rainbow to my pot of gold
I've seen a lot of the world and I wanna see more
I wanna notice all the things I didn't see before
Life isn't perfect, but I know that it's worth it
I guess I'm just another clown in this so called circus
Tryin' to keep my hustle got my back to the win
I'm trying to make it to the top for some oxygen
Every tatt on my skin, every place that I've been
Every girl that I've lost, I don't know where to begin
It's like, readin' the signs starts to mess with your mind
It looks like love is the drug that gets me every time
You might also like
And all I need is just, is just a little more time, a little bit
I said a little more love, a little bit more sunshine
Just a little more would be fine
And all I need is just, is just a little more time, a little bit
I said a little more love, a little bit more sunshine
Just a little more would be fine

There's too much pressure on my mind
I've been faithful against all signs
If I'm left to go alone, I'm fine
On my way back, I'm gonna take what's mine
It's never too much, could it be love, uh
It's always too much and never enough, gone
Every peak is like a moment of bliss
And then I'm left with just a desperate wish
I'm passionate please, I'm breaking the hex
I'm down on my knees, I'm breaking my neck until there's nothin' left
Caught up with needs and covered with sweat
The simplest things is what we forget (We forget)
I'm spreadin' my wings and leavin' regret
Livin' like kings and losin' our breath
And when the angel sings, I know that it'll be alright, it'll be alright

And all I need is just, is just a little more time, a little bit
I said a little more love, a little bit more sunshine
Just a little more would be fine
And all I need is just, is just a little more time, a little bit
I said a little more love, a little bit more sunshine
Just a little more would be fine
Wishin' on stars and chasin' dreams (Here we go- we go again)
Fallen angels and broken wings (Here we-)
Wishin' on stars and chasin' dreams (Here we go- we go again)
Fallen angels and broken wings

And all I need is just, is just a little more time, a little bit
I said a little more love, a little bit more sunshine
Just a little more would be fine
And all I need is just, is just a little more time, a little bit
I said a little more love, a little bit more sunshine
Just a little more would be fine

I (A little more, little more)
I (A little more, little more)
I (A little more, little more)
