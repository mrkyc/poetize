And it always drives me up the wall
Anytime I'll always risk it all

It's Megatron!
Woah-woah-woah-woah, now let's go!
Woah-woah-woah-woah, oh!
Woah-woah-woah-woah, now let's go!
Woah-woah-woah-woah

I'm breaking away (Way)
Presence like razor blades
A dirty display of rage
Parade of hand grenades
Got something to say (Say)
I've been in the lab for days
My passion just happen to crash into graves
Mechanical action is coming of age

I'm turning the page, perception
Not  but I'm wrecking
Into the ground, I'm loud and I'm proud
My sound is under discretion
No question, I am the future
I'm giving out lessons, I am your tutor
What started a loser, but look at me now
I'm as good as when I was a shooter

It's Megatron!
Woah-woah-woah-woah, now let's go!
Woah-woah-woah-woah, oh!
Woah-woah-woah-woah, now let's go!
Woah-woah-woah-woah
It's Megatron!
Now let's go!
Now let's go!

And everything that has keeping me down is long gone
And everything I ever thought was picking me up was dead wrong
Your sad song has been played, a new dawn
A new day, a new way (Bring it on)

Tragic, dramatic, cut through the static
You're dancing by monsters and voodoo black magic
You'll chase it, you'll never let go once you have it
(You'll chase it, you'll never let go once you have it)

I grab it, I snag it, I fastily drag it through
Run for an hour, then hold it and stab it
And I'll keep passive, this movement is massive
It's Megatron!
Woah-woah-woah-woah, now let's go!
Woah-woah-woah-woah, oh!
Woah-woah-woah-woah, now let's go!
Woah-woah-woah-woah
It's Megatron!
Now let's go!
Now let's go!

We make an impression-n-n-n
'Cause we're the exception-n-n-n
This is the sound of Crazy Town (The resurrection)
Subliminal, criminal, digital grace
Spiritual, physical, setting the pace
The damage is done (Done)
We gave you a chance to run

But instead, you stayed and now you're getting crazy
All the girls they wanna be my sugar baby
But instead, you stayed and now you're getting crazy
All the girls they wanna...

It's Megatron!
Woah-woah-woah-woah, now let's go!
Woah-woah-woah-woah, oh!
Woah-woah-woah-woah, now let's go!
Woah-woah-woah-woah
It's Megatron!
Now let's go!
