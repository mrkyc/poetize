Now in these cynical times are sterotypical minds
Got me falling from my pinnacle the minute i climb
Now these subliminal thoughts got individuals blind
I'm trying to look beyond the lies just to see what i'll find
I'm like a flower in a cave another hour in the maze
I'll cower to the power of my criminal ways
The sun is shining but I'm catching minimal rays
It's time for me to bloom out of this childish phase
My life is like a battle that I'll probably never win
Cause I keep thinking big and risking everything
Life's a challenge and I wonder if I'll ever find the balance
Mixed emotions and confusion topped off with many talents

Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever change
Can I change, would I change or am I always gonna be the same?
I blame the world for making me such a freak
But the world wants to blame it on me (My life is twisted)
Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever change
Can I change, would I change or am I always gonna be the same?
I blame the world for making me such a freak
But the world wants to blame it on me (My life is twisted)

My fingers pointing in the mirror, I'm the one now (one now)
I see my shadow in the sun dial (sun dial)
Am I really out of change, put my freedom in a cage
Slow down, man I got a son now
It's nothing new they all said it, and I knew it
But I had to go through it myself, I'm hard headed
But that's the only way that I learn
Get caught in the fire there's no escaping the burn (and it burns)
Change this change that, change is full of lies
I remain the same cat, wear a good disguise
Living life looking through my third blind crooked eye
So if I change I'd be changing for the worst wouldn't I?

I wanna run but if i run I'm only running from myself
Would it be easier if i was someone else? (Changes)
I'm like a child playing with matches that's never been burned
Relearning all the lessons that i've already learned
(On a highway) To a destination i've earned
(So many exits) But I never bothered to turn I'm like a piece of shard glass
Laying on the frame of a window that was broken by the bricks of pain
Sometimes I feel just like the devil's guinea pig
He's watching me just to see how deep I can dig
I admit I'm fucked up and got a lot to learn
So I'm dancing in the ashes of the bridges I burn

Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever change

Will i ever change (Can I)
