Ay!
It never could be anything like
It never could be anything like
I'm brought up from the ashes (Look at that!)

The wheels keep spinnin'
We gonna kill it, this is monster and I got this feeling
Cold blooded aftertaste is coming up
It's nothing nice, we up all night gonna get it right
After everything I've done before
We keep it reelin'
So put your hands up to the ceilin', that mass appealin'
With ratchet beats that keep concealin'
The underline, the get it right, gonna let it ride
Gonna hit it 'til we overflow

Oh!
Seen it all around the world
Never gonna live it down
Almost let it fall away
Now we're brought up from the ashes
Oh!
Seen it all around the world
Never gonna live it down
Almost let it fall away
And we're brought up from the ashes

Ch-ch-check this out!
Seen it all around the world
Look at- look at- look at that...

Haters be countin' me out
Talkin' and runnin' their mouths
Enemies callin' me out
Reachin' and pullin' me down
Tell me you've figured me out
Tell me I'm stuck, now I'm calling you out
Half of the reason I'm back for the season
Is giving you something to stick in your mouth
Resurrection, this mic is my protection
This gun is decoration and I got a whole collection
The devil's real
I've seen him before, he gave me a deal
Never again will I give him my life
Now come to my throne and kneel (Kneel)

Oh!
Seen it all around the world
Never gonna live it down
Almost let it fall away
Now we're brought up from the ashes
Oh!
Seen it all around the world
Never gonna live it down
Almost let it fall away
And we're brought up from the ashes
Resurrection, this mic is my protection
Tell me you've figured me out
Half of the reason I'm back for the season
Is giving you something to stick in your mouth (Look at that)

Oh!
Seen it all around the world
Never gonna live it down
Almost let it fall away
Now we're brought up from the ashes
Oh!
Seen it all around the world
Never gonna live it down
Almost let it fall away
And we're brought up from the ashes
