Some nights when i get bored, I like to go out to bars and play the piano
Take some shots of whiskey, smoke a cigarette, and fuckin' rock the house

OK,  Spidey sense is tingling, I'm intense with mingling
World's a crazy circus but we're brothers like the wringlings
Chew these rappers up and spit 'em out like gum from Wrigley's
Sorta like a hoarder but I'm shorter than a pigmy
Just cause I'm from Canada don't mean I live in igloos
Soon as I'm allowed back in the states I will be big news
I'm getting old but still in line, like it was last call
I'm getting colder with these lines and I got glass balls
Seems like being a pussy is in style, and wearing flouresent
I'm a dwarf more aggressive with a warped message
Walking through a cavern with a torch lit
Rather be an underground rapper then full of horse shit
I chop these rappers up and eat 'em like slaw salad
This is raw talent, still a little off balance
I am cold as ice spitting vocal poltergeist
Listen to the words I'm saying close, I'm giving bold advice

You really don't know what it means. When I hand you the keys
You overlooking like it's overhead
It's sure to bring you down on your knees, take it when we give it, Cause we gunnin' like we Boba Fett
Real I've always been, real I'll always be
So real in fact my haters even respect me
You really don't know what it means when I hand you the keys
When I hand you the keys

I'm crazy c-crazy crazy ,this jacket can't restrain me
Insane in the brain they label me when i was just a baby
Playing with chains, skulls and spikes
The chain go on the bike, the bikes going with me and
We can go if you like
Masked with the hoodies in the hood, he taking goodies door to door like a girl scout
Daily panicking, a mannequin, they say the dark brought him
Born on the floor but they call it rock bottom
Got to keep it real to know that
What about some sanity and my dealers sold that
Is anybody listening, I fought a whole war
No army, no enlisting, and I'm back no visiting
Rap so cinnamon, too soft and they spit it whack, no penmanship, 4000 degrees, and I'm in it to my knees 'cause I'm so shifty please

You really don't know what it means. When I hand you the keys
You overlooking like it's overhead
It's sure to bring you down on your knees, take it when we give it, Cause we gunnin' like we Boba Fett
Real I've always been, real I'll always be
So real in fact my haters even respect me
You really don't know what it means when I hand you the keys
When I hand you the keys

Chaotic, psychotic, you want it i got it
I'm a peddler deadlier a style of malaria fuck competitors
Tales of H.G. Wells, my time machine will stay ahead of ya
And I been there, I did that platinum plaque stacks etc.,
My past is the beginning of your beginning and the beginning of all that is
And has been, since the twilight of the dawn, I'm not kidding
I was mad work in the lab, I can show you how to do this
Epic work epic when but imma Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis
Clueless for you to diss, I'll strangle you until your blueish
So much juggling, struggling that Imma get it done
Only thing I do better is be a father to my son
And I can battle on, babble on, until we end up in Babylon
Notes to notebook, I hold the keys touch a grammar tongue
Notes your hopes up I bought the seas that I walk upon
And when everything is feeling shaky, it's that 808
Heh heh I rip the head off, fuck that dumb shit Imma demonstrate
You really don't know what it means. When I hand you the keys
You overlooking like it's overhead
It's sure to bring you down on your knees, take it when we give it, Cause we gunnin' like we Boba Fett
Real I've always been, real I'll always be
So real in fact my haters even respect me
