G-g-g-g-g-g-get up

I'm driven by my indecision
It'll be safer just to walk away
I'm not looking for a real commitment
I'm not looking for a place to stay
'Cause this is were the freaks come out
Iwon't hold on, but hold you down
So we don't have to fall in love
I'm only gonna let you down

Come inside
Oh, it's just another way for me to tell you
What's under the surface
And what it's really like
So just hold it
I am broken on the inside too
With you, I'm alive

I feel like I should reach to touch you
Tell me what I see is real
I wish I had the guts to trust you
I wish you knew the way I feel
I am just a broken toy
You're dancin' with a broken boy
I think you'd better save yourself
Put me back up on the shelf and...
You might also like
Come inside
Oh, it's just another way for me to tell you
What's under the surface
And what it's really like
So just hold it
I am broken on the inside too
With you, I'm alive

I'm living on intuition
Floatin' on borrowed time
Tied up in the contradiction
Messin' with my state of mind
And baby, you're the only real thing
I know that I would call you mine
I'm livin' in my addiction
So baby, just let me...
Come inside
Oh, it's just another way for me to tell you
Come inside
Oh, it's just another way for me to tell you (With you, I'm alive)

I'm so complexed
That knows me next
I wanna let you go, but I'm so obsessed
And you're so complexed
You knows me next
I'm stuck on you and have to confess
Just say yes
Just say yes
Just say yes
Just say yes
Come inside
Oh, it's just another way for me to tell you
What's under the surface
And what it's really like
So just hold it
I am broken on the inside too
With you, I'm alive

I'm broken inside
I'm broken, I'm broken
I'm broken inside
