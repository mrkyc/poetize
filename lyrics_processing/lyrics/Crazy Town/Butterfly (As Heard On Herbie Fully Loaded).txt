You're my butterfly sugar baby
Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
Such a sexy, sexy, pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So, to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and the looks to kill
Time is passing, I'm asking, "Could this be real?"
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so, yo, I'm putting it down
Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy
Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy
You might also likeI don't deserve you
Unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious then I guess it's true
But to tell the truth, I really never knew till I met you
See, I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was living like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash, parole, the police files
So, yo
What's happening now?
I see the sun breaking down a few dark clouds
And a vision of you standing out in a crowd, so
Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy
Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy
Hey, sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, it's me and you like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talk about butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see, it don't get better than this
So, butterfly, here is a song
And it's sealed with a kiss and a "Thank you, miss."
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So, come and dance with me, uh-huh, uh-huh
Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy
Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy
Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy
Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me, uh-huh, uh-huh
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
