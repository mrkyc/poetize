Reconnect the tone
Electric microphone
K-Kinetic, call alone
The Epic chromosome
Don't sweat it, here's the zone
I feel it in my bones
Welcome to my place

Live from LA, playa Hollyhood
We're the best from the west, we're from Hollywood
And I highly could and probably should
She a dirty bit, but ya'll, she got all the goods
Better pack your bag, girl, just in case
'Cause every video needs a pretty face
And if you wanna bring your friend, girl, that's okay
Let's go back to my place

So come on baby, come on back to my place
Don't say maybe, can't say no to this face
'Cause you don't know it, but you're about to lose control
So let's go

Disconnect the phone
Top secret overtones
My beat is off the chain
The words express the pain
Girl, your brain's on overload
Way too much to take alone
Welcome to my place

Now I got a love shack, you can take the key
When I watch your body, it talks to me
Well we can hit my crib, gonna have a kiss
I'm 'bout to dip out the club with a badass bitch
Put some more  on the mattress
Sorry, but you know that's the way it is
And like Eazy-E's known for the Jheri Curl
You know as tattooed boys, we get all the girls

So come on baby, come on back to my place
Don't say maybe, can't say no to this face
'Cause you don't know it, but you're about to lose control
So let's go
So come on baby, come on back to my place
Don't say maybe, can't say no to this face
So you don't know it, but you're about to lose control
So let's go, let's go!

It's so digital
Instead of physical
Extraterrestrial
Turn up the stereo
It's like that type of thing that leaves you wonderin'
Welcome to my place (My place)
So come on baby, come on back to my place
Don't say maybe, can't say no to this face
'Cause you don't know it, but you're about to lose control
So let's go
So come on baby, come on back to my place
Don't say maybe, can't say no to this face
'Cause you don't know it, but you're about to lose control
