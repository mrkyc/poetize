I'll give 'em hell, rebel yell and you getting stuck pal
That's how it is, word to your miss
I'm milky like  and you can ass-kiss
Take the gloves off, I'll never run or duck a challenge
Never was soft, it just so happens that my origin is Brooklyn baby
Lookin' crazy if I'm tired cause my eye's lazy
I won't forget it cause I'm Epic in the way I said it
I got you open and you hoping that it's copacetic
The  will catch you  I'll leave you with the way you sweat it
I hope you backing up your words because I know you said it
I fucking know you said it
You better come through ten deep, and through the heat
Come with anything less than that and son you're getting beat
Don't sleep, I'm hard like concrete and playing for keeps
The dirty  dirty cheap
I'll give you something to step to
Suck on my gun
No-one can come to your rescue
No need to run
Cause sooner or later we'll get you
Suck on my gun
Don't get it twisted or confused
(There's nowhere to run)
I'll give you something to step to
Suck on my gun
No-one can come to your rescue
No need to run
Cause sooner or later we'll get you
Suck on my gun
Don't get it twisted or confused
There's nowhere to run
You might also likeYour shit had been ready, but now it's too late
The click is so heavy Dirty reside in two states
Some say we ain't steady cause when these minds collaborate
We sink in the seats of a Lincoln, pistols navigate
We stay damaging sets and brothers who be rebelling threats
Cannibalistic with this like Hannibal Lec--
I'm like a loan shark handling tec's
Breaking brothers like they ain't paid their gambling debts
I'm a big dog, on a short chain
Four pounds of love leaves a red stain
I put a tec to the neck, love to catch wreck
Come through, guns drew, getting respect
Who won't come to split you?
You get me mad that I'sa get the slums to get you
Make it bad enough that guns will have to numb the pistol
It's the saddest stuff
Cause now you got tons of issues
It was fun again
But you don't want to start this 
I bring friction like 
Mess around and you'll get more than you could withstand
Chinese water torture in quicksand
I'll give you something to step to
Suck on my gun
No-one can come to your rescue
No need to run
Cause sooner or later we'll get you
Suck on my gun
Don't get it twisted or confused
(There's nowhere to run)
I'll give you something to step to
Suck on my gun
No-one can come to your rescue
No need to run
Cause sooner or later we'll get you
Suck on my gun
Don't get it twisted or confused
There's nowhere to run
Got you staring down the barrel of a gun
I'm thinking should I pistol whip
You one and make today your lucky one
Or should I pull the fucking trigger and call out the gravedigger
Got my gun out, so back on up and let the crome blow, get blown out
Kill that get clapped head crack
Dime sack, 31 syndicate, uh, I rep that
Suck on my gun, get on your knees
I'm goin' kill anybody fucking with me
Talking about me
Cause they can't compete, shot block, shell shock and the CXT
I give you something to step too
Suck on my gun, no one can come to your resuce
No need to run, because sooner or later we'll get you
Suck on my gun, dont get twisted or confused
(Theres no where to run)
I give you something to step too
Suck on my gun, no one can come to your rescue
No need to run, because sooner or later we'll get you
Suck on my gun, dont get twisted or confused
Theres no where to run
And there you have it, the  shot blockers
Epic, Shifty, ezack, danny boy, 
, The dirty unit, thats how we do it
Mmmmm...
Suck on this gun...
