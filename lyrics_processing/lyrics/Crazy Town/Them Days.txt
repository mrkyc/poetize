Tell me how you like us now
I remember the days we used to stop and watch and drop the drops
But now we got the block unlocked with lots of props
No longer do we shock the rocks and cock the Glock
So how ya like us now?
We used to be broke, now we coppin shifts
We used to make demos, but now we droppin' hits
Had a block on the phone, but now we got flips
If you wanna catch me, you better hit me on the head
I used to be the dope man, supplying the coke, man
But now I slang CDs and I'm still the dope man
Smokes man comin' up, we used to have people runnin' up
Fuck a bodyguard, I'll break your face if you're dumb enough
Leave ya lip numb enough, bleedin' from the gum and up
You've heard of us, we ain't no murderous, but there's a turn of us
We used to chase girls, and now they're wantin' us
Used to lace girls, but now they're turnin' us
Spinin' huns on us, droppin' funds on us
We used to chase girls, but now they're chasin' us
We used to live the ouih life, and now we live the good life
Don't run the label, but we runnin' it like Suge Knight
I remember the days we used to stop and watch and drop the drops
But now we got the block unlocked with lots of props
No longer do we shock the rocks and cock the Glock
So how ya like us now?

Tell me how you like us now
Tell me, tell me
Tell me how you like us now
We came up by doin' the same stuff
When we was rappin', you was hatin', now you wanna change up
'Cause you see we platinum chain up
You had the same chances we had and rode the same bus
Now you wanna blame us, 'cause you're nameless
We used to have the same damn problem, now we're famous
I used to have a bus pass, now I push a Cadillac
We used to have no cheese, now we got too much cash
We used to get no play, now we in rotation
I used to rock my CDs on a Sony PlayStation
I used to be shy, now I'm outgoin'
Used to be a nice guy, but now I'm out hoein'
I used to like people, now I got an ego
When I was comin' up, society didn't treat me equal
The ladies used to play us, and treat us like some suckas
But now that we got money, we're some sexy mothafuckas
They wanted to be my lover, said I was too nasty
Now they wanna flash me, and sexually harass me
I used to rock the timex, but now I don't recommend them
'Cause now I got the platinum, only with the diamonds in 'em
Come here, check this shit out
Bling bling
