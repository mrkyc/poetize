Yeah
These niggas is lame, they doin' the same
Switch the game, I gave it some breath
Then gave it a heart, then gave it a brain
And now it's a monster, and I'm a monster
So we get along, I'm doing my thing bitch
I'm killing these niggas, on every song, yeah
Welcome to I5 fly high in the sky dive
I dream good, wake up to a high five
Yeah, Fly World or fuck the world
All we do is count more money and fuck with girls
Fliest, try this, baby are you high yet, huh?
I guess a better question, are you fly yet?
Dreaming, scheming on how we could make a mil this evening
Top of the building killing shit, motherfucker we dreaming
Yeah, motherfucker we dreamers
And we won't let this dream end
Live like a weekend, peeking, but no, nigga can't stay though
Aye yo I'm on my busy countin' Play-doh money, boy

I'm so high as a tree, if it ain't superman, who the fuck could it be?
I'm talking bout that ghetto jamming, alpine slamming
Make the whole crowd look at me, yeah
You might also like
(Huh)
If I wasn't here, the sky would fall
And the top is where I'm diving off
These niggas ain't dope, they Tylenol
And every car that we drive is tall
So why in the fuck would we ride with y'all
Lamers, lets talk when you talking payments
2 decks or more, fresh off a tour, so I'm Jacuzzi bathing
Hamptons, sweet sand, ATL for the weekend
And who's that peeking in my window (WOW)
How they get this high?
Them niggas probably could fly
We look up out the window and wave, tell them bye-bye
Nigga, see we been stylin' since stylin' been stylin'
Jetsettin', jump from island to island to island
Murderin' this motherfucker, boy
Now add that up and tell me what it's worth, boy
Versace shirts and new toys
The world is our playground, she stay round
Tell her hop in and stay down

I'm so high as a tree, if it ain't superman, who the fuck could it be?
I'm talking bout that ghetto jamming, alpine slamming
