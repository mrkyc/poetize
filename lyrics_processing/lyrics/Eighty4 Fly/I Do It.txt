Holla I'm on my BI
Just come to Seattle and then maybe you can see why
I call myself the king, I guess I'm on my T.I
Up and down Aurora ridin' slower than a P.I
Teal turn up the bass make it pound right
You wanna rep a city right, then I'm who you should sound like
Nigga I ain't lying, I'm the truest
Don't believe me, let me tell you why I do it
Bitch

I do it for myself, I do it for the city
I do it for them girls on the beaches lookin' pretty
I do it for the music, I do it for the clothes
I do it for the pimps and I do it for the hoes
I do it for the bottles, the drinks, the lights
I do this shit for y'all cause I do this shit right
I do it for my family, I do it for the stage
I do it for the love and I do it for the pay

Sucka niggas wanna kill a dream
So I hope they witness everything
I hope they see me stuntin' in that black on black
Or white on white, it cost some racks on racks on racks on racks
Everything I do, I do it for my fam
I'd live the worst do they can live the best they can
Told my mom I was special, I'mma prove it
So if anybody asks her why I do it
She can tell them

So I guess this is the end though
Don't forget to press rewind and ash your Indo
Told you I'm a winner and I been dope
But I'm not scared of losing cause I been broke
So if I do, I guess i'll just get rich again
Another day, another dollar, there's no stopping him
There may have been confusion in the past
But this is why I do it if you ask
Boy
