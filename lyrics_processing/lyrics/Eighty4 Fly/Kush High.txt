Beach front villa cost a lot of scrilla
Same for that foreign gas tank I fill up
And honestly this whole tape sounds like a classic
All its missing is its thrilla
Single mingle with the stars
Im suppose to be in jail I'm just looking at the odd's
I must of beat um defeated um'
And them nay sayers we never needed um'
This is what a kush high sounds like
Bad bitch up in the back twisting sound bytes
So smoke it down and po' it up
See them flyworld chains then you know its us
Niggas walking in like the owners
Smelling like that cause I'm in with the stoners
Waking up on earth didn't sound right
Cause when you wake up in flyworld it sounds like

Oowhoa oowhoa ooooowhoa
Oowhoa oowhoa ooooowhoa

She told me see you when you get here
My dad told me I should give it time
I told him ima make it this year
Keja told me have some class pour it in a glass
Every bodies watching you its time to show your asssssssss
I told her you know how I does it
Owning this bitch like its nothing nothing
Bottles of that Cliquo our it in a chalice
Been the king for years all I needs a palace
And a queen bad bitches shoot the resume
They always come they never stay
And this right heres a victory a victory seattle got one and this is me
Waking up on earth didn't sound right
Cause when you wake up in flyworld it sounds like

Oowhoa oowhoa ooooowhoa
Oowhoa oowhoa ooooowhoa
