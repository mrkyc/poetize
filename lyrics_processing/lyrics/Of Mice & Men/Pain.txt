I am sick of this place of death
With a pace that's set
And you know the pessimistic bend
Just to watch you break
Practice what you preach
Separate skin from the bone
Digging at my flesh
Like a schizophrenic with a blade
Fingers tracing scars
Mapping out reminders of just how much I can take

Pressure in my brain, my shoulders take the weight
Back's about to break
(Back's about to break, back's about to break)

Pain, every day that I awake
In my blood and through my veins
Now there's nothing left that you can take away from me
Pain (Pain)

Because I've seen it before
I've lived it before, I've been there before
Incarnate, so don't you ever underestimate me
Daily death crooning in my ear
Things I wanna hear, turn my head and bite my tongue
Spitting blood on my pre-determined grave
This is all a game
You might also like
Pressure in my brain, my shoulders take the weight
Back's about to break, this is all a game

Pain, every day that I awake
In my blood and through my veins
Now there's nothing left that you can take away from me
Pain, every day that I awake
In my blood and through my veins
Now there's nothing left, nothing left that you can take from me


(Pain, pain, pain, pain)
Footprints in the sand that can't be washed away
It breeds while we're asleep, it feeds when we awake
Burdens of the flesh, our bodies are so weak
We seek the spirit's truth, to turn the other cheek

Turning the other cheek to see a world broken, lost and vain
(Pain, pain, pain, pain)
How can you ever look at someone else the same way?
We all bleed (Pain, pain, pain, pain)
The human race have some empathy, we are all in pain
If we commiserate, then we can share the weight
We are all the same, we are all in...
Pain, every day that I awake
In my blood and through my veins
Now there's nothing left that you can take away from me
Pain, every day that I awake
In my blood and through my veins
