Get up, blegh!
And here we go!

Now listen up I'll say a thing or two
I bet I know something about you
That you don't even know
You don't wanna believe
I know you're down for anything
That's not what you're looking for
There's not a reason to walk out that door
And I don't even want you to sing
I just want you to jump with me

I'm so complicated, my body's failing
I think I've hit the floor, I cannot feel anything anymore
My body's failing, I think I've hit the floor
I can't remember anything anymore
And I'm gonna miss your face for a long, long time (For a long, long time)
And I can't escape this place, it's in my mind ('Cause it's in my mind)

And now that you don't even care
I've got you inside the palm of my hand
You don't really wanna get inside my head
Let's leave out all our skeletons
The dead just like you will rise
So come on, lift your voices towards the sky
Now I want you to jump, now I want you to sing
Now I want you to scream with me!

I've been put down for way too long
"You'll never be good enough"
All they told me was, "Just give up
You'll never be good enough"
I've been put down for way too long
"You'll never be good enough."
All they told me was, "Just give up
You'll never be good enough, never good enough"
Pushing me, pushing me
Shut up, shut up
I'm gonna miss your face
I'm gonna miss your taste
I'm gonna miss your face
It's in my mind...
I'm gonna miss your face
I'm gonna miss your taste
I'm gonna miss your face
It's all in my mind

My body's failing, I think I've hit the floor
I cannot feel anything anymore
My body's failing, I think I've hit the floor
