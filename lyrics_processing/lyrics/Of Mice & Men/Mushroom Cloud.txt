Go

Yeah, have you ever felt the chains of life around your wrist?
When it shoves the grenade right in your mouth, then pulls the pin?
And do you really know just what it's like to never fucking sleep?
Or what it's like to remind yourself that
The voices don't pull the strings?

They're not real to you, but they're real to me
I know I'm spiraling, I'm just waiting to detonate

Three, two, one, boom
Countdown to insanity
Three, two, one, boom
Ignite the fuse and immolate
Three, two, one, boom
I've got a mind like a mushroom cloud
I'll either perish in the flames or be frozen in the fallout

Can someone sound the alarm?
Can someone sound the alarm?
This is not a test, this is not a test
I repeat this is not a test
You might also like
Does anyone hear the screaming
From the Trojan horse burning inside of my head?
If hell is really empty
Then maybe the demons found a home in there instead

They're not real to you, but they're real to me
And they set my mind ablaze every time that I detonate

Three, two, one, boom
Countdown to insanity
Three, two, one, boom
Ignite the fuse and immolate
Three, two, one, boom
I've got a mind like a mushroom cloud
I'll either perish in the flames or be frozen in the fallout

I am in control, I am in control
I am in control, I am in control
I am in control, I am in control
I am in control, I am in control
I am in control, I am in control
But where do you hide
When the thoughts running through your mind trip?
Where do you hide
When the thoughts running through your head trip the landmine?
Boom
Boom
I've got a mind like a mushroom cloud
I've got a mind like a mushroom cloud
