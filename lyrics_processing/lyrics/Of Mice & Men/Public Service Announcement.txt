You all have something to say, or something to ask
I don't live in a cage, it's none of your business
You all have something to say, or something to ask
I don't live in a cage, it's none of your business
It's none of your business

Gonna say this clear so you get it straight
You don't know a thing about me
Who I am from what I read, oh, I sound so sickening
Your attempts to bring me down, fuel my fire and build my sound
I can't believe all the things I hear

You all have something to say about me
How can you stop and listen, when all you do is talk?
You all have something you want to take from me
And I can't hold my tongue anymore
Shut up
You all have something that you want to say to me
You all have something to ask
It's none of your business
It's none of your business

I'm well aware I did three days alone in a cell
A simple, easy price to pay for something that I felt
Towards someone so deserving
I hate those who prey on the weak
If asked to do it all again, I would if needed be
You might also like
All of these people talking about my story
As if they've lived it before
All of these people they don't even know me
But I love how you think you know me better than I know myself
You know me better than myself
Than myself
Than myself

You all have something to say, or something to ask
I don't live in a cage, it's none of your business
It's none of your business

All of these people, talking about my story
Just keep talking, just keep talking
It's none of your business
You all have something to say about me
You all have something to ask
It's none of your business
You all have something to say about me
You all have something to ask
