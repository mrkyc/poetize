Even though I can see it in your face, I can't barely explain
Just how broken and empty and disgraced you seem to be (To be)
You cut me out and dragged me down
Pulled me all the way to the bottom
I've done for you 'til black and blue
What no one else would do for the fallen

One day when nothing ever feels the same
Just like every other time before
You hit the wall, lost it all
And I'll find a way to wake you from this bed you've made
Even though I know you want me to
I'm never giving up on you! (On you, on you)
I'm never giving up, never giving up on you! (On you, on you)
I'm never giving up, I'm never giving up on you!

You'll never know just how hard it is for me
To see you this way
It tears me up, and drags me down
Trying to pull you up from the bottom
I break for you, like I always do
And I'll see you through
When you're on your knees and crawling. (Crawling!)

One day when nothing ever feels the same
Just like every other time before
You hit the wall, lost it all
And I'll find a way to wake you from this bed you've made
Even though I know you want me to
I'm never giving up on you! (On you, on you)
I'm never giving up, never giving up on you! (On you, on you)
I'm never giving up, I'm never giving up on you!

So don't give up on me!
Yeah! Don't you give up on me! (Give up on me)
Yeah! Don't you give up on me!
Yeah! Don't you give up on me!

One day when nothing ever feels the same
Just like every other time before
You hit the wall, lost it all
And I'll find a way to wake you from this bed you've made
Even though I know you want me to
I'm never giving up on you! (On you, on you)
I'm never giving up, never giving up on you! (On you, on you)
I'm never giving up, I'm never giving up on you!
