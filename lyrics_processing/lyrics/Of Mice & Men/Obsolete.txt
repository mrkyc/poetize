Urgh, obsolete

Yeah!

For a thousand days, I watched the vultures circle overhead
And I counted the ways the world would
Be blessed when I finally reached my end
And I felt the weight of the world pushing me into the soil below
And I felt the desert sun above
While I tried to drink water from a stone

But I'm not ready to die alone

So can you wake me from my sleep
And show me now that this is just a dream?
'Cause I'm a whisper, once a scream
And I'm afraid of what's in store for me
Becoming obsolete

Become obsolete
Become obsolete, urgh!
You might also like
Another frozen frame, another glitch inside my consciousness
So I pick my poison and just choke it down until I start to spin
And while the world just slowly turns, I fade like fog into the sea
While the mighty galleon burns around me, I slowly start to sink

Urgh, maybe I'm not ready to be set free
Maybe these shackles are what I need
If you find the answers, come rescue me
But I can't hold my breath

So can you wake me from my sleep
And show me now that this is just a dream?
'Cause I'm a whisper, once a scream
And I'm afraid of what's in store for me
Becoming obsolete

(Becoming obsolete)
Maybe I'm not ready to be set free
Maybe these shackles are what I need
If you find the answers, come rescue me
If you find the answers, come rescue me
So can you wake me from my sleep
And show me now that this is just a dream?
'Cause I'm a whisper, once a scream
And I'm afraid of what's in store for me
Becoming obsolete

Become obsolete
Become obsolete
Become obsolete
Become obsolete
