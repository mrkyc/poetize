Oh, shawty do di do (hey baby)
Oh, shawty do di do (hey shawty)
Oh, shawty do di do (hey baby)
Oh, shawty do di do

Can't believe I missed ya
Starin' at ya picture
Laying under covers, I'm hurting cause I ain't with cha' baby (oh, oh, hey)
You got everything moving slow...(hey hey hey)

See I got a lot of girls that ain't that fly
Who you wanna call (got too much pride)
But I can't get enough of your pretty brown eyes
I can't seem to shake it off because shawty you turn me on
What you doin' just ain't right
Baby please don't take me wrong

Cause I can't get you off of my brain
And everything I hear sounds like your name
I always think I'm sprung
But I don't care, I just want you here, cause
I can't get you off of my head
Like a snapback (like a snapback)
I can't get you off of my head
Like a snapback (like a snapback)
I can't get you off of my head
Like a snapback (like a snapback)
I can't get you off of my head
Like a snapback (like a snapback)
You might also like
You take over my thinkin'
I see you when I'm dreamin'
I don't mess with them drugs
But your love's got me feining (baby, ohh)
(hey) you got everything movin' slow (yeah, yeah, yeah)



I gotta get back to the heart of my lady
I'm gonna go hard at it no if, ands, or maybes
I don't care what it takes
Imma prove I'm the best
My trunk game tight and my swag so fresh
I move it like a G that fact you can't deny
You can search all over the world but you won't find another guy
There other girls keep on streein' me , pressin' me, and textin' me
But you the only one for me
I just wish that you could see that
