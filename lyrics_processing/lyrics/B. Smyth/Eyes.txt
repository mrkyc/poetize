I keep my eyes on you
But I still hide from you
Girl, you know that I keep my eyes on you?
I need fake pages just to lurk on you

Baby I don't wanna slip up, hit the like button
I'm creepin', nine weeks in, no sleepin'
These weepin' eyes on you
Girl, you know that I keep my eyes on you?
We've already got five whole years
Almost to the day, I heard you tell that it was eight
Man, I almost lost my way
See you got that job and you workin' out
Inches comin' in and your booty on swole

I keep my eyes on you
But I still hide from you
Girl, you know that I keep my eyes on you?
I need fake pages just to lurk on you
Oh, these weepin' eyes on you
But I still hide from you, (yeah)
Know that I'm on this phone right now
Wonderin' why I'm alone right now

All these fucking comments he's been leaving
I've been, seeing he's been in your recents
What's the reason'?
We ain't talk since seventeen on new years eve but
I know that it's open season I can't even
Girl, it's clear that I don't want you to know
Too much pride to let go
But I'm watchin', can't let it show, no
But I understand, you need space
I done made way more than a mistake
Got me all caught up all on your page!

I keep my eyes on you
But I still hide from you

I need fake pages just to lurk on you
Oh, these ... eyes on you
But I still hide from you, (yeah)
