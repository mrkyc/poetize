When we started out it was all good, thought we were in love
Thought you were the one for me
But then you switched out, changed up, what the hell went wrong?
Now I'm singing this song, can't believe it
Gave you everything you could ask for, but it wasn't enough, you wanted more
How could you be so cold, girl, how could you be so cold?
Tricking off on me, all the homies told me you was wrong
Now you can be gone, get to leaving
Cause all of this was for you, but you took my love and threw
It all, it all away, but it, but it's okay
Got somebody else to take your place

I'm in my goochie zone, zone
Girl, I ain't tripping, I'mma do my thing
I'm in my goochie zone, zone
I'm turnt up about a hundred degrees
I'm good, I'm goochie
I'm good, I'm goochie
I'm good, I'm goochie
I'm good, I'm goochie
I'm in my goochie zone, zone
Hands up if you rolling with me
You might also like
I'm on now, moved on
Now the tables turned, now she all concerned with me, yea
But it's too late, I'm long gone, ain't looking back
She a thing of the past, I don't need it

Cause all of this was for you, but you took my love and threw
It all, it all away, but it, but it's okay
Got somebody else to take your place

I'm in my goochie zone, zone
Girl, I ain't tripping, I'mma do my thing
I'm in my goochie zone, zone
I'm turnt up about a hundred degrees
I'm good, I'm goochie
I'm good, I'm goochie
I'm good, I'm goochie
I'm good, I'm goochie
I'm in my goochie zone, zone
Hands up if you rolling with me
I'm on my own, doing my thing
All these women in my lane
See, I tried to love you baby
But you played me, it's a shame
I'm on my own, doing my thing
All these women in my lane
See, I tried to love you baby
But you played me, it's a shame
I'm in my goochie zone, zone
I ain't tripping, I'mma do my thing, yea
I'm in my goochie zone, zone
I'm turnt up about a hundred degrees
I'm good, I'm goochie
I'm good, I'm goochie
I'm good, I'm goochie
I'm good, I'm goochie
I'm in my goochie zone, zone
Hands up if you rolling with me

I'm in my goochie zone, zone
I'm good, I'm goochie
I'm good, I'm goochie
I'm good, I'm goochie
I'm good, I'm goochie
I'm good, I'm goochie
I'm good, I'm goochie
