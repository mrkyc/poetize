You tug first
And I pulled back
Conversation dead end we can do that
Who that?
Tell me why you always got to lie to a nigga?
All I wanted was your honesty
'stead you kept it real with everybody minus me
Trying me
Thinking that I didn't know 'bout you running round and fucking round with my niggas
'bout to make me go insane
Part of that made me distract the pain
But the rain ain't go
Watch it drown in a nigga
Became numb to the memory
All the misery was taking all my energy
Literally killin' me

Hook
You was an angel in disguise
Should of listened to Brandy
Now all young nigga do is get high
Find me in the club getting faded looking for a Nia Long
Trying to get her home
Get her in the end zone
Hoping that her feelings don't grow
But thanks to you I gotta let her know
You might also likeChorus
That baby I'm a love killa
Swear that I'm a love killa
I'm a love killa
Swear that I'm a love killa
And you da blame
You da blame
You da blame
Love killa
Baby I'm a love killa
I'm a love killa
Swear that I'm a love killa
And you da blame
You da blame
You da blame

Chorus 2
All alone, I was looking for love in the club
I shouldn't  have found you
When I found you
Shouldn't of tried to redefine you
Wasn't time too
I should of left you alone
Shouldn't play like that
Why I had to play like that?
Man the kush so strong
Man that ass so fat
Why you wear that dress like that?
Hook
You was an angel in disguise
Should of listened to Brandy
Now all young nigga do is get high
Find me in the club getting faded looking for a Nia Long
Trying to get her home
Get her in the end zone
Hoping that her feelings don't grow
But thanks to you I gotta let her know
Chorus
That baby I'm a love killa
Swear that I'm a love killa

Swear that I'm a love killa
And you da blame

Love killa
Baby I'm a love killa

Swear that I'm a love killa
And you da blame

Bridge
Tryna to slow down, I'm a killer now
To these girls I'm a rob em pussy in and out
They don't know its because of my past
I was tryna love too fast
You could blame my ex
I'm always on to the next
My heartbeat set on  a check
