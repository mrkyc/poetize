Ain't heard from you in weeks
That shits foreign to me
Oh baby no no no
(I know you saw me call oh)
My baby got me missing her
Make it bounce for a thug
You know I need love
Oh yeah
Yeah yeah
Cornbread pork rinds
You know I'm looking at you like it's mealtime
You know I never ran from a good time
She said
Every man tell lies
Baby them not I
No more online
I need to see that ass shake in real-time
You know I never ran from a good wine
Me seh
Baby slow grind
Let me take my time
God damn
I need some more
I miss that motion
This ain't for show
That body rolling
Give her that potion
She make it go
Back and forth
She leading me on
Out on the floor
Yeah she keep it going back and forth
I'm begging for more
That booty bounce
Back and forth

Right cheek left cheek
Put it on me
Test me test me
Cornbread pork rinds
You know I'm looking at you like it's mealtime
You know I never run from a good time
She said
Every man tell lies
Baby them not I
No more online
I need to see that ass shake in real-time
You know I never ran from a good wine
Me seh
Baby slow grind
Let me take my time
God damn

Give her that potion
She make it go
Back and forth
She leading me on
Out on the floor

Hope it's in store
That booty bouncing back and forth
