Hold up girl, just wind it slow (x3)
Hold up girl
(Pre-Chorus)
She's a twerkoholic, she's a twerkoholic
She's a twerkoholic, she needs me to get her started
My love is gonna get her faded
She said my love is so intoxicating
(Chorus)
Ride, ride, ride my lovin
Baby ride my love and don't stop
Baby ride, ride, ride my lovin
Baby ride my love and don't stop
(Baby!)
(Verse)
If you stay with me I'll do this verse
I'll be your designated driver, girl
I wanna take you home
Straight to the bed, let's skip the pillow talk
(Verse)
I know that I deserve you
Baby show me what that twerk do
Baby show me what that twerk do
Show me how you work you too
You might also like(Pre-Chorus)
Hold up girl, just wind it slow

She gon need rehab fo sure
Cus everywhere that she go
Hold up, let me clear my throat (uhhhm)
(Pre-Chorus)
She's a twerkoholic, she's a twerkoholic
She's a twerkoholic, she needs me to get her started
My love is gonna get her faded
She said my love is so intoxicating
(Chorus)
Ride, ride, ride my lovin
Baby ride my love and don't stop
Baby ride, ride, ride my lovin
Baby ride my love and don't stop

Shawty turned up to the max
All I wanna do is throw stacks
Baby go ahead and look back, go on and look back at it
Girl you got, you got it
Show them other girls that you know just what you are
(Pre-Chorus)
Hold up girl, just wind it slow

When I come around you lose control

She gon need rehab fo sure
Cus everywhere that she go
Hold up, let me clear my throat (uhhhm)
