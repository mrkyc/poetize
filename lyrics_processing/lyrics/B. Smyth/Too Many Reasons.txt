Tell your mama I ain't coming Christmas or holidays
Even she mad at ya cause you fucked up the place
Yeah you stacked ass fat but you know that don't change
Something on something wrong swear to god that bitch crazy
The shit I done witnessed, fucking these bitches
Swear yall don't know
And you ain't no different if you gone play victim

Fuck it I hate you, this time I mean it
And last time you hit me, that text got deleted
I say fuck it I hate you but you don't believe me
Why don't I hate you damn its just too many reasons
If I knew everything you did wrong (Its too many reasons)
This shit would take way too long (Its too many reasons)
If I said everything you did wrong
This shit would play all night long (its too many reasons)

Why you can't just  be happy all you had to do was chill
Look at you I made you famous, you done came up for real
Heard what you saying like I don't know your business
Your friend tried to fuck me and she told me you creeping
The shit I done witnessed, fucking these bitches
Swear yall don't know
And you ain't no different if you gone play victim
