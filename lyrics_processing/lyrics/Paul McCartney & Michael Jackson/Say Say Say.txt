Say, say, say what you want
But don't play games with my affection
Take, take, take what you need
But don't leave me with no direction

All alone, I sit home by the phone
Waiting for you, baby (Baby)
Through the years, how can you stand to hear
My pleading for you, dear?
You know I'm crying, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah

Now, go, go, go where you want
But don't leave me here forever
You, you, you, stay away
So long, girl, I see you never

What can I do, girl, to get through to you?
'Cause I love you, baby (Baby)
Standing here, baptized in all my tears
Baby, through the years, you know I'm crying
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You might also like
(You've got to say, say, say
You've got to say, say, say...)

You never, ever worry
And you never shed a tear
You're saying that my love ain't real
Just look at my face, these tears ain't drying

You, you, you can never say
That I'm not the one who really loves you
(I pray) Pray, pray everyday
That you'll see things, girl, like I do

What can I do, girl, to get through to you?
'Cause I love you (Love you), baby (Baby)
Standing here, baptized in all my tears
Baby, through the years, you know I'm crying
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Say, say, say)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...)
Oh, baby
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...)
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Say, say, say (Say, say, say)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, say, say, say, ooh, ooh, ooh, say, say, say...
Come on
(Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say...)
Come on
Ooh, ooh, ooh, say, say, say, ooh, ooh, ooh, say, say, say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, say, say, say, ooh, ooh, ooh, say, say, say...
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Say, say, say
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Come on)
