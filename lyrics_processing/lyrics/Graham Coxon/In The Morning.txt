Are you really there? Are you even real?
I don't know which way to go when I hear you everywhere
There's a melody in every line and a sorrow in these eyes of mine
If a diamond hangs in every tree
And a life is lost for every leaf, can a bird still sing?
I listened just this morning, this is what I heard
An angel's wings in cool night air like a blackbird in the chapel
A starling in the moonlight fair wings beating up a gale
In the morning, in the morning, in the morning, ooh, in the morning
You're a part of the air and you shake a whole field
With your golden hair and your golden shield
I don't know which way to go when I hear you everywhere
There's a melody in every line and a sorrow in these eyes of mine
If a diamond hangs in every tree
And a life is lost for every leaf, can a bird still sing?
I listened just this morning, this is what I heard
An angel's wings in cool night air like a blackbird in the chapel
A starling in the moonlight fair wings beating up a gale
In the morning, in the morning, in the morning, ooh, in the morning
Like a piece of the air, it's just how you feel
Just hovering there, are you even real?
I don't know which way to go when I hear you everywhere

I listened just this morning, this is what I heard
An angel's wings in cool night air like a blackbird in the hail
Starlings in the moonlight fair wings beating up a gale
Legless owl in endless flight, unable for to settle
In oceans like a giant's mind harbouring its mettle
