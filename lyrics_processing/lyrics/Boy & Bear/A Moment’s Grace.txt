I wasn't born this way
I've been living a lie, they say
So when it brought me to my knees
Well, I had everything
So tell me, would you, please
How could I possibly have needed so much more?

The thing I was craving then
Was some kind of laboring
So I might find a friend
In all the aching
In my muscles as they hurt
Oh, won't you put my hands to work to ease my mind?

And you realize in a moment's grace
You've been unraveling the fabric of your coat
And you pick a line down the wall and trace
Until the end

And when you walk back sorry
With a folding body
Like you should
No, I am not gonna die this way

Maybe it was the mold, you see
That was knocking the wall in me
And I forgot just what it was that
I had needed to be
For all the time I'd been given
Maybe I'd forgot what living was now for

And, you realize in a moment's grace
You might just already be on to something good
And you pick a line down a cord and trace
Because you can

And when it comes back heavy
You'll be more than ready
Like you should
'Cause I am not gonna die this way

Through a crack in the road, it sprung
The seedling, warm and young
Stretching out for the sun
It's August and I'm grinnin'
For this time I might be winnin'
As the moving lights that time of year lay still
And as my body changes a pace, I seem to know again
That I am not gonna die this way

Oh, I'll hold my missus
In a bed of kisses
Like I should
