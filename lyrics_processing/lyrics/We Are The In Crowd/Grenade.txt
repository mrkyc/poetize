That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all
But you never give
Should of known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open?
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked, 'cause
What you don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah , yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah) oooh, oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya baby
But you won't do the same...
No, no, no, no
Black, black, black and blue beat me till I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "hey" when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the breaks out my car
You might also likeGave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked, cause
What you don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah , yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah) oooh, oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain!
Yes, I would die for ya baby
But you won't do the same...
If my body was on fire
Ooh you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did baby!
...But darling
I'll still catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah , yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah) oooh, oh
I would go through all this pain...
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya baby
But you won't do the same
No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Ooh, you'll never do the same
