She's like a rock and I keep chipping off a piece to hold on to
And she's got a lot of nerve not seeing you the way that I do

We are, oh, we're about to be
So much closer than you thought that we could ever be
Well, I'm sorry to say that I gave it away
We'll I'm empty and you're empty

It's none of my business, but I won't be a witness
If I hang on for the ride I promise I will crash without her there

She's like a rock and you keep chipping off a piece to hold on to
And there's gotta be, gotta be something more than this
In a life full of exits and entrances

I know the way this plays out
But, I couldn't find the words to tell you
And you thought that every time she would never tell a lie
But, believing a liar is feeding the fire

It's none of your business, but I won't be a witness
(Hang on for the ride)
No, it's none of your business, but I won't be a witness
(Hang on for the ride)

Something more than this
She's like a rock and you keep chipping off a piece to hold on to

Did you get what you wanted?
Cause I couldn't get enough
Now I'm back where I started again
She's like a rock and you keep chipping off a piece, chipping off a piece
She's like a rock and you keep chipping off a piece, chipping off a piece
(Yeah, she's like a rock)
She's like a rock and you keep chipping off a piece to hold on to
