We're all just weird kids in the end

Attention (Attention)
I'll walk you through this slowly if you're still listening
Here's your penny back for stealing our thoughts
All for the sake of wanting more
(Play it safe while you keep score)
And one day
We might find that peace of mind that we lost in the first place

I know the way I wanna be
But I'm trapped in who I am
The only thing that holds me back is
Believing that I needed change
We are (we are)
The only friends we have
And if there's nothing left
And I fall
We don't fall apart
We're all just weird kids in the end

I tied up my laces, left my loose ends hanging
On the words that I had wished that I said
Memories that keep me up in bed
Shoulda coulda would've stayed the way I've been
If it wasn't for the means, there'd be no end
To sleepless nights in parking lots that light the way
To make the better me
If I could write these feelings into a greater meaning
They'd fall on deaf ears (Fall on deaf ears)

I know the way I wanna be
But I'm trapped in who I am
The only thing that holds me back is
Believing that I needed change
We are (we are)
The only friends we have
And if there's nothing left
And I fall
We don't fall apart

We don't fall apart
We don't fall apart (We don't fall, we don't fall, we don't fall)
We don't fall apart

I know the way I wanna be
But I'm trapped in who I am
The only thing that holds me back is not
Believing

We are (we are)
The only friends we have
And if there's nothing left
And I fall
We don't fall apart
I know the way I wanna be
But I'm trapped in who I am
The only thing that holds me back is
Believing that I needed change
We are (we are)
The only friends we have
And if there's nothing left
And I fall
We don't fall apart
