I got with a girl and started a war
How could I know she was trouble?
Oh, I thought that I could ignore her
Now I'm closer, but at least I'm not sleeping alone
I gave him the world
Showed him the door
Now he should know how it feels to go
I'm broken down on the surface
I don't deserve this
It's the last straw now

Say goodbye to the night
Of getting into trouble and dancing with the devil
If you wanna fight
Well, girl, you must be dreaming
I love to hear you screaming
Well, then, I give up if you just stop this whole thing all together
You used to be my treasure
But if I say goodbye
For the last time
I'm closer than you realize

I traveled the world
To forget about the girl
How could I know she would follow me?
Wherever I go now
I don't know how
But he's always there
You might also like
Say goodbye to the night
Of getting into trouble and dancing with the devil
If you wanna fight
Well, girl, you must be dreaming
I love to hear you screaming
Well, then, I give up if you just stop this whole thing all together
You used to be my treasure
But if I say goodbye
For the last time
I'm closer than you realize

Tell me how you feel about moving on without me now
Go on, go on
Shake it off and hold me down
I don't wanna see you around
Well then
I give up if you just stop this whole thing all together
You used to be my treasure

Say goodbye to the night
Of getting into trouble and dancing with the devil
If you wanna fight
Well, girl, you must be dreaming, I love to hear you screaming
Well, then, I give up if you just stop this whole thing all together
You used to be my treasure
But if I say goodbye
For the last time
