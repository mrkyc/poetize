This is verbal assassination, emancipation of word
The smart motherfuckers never follow the herd
Dumb voices was all that you heard before me
Let me refine and redesign the CV of an MC
Verbally attacking these cats with no backbone
Holding the world on my shoulders till my backbone broke
This tsunami flow rapping, will you float or choke?
Will you swim or dip, there's no motherfucking boat
I never capsize but i got the cap's eyes
And i see the debris of MC's in my mind
Killing these fucking beats till they bleed my enzymes
You admirers, prior to Myers i put the mic
What i look like, is what you get
That motherfucking ugly cover is actually accurate
This is me on my randy savage shit
Attacking these rappers bad as a radically disastrous acid trip
Ill, quick witted, sinister spitting cannibal
Cause i eat more MC's, than Texans are dropping n-bombs
I'm atomic, and ready to go off, tick-tock
I'm like a gun half-cocked, unexpected (blaugh)
Rated r, for radical tactical mad flows
Pack a punch, heater, Henney, ready for any asshole
And a bag of weed to feed l's like Castro
Who says you need a cash flow to make a cash flow?
I got motherfucking ill intent but i mean well
I'll leave a dent like three males in a female
I'm real intense like hell in a heat spell
In fact, if you fuck with me i guarantee you'll see hell
Disrespect my flow and you'll see shells
I'm like what you see on 3 e's, i'm too real
I'm 3D to your 2D, high detail
I'm a vinyl to your CD, on retail
He sells weed bales on the sea shore
Hit a bitch like 3 l's, she begging for more
This some shit you'll retell for sure
Not Horrorcore but i got a horrible core
Autobot with a Decepticon artist flow
My lyrics cleansing the game, just like a bar of soap
Any opponents probably tripping of a bar of dope
