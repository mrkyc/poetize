Turn off your lights
Turn off your phone
Turn off your whole work week
Tune out the fast, tune in the slow
Get ready to roll with me
Let's do a little somethin' 'bout this fire we been dancin' around
I bet this high will get a little higher when the sun goes down

Let's turn up that riverbank dirt road
I'll turn up the country boy charm
Turn up that Lynchburg let go
Maybe you'll turn up in my arms
Maybe turn up a little Conway Twitty
We might just turn up in love
Let's point this Chevy out of this city and when we get far enough
Girl we gonna turn up

Gimme that smile
Gimme that vibe
Gimme that green light look
When it's alright to let this night
Get a little off the hook
Talkin' laid back in the way back
Where the moon's the only light there is
It's a perfect time and baby I've been waiting on a night like this
