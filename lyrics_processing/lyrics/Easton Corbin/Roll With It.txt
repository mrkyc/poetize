I got my old guitar and some fishing poles
So baby, fill that cooler full of something cold
Don't ask, just pack and we'll hit the road runnin'
Honey, what do you say?
I got just enough money and just enough gas
So pick a place on the map we can get to fast
Where the white sandy beach meets water like glass
And if the tide carries us away

Baby, we'll roll with it
Won't think about it too much
Baby, let's just go with it
And get out of this ordinary everyday rut
If we get swept away by one of those perfect days
When the sun is sinkin' low at dusk
And wind up a little deeper in love
Baby, let's roll with it

We get so caught up in catchin' up
Trying to pay the rent, tryna to make a buck
That don't leave much time for time for us
And ain't life too short for that?
So open up that bag of pig skins you bought
At the Exxon station the last time we stopped
And you can kick back, baby, and dance in your socks
On the windshield to some radio rock

And we'll roll with it
Won't think about it too much
Baby, let's just go with it
And get out of this ordinary everyday rut
If we get swept away by one of those perfect days
When the sun is sinkin' low at dusk
And wind up a little deeper in love
Baby, we'll roll with it

Won't think about it too much
Sometimes you gotta go with it
And get out of this ordinary everyday rut
And it won't be no thing if it starts to rain
And we have to wait it out in the truck
We might wind up a little deeper in love
So baby, let's roll with it
Baby, let's roll with it
Baby, we'll roll with it
