I know we said that it was over
We made a promise we'd still be friends
I know you wanted us to call each other
And check in every now and then
But you keep callin' 'bout your mama
And every time you've had a bad day
I know I made a promise, but I gotta be honest
It don't work that way

'Cause I can't look at you, baby, and not see your pretty
Dirt road, my Chevy, and not want you with me
Girl, we can both pretend
But you know I'm gonna want you again
Old lovers don't make good friends

Already know what's gonna happen
If I happen to see you out
We'll both fake it and just try to make it
Look like we're nothin' now
But, girl, who are we kidding?
There ain't no way on Earth
To be in the same room and not wanna hold you
That ain't how it works

'Cause I can't look at you, baby, and not see your pretty
Dirt road, my Chevy, and not want you with me
Girl, we can both pretend
But you know I'm gonna want you again
I can't pour up a drink and not start to think
About where you are, want you back in my arms
Yeah, you and I know that road leads to a dead end
Old lovers don't make good friends

I can't look at you, baby, and not see your pretty
Dirt road, my Chevy, and not want you with me
Girl, we can both pretend
But you know I'm gonna want you again
I can't hear your voice, I can't hear your name
I wish that I could, but girl, I just can't
You and I know that road leads to a dead end
Old lovers don't make good friends
