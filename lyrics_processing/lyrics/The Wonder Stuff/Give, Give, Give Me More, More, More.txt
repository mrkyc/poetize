Well, I hope I make more money than this in the next world
I hope there's a lot more riches there for me
I'd like my trousers pressed and my shoes shined up by a rich girl
Whose only care in the world is me

But are these all the brains I'm entitled to have?
Don't try to make me happy, when I'm happy feeling bad
I've got no manners nor a hand to shake
Why should I tell the truth when it's easier to fake?

So give, give, give me more, more, more
I'd like it all
Give, give, give me more, more, more
I'd like it all

Is the bank big enough?
Coming ready or not to the next world
I hope there's a whole lot more in it there for me
I'd like my friends to be rich and I'll never do a stitch in the next world
And my only care in the world is me

But are these all the brains I'm entitled to have?
Don't try to make me happy, when I'm happy feeling bad
I've got no manners nor a hand to shake
Why should I tell the truth when it's easier to fake?

Just give, give, give me more, more, more
I'd like it all
Give, give, give me more, more, more
I'd like it all

Is the bank big enough?
Coming ready or not to the next world
Is the bank big enough?
Coming ready or not to the next world
Oh, is your bank big enough?
Coming ready or not to the next world
Is the bank big enough?
Coming ready or not to the next world

Just give, give, give me more, more, more
I'd like it all
Give, give, give me more, more, more
I'd like it all
Give, give, give me more, more, more
I'd like it all
Give, give, give me more, more, more
