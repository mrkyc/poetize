Resolute, a stance of defiance
Always teetering on the brink
Nothing can hold you back when
When you're not holding back a thing
Open arms, we embrace tomorrow
Closed fists, tarnishing today
We're not afraid to open our mouths and scream
We believe in what we say

Like a whisper to the dusk
An oath against the shadows
Denying the dark
Fight, fight, fight 'til the break of dawn
Like a prayer unto the dawn
In arms against the shadows
Destroying the dark
Fight, fight, fight 'til the break of dawn

Covered in sweat and blood
Yet still our heads held high
Actions have consequences
When you live for foolish pride
Been careful not to lose ourselves
Stand together: one passion, one hate
We believe in a better tomorrow
We believe in what we say
You might also like
Like a whisper to the dusk
An oath against the shadows
Denying the dark
Fight, fight, fight 'til the break of dawn
Like a prayer unto the dawn
In arms against the shadows
Destroying the dark
Fight, fight, fight 'til the break of dawn
Fight, fight, fight 'til the break of dawn

We'll fight our battles, we'll wage our wars
Settle the scores with honor and blood
We'll wear our scars like medals of hope
Like medals of hope, like medals of hope
We'll fight our battles, we'll wage our wars
Settle the scores with honor and blood
We'll wear our scars like medals of hope
Like medals of hope, like medals of hope

Like a whisper to the dusk
An oath against the shadows
Denying the dark
Fight, fight, fight 'til the break of dawn
Like a prayer unto the dawn
In arms against the shadows
Destroying the dark (Whisper to the dusk)
In arms against the shadows
Destroying the dark (Whisper to the dusk)
In arms against the shadows
Destroying the dark
Fight, fight, fight 'til the break of dawn
Fight, fight, fight 'til the break of dawn
Fight, fight, fight 'til the break of dawn
