I began my ascent at minus zero
You made so sure of that
You tried to keep me down here
Your complacency has been your downfall
Nobody made you king of the world
And now I'm here to dethrone
So, kiss the ring, motherfucker
It's my time, my time to shine
Grasping for the straws as they fall
Maybe you make a splint
For your broken ego
For your broken ego

And I say thank you for the scars
And the guilt and the pain
Every tear I've never cried
Has sealed your fucking fate
Did you take me for a fool
Or were you just too blind to see
That every effort made has failed
And there is no destroying me?

Hate can be a positive emotion
When it forces you to better yourself
You built me, constructed my desire
Perfected my hatred
Now I'm driven to be
Ten times better than you think you are
Ten times better
Than you think you are
You might also like
Piece by piece, I've built my walls
And burned the bridges down (Ooh)
That lead back to people like you
So full of malice, so full of scorn (Ooh)
You tried your best to crush my spirit
You tried to steal my soul (Ooh)
You pushed my back against the wall
And I broke it down

I will not be broken
Though I am the one that bleeds
I will not be broken
I am the one
I will not be broken
Though I am the one that bleeds
I will not be broken
I am the one
I will not be broken
Though I am the one that bleeds
I will not be broken
I am the one

And I say thank you for the scars
And the guilt and the pain
Every tear I've never cried
Has sealed your fucking fate
Did you take me for a fool
Or were you just too blind to see
That every effort made has failed
And there is no destroying me?
There is no destroying me
