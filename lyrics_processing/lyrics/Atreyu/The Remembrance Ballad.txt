These days are closing in
The end has become apparent
We're only here for so long
Will anyone remember my name
When time has washed away
The dust of my ashes?
When my head rests
In a velvet-lined casket?

What's out there?
What is my eternal fate?
And it only just recently hit me
That this life is just a state
Mortality fading
Like the innocence of love
I'm scared to death
Of what's to become

Of my immortal soul
Of this eternal flame
Will you remember?
Will your heart sing with pain?
You might also like
Who calls out my name? (My name)
Who can tell me what happens
When my eyes close
For the last time? (My eyes close)
Does it all simply end
In a blanket of darkness? (Does it end?)
And what of my soul?
What of my soul?

All those things that you couldn't say
You should've said (You should've said)
All those "I love you's" lost
Weighed more like lead on your chest (Lead on your chest)
All those things that you couldn't say
You should've said (You should've said)
All those "I love you's" lost
Weighed more like lead on your chest
What of!

Of my immortal soul
Of this eternal flame
Will you remember?
Will your heart sing with pain?
Who calls out my name? (My name)
Who can tell me what happens
When my eyes close
For the last time? (My eyes close)
Does it all simply end
In a blanket of darkness? (Does it end?)
And what of my soul?
What of my soul?


If I could take back
All those misspent days
Every second of anger
I would wash my sins away!

Who calls out my name? (My name)
Who can tell me what happens
When my eyes close
For the last time? (My eyes close)
Does it all simply end
In a blanket of darkness? (Does it end?)
And what of my soul?
What of my soul?
Who calls out my name? (My name)
Who can tell me what happens
When my eyes close
For the last time? (My eyes close)
Does it all simply end
In a blanket of darkness? (Does it end?)
And what of my soul?
