I'll start right here and say these words
I was scared and looking for a home
Nowhere to roam
You came here, filled up my soul
A blinding love that won't let go
A surprise, are you really mine?
I'm complete and can't believe
I'm holding you and you're holding me

Sure as the bird will fly
I'll be standing by your side
(On and on and on and on)
I will be your superhero
And if you're lost in the cold, dark night
I will be your guiding light
(On and on and on and on)
I will be your superhero

Years of searching for the light
It's funny how the cracks begin to show
Drift among the sea at night
But sometimes, it's the smaller hands that row
Take me home
So hang your head upon me now
And know that I will never let you go
You might also like
Sure as the bird will fly
I'll be standing by your side
(On and on and on and on)
I will be your superhero
And if you're lost in the cold, dark night
I will be your guiding light
(On and on and on and on)
I will be your superhero

I will never lay down
Until I see this through
I will fight, I will battle
Decimating all at will
Those who stand to oppose
The love I feel for you
I will fight, I will battle
For a better life for you

Sure as the bird will fly
I'll be standing by your side
(On and on and on and on)
I will be your superhero
And if you're lost in the cold, dark night
I will be your guiding light
(On and on and on and on)
I will be your superhero
(On and on and on and on)
I will be your superhero
(On and on and on and on)
I will be your superhero
And if you're lost in the cold, dark night
I will be your guiding light
(On and on and on and on)
