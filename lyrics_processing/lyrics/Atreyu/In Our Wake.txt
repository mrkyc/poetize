Who will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?
Who will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?
(One, two, one, two, three, go)

Will I be more than flesh?
Can I leave more than bones?
Will these words have an impact?
Can they be carved into stone?
Force yourself to remember
Or choose to forget
You can leave this world as a lion
Or just fall asleep in it

We break like the ocean, we rise like the tide
We drown in emotion but reach for the sky
We're moving up mountains, we're making a change
Drink youth from the fountain before it's too late
Who will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?
Who will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?

Will I leave you better off than I found you?
Shining and pristine?
Or will I deceive you, mislead, and destroy you?
The choice is up to me
You might also like
We break like the ocean, we rise like the tide
We drown in emotion but reach for the sky
We're moving up mountains, we're making a change
Drink youth from the fountain before it's too late
Who will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?
Who will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?

Who will we leave in our wake?
Yeah


We break like the ocean, we rise like the tide
We drown in emotion but reach for the sky
We're moving up mountains, we're making a change
Drink youth from the fountain before it's too late
Who will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?
Who will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?
