There you go, you dumb kid
Running your mouth again and again
Talking all that shit with a big grin
Tripping on words again and again
Oh how exceptional the sound
Of your word vomit coming out
You're getting caught up saying foolish things
I don't believe you believe half the shit you say

Say what you want, I don't give a fuck
I learn things the hard way

Lay yourself down on the tracks (lay down)
Be crucified by your own words
You're no cross bearer
You're not a fucking martyr
(Just a kid, only a fool)
Barely man enough to stand
You're no cross bearer
You're not a fucking martyr

You're no cross bearer
You're no martyr
You might also like
The world doesn't need more mindless shit
Labeled as unique, there's no heart to it
You may never feel it like I feel it
You'll never learn, there's no heart to it
But you've got the biggest fucking balls
Brass ones that drag as you crawl
And for some reason, I think you stole them
You may be faking after all

Say what you want, I don't give a fuck
I learn things the hard way

Lay yourself down on the tracks (lay down)
Be crucified by your own words
You're no cross bearer
You're not a fucking martyr
(Just a kid, only a fool)
Barely man enough to stand
You're no cross bearer
You're not a fucking martyr

Say what you want, I don't give a fuck
I learn things the hard way
Say what you want, we don't give a fuck
We learn things the hard way
Say what you want, we don't give a fuck
We learn things the hard way
Lay yourself down on the tracks (lay down)
Be crucified by your own words
You're no cross bearer
You're not a fucking martyr
(Just a kid, only a fool)
Barely man enough to stand
You're no cross bearer
