Hold your breath, enable the sinner
When good people go silent, there's no winners
Only accomplices and deceivers
When good people go silent, there's no winners

To me, you're all the same
You should be bound and draped in chains
A bully, a rapist, it's all the same
Overload the boat, don't drag the lake

The only thing you're taking from me
Is a burning ax to the carotid artery
The only thing you're taking from me
Is a burning ax to the carotid artery
Some heads have gotta roll

Cut off the head and burn the body down
Burn it down
There is a demon living inside of you
A demon inside of you

Destroy you, I can justify the violence
Break through the shame and the silence
After so much has been taken away
The evil in you should be fully repaid
Some heads have gotta roll
You might also like
Cut off the head and burn the body down
Burn it down
There is a demon living inside of you
A demon inside of you
And when the pushed push back, we'll see who's who
We'll see who's who
You will be damned, wasted in solitude
Wasted in solitude

And in the end
In the fires of hell
May be your torment
Redefine and amplify your constant suffering

Jet black your heart
Cut out your heart
Jet black your heart
Cut out your heart
There is no justice
There is no justice
Jet black your heart
Cut out your heart
Some heads have gotta roll
Cut off the head and burn the body down
Burn it down
There is a demon living inside of you
A demon inside of you
And when the pushed push back, we'll see who's who
We'll see who's fucking who
You will be damned, wasted in solitude
