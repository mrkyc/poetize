Yeah

I've got a fucking curse (Curse)
Wrapped in a problem
Hidden inside of my brain
And everywhere I look (Look)
Hidden in every song
The ending is the same
I don't know if I can see the blue skies
When all I see is shrouded in gray
And I don't care if I make you happy
'Cause every day, I'm living in pain
I am living in pain

I am thunder, I am rain
Just a human hurricane
Smashing everything that stands in front of me (In front of me)
I'm the blood that's pouring out
I'm the kingdom burning down
And I am so afraid that nothing will ever change
(Nothing will ever change)

It's automatic, negative, sarcastic
It's got a hold of me, destroying everything
It doesn't care as it shades the greatest days
Warping reality
It's rotting inside me
I can't see any more
It's like the devil's pissed off, burning inside me
I can't love anymore
Used up, burned out, borderline psycho
(Fuck it)

I am thunder, I am rain
Just a human hurricane
Smashing everything that stands in front of me (In front of me)
I'm the blood that's pouring out
I'm the kingdom burning down
And I am so afraid that nothing will ever change
(Nothing will ever change)

I fan the flames inside of me
And I taste the blood between my teeth
Buried my demons ten feet deep
But they still creep back to choke me out

I am thunder, I am rain
Just a human hurricane
Smashing everything that stands in front of me (In front of me)
I'm the blood that's pouring out
I'm the kingdom burning down
And I am so afraid that nothing will ever change
(Nothing will ever change)

Nothing will ever change
Nothing will ever change
Nothing will ever change
(Nothing will ever change)
Nothing will ever change
Nothing will ever change
