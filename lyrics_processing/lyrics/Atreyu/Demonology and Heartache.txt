So unaffectionate, so insecure
You claim to know a thing or two about heartache
And what it's like to have your insides pulled out
And I believe you
I see it every time your pallbearer's pallor
Is obscured by the darkness (The darkness)
Dancing across your face (Across your face)
And when the blackness veils your eyes in pain

I know what it's like
When memories make you wince
And love letters read like obituaries
And photo albums are the books of the dead
I need no reminders (No more reminders)
I'll forget the past and lay it to rest

If I had my way, I'd cut
The calluses off your
Off your breaking heart
If I could get past the sternum
Cauterize those wounds
With every kiss I could give to you
I'm holding your heart in my hands
The reason it still beats
You might also like
Am I being too cryptic?
Am I being too obscure?
Am I being too cryptic?
Am I being too obscure?

Love kills, romance is dead
And I don't even trust myself, but I love you
And you can pull my wings apart
And pin me down under glass
Until the end of days
If it can help you discover
That we share the same pain
I just hope you write your thesis before
Your subject is dead
No life after death

If I had my way, I'd cut
The calluses off your
Off your breaking heart
If I could get past the sternum
Cauterize those wounds
With every kiss I could give to you
I'm holding your heart in my hands
The reason it still beats
If I had my way, I'd cut
The calluses off your
Off your breaking heart
If I could get past the sternum
Cauterize those wounds
With every kiss I could give to you
I'm holding your heart in my hands
