This shit's contagious like a fucking disease
Infecting every stupid person that's in front of me
Goddamn, how blind are we
To only see the differences in everything?
Hell on Earth is what we seek
An apocalyptic sci-fi reality
Blowing up (Blowing up) right in front of me
Dancing in the streets with the dead bodies, sing it
Dancing in the streets with the dead bodies

Blind, deaf, and dumb
Hopeless and happily numb
Wearing a smile as we create our own hell
We're at an all-time low
Can you get that through your skull?
How can you fix the world if you can't fix yourself?
Yeah, we're

Caustic, back once again
Has got me in a state of disbelief
Like, "Oh, shit, here we go again"
I think that we're all living in sin
Your ignorance, it isn't a gift
But you keep it, love it, nurture it
I gotta ask, where are we going with this?
It feels like the end, are you sick of it?

Blind, deaf, and dumb
Hopeless and happily numb
Wearing a smile as we create our own hell
We're at an all-time low
Can you get that through your skull?
How can you fix the world if you can't fix yourself?

One day, you'll wake up
And you'll see how bad you've fucked up
You've lived a life in fear and created hell
So, open your mind
And see the hate you've left behind
The only way to fix yourself
Is to find some love inside your empty heart
Blind, deaf, and dumb
Hopeless and happily numb
Wearing a smile as we create our own hell
We're at an all-time low
Can you get that through your skull?
How can you fix the world if you can't fix yourself?
Yeah, we're
