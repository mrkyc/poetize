Go

Picture yourself alone
And trapped in a dark flooding room
The water is rising up
And signaling the impeding doom
Kicking at the walls with bound legs
Screaming at the world with no voice
Breaking your hands against black walls

The journey is long
And wrought with peril
I will be strong
This is never-ending

Please know I'd fight for you
And listening after all this heartache
You are my everything
I'll simply die for you
You are the greatest gift of all, yeah
You are so heavenly
You might also like
And so I am tested
Punished, broken, dejected
Trying to buy you myself
Vowing to find a way out
Fake positivity
All that's left fueling me
The pain did not cause any doubt

The journey is long
And wrought with peril
I will be strong
This is never-ending

Please know I'd fight for you
And listening after all this heartache
You are my everything
I'll simply die for you
You are the greatest gift of all, yeah
You are so heavenly

This I swear, by the blood of my own
I will protect you, I could weather any storm
This I swear, my heart on my home
To love and protect you, to fight each and every war
This I swear, it's all that I know
To be your example, to stand up when others fall
Down

Please know I'd fight for you
The clouds part
And listening after all this heartache
The angels sing
I'll simply die for you
And there you were sitting next to me
You are the greatest gift of all, yeah
The greatest smile, I will ever see
You're everything
You're heavenly

Please know I'd fight for you
The clouds part
And listening after all this heartache
The angels sing
I'll simply die for you
And there you were sitting next to me
You are the greatest gift of all, yeah
The greatest smile, I will ever see
You're everything
