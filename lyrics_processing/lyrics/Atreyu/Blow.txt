So, fucking blow those words out the back of your head
I've heard it all and I'm done with that shit
You tell me lies and you give what you get
So, blow those fucking words out the back of your head

Oh, my God, did you just hear
Lies are coming back in style?
Oh, my God, they seem so real
That they bind you and confine you
So shut your mouth, we've heard it all (What?)
Hypocrites and critics all
Can fuck off, we do this for our souls
For our souls

What they say won't make us go away

So, fucking blow those words out the back of your head
I've heard it all and I'm done with that shit
You tell me lies and you give what you get
So, blow those fucking words out the back of your head
(Back of your head)

We're not sorry and we won't conform
It's not a choice but something inborn
If we fail following our hearts
Can you blame us? No, no, no
A square peg in a black hole
We don't fit in, that's the way it goes (Way it goes)
You shouldn't act like you're better than us
'Cause you're not, no, no, no

What they say won't make us go away

So, fucking blow those words out the back of your head
I've heard it all and I'm done with that shit
You tell me lies and you give what you get
So, blow those fucking words out the back of your head
So, fucking blow those words out the back of your head
(Back of your head)
I've heard it all and I'm done with that shit
You tell me lies and you give what you get
So, blow those fucking words out the back of your head
B-B-Blow those fucking words out the back of your head
(Back of your head, back of your head)
(Back of your head, back of your head)
(Back of your head, back of your head, back of your head)

Tell yourself you're not alone at all
Looking out your window (At all)
I know you're all alone (Not alone at all)
Tell yourself you're not alone at all
Looking out your window
At all!
You're not alone (No, no, no!)


What they say won't make us go away
(Go away, go away, go away)

So, fucking blow those words out the back of your head
I've heard it all and I'm done with that shit
You tell me lies and you give what you get

Of your head, of your head, of your head
Yeah! Oh!
