I feel it welling up inside
And Robert Smith lied
Boys do cry
And with blood tears in my eyes
I'm an Anne Rice novel come to life
I can't hide the monster anymore
One can only feel desolate for so long

Until one starts to change
Into something the mirror doesn't recognize
I metamorphosize
The darkness has been biding its time
To claim its latest victim
Fresh meat for carnal desires
To become what I became
I viewed the sun for the last time

Will you still hold me
When you see what I have done?
Will you still kiss me the same
When you taste my victim's blood?
So crimson and red
I feel it flowing from your lips
Crimson and red
My heart is dead and so are you
You might also like
And it pulses through, the desire to change
To deconstruct all of my
All of my past failings
But where to begin?
Because when you live in sin
It's hard to look at saints
Without them reflecting
Your jet-black auras back on you

And all I have is hope
My inner burn's not fading
I'll wipe the blood from my cheek
And get on with my day

Will you still hold me
When you see what I have done?
Will you still kiss me the same
When you taste my victim's blood?
So crimson and red
I feel it flowing from your lips
Crimson and red
My heart is dead and so are you
And all I have is hope, and all I need is time
To bury in pine under six feet of time
The lies I told me about myself
Claw my way out
Pick the splinters from under my fingernails
I won't lose hope, I won't give in

Just live and breathe and try not to die again
Just live and breathe and try not to die again
Just live and breathe and try not to die again
I try not to die again

Will you still hold me
When you see what I have done?
Will you still kiss me the same
When you taste my victim's blood?
So crimson and red
I feel it flowing from your lips
Crimson and red
My heart is dead and so are you
Will you still hold me
When you see what I have done?
Will you still kiss me the same
When you taste my victim's blood?
So crimson and red
I feel it flowing from your lips
Crimson and red
