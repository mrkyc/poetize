Dig a shallow grave and I'll lay me down
Over the moor, take me to the moor
Dig a shallow grave and I'll lay me down
Lesley Anne and your pretty white beads
Oh, John, you'll never be a man
And you'll never see your home again
Oh, Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
Tonight will be your very last night
A woman said, "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his sacred head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes
Hindley wakes and says
"Oh, wherever he has gone, I have gone"
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death
Fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death
Hindley wakes and says
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes
Hindley wakes and says
"Oh, whatever he has done, I have done"
You might also likeBut this is no easy ride, for a child cries
"Oh, find me, find me, nothing more
We are on a sullen misty moor
We may be dead and we may be gone
But we will be, we will be
We will be right by your side
Until the day you die, this is no easy ride
We will haunt you when you laugh
Yes, you could say we're a team
You might sleep, you might sleep
You might sleep, but
You will never dream
Oh, you might sleep, but you will never dream
You might sleep, but you will never dream"
Oh, Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh, Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh, find me, find me
Find me
I'll haunt you when you laugh
Oh, I'll haunt you when you laugh
You might sleep, but you, oh
You will never dream, oh
Oh, over the moors, I'm on the moor
Oh, over the moor
