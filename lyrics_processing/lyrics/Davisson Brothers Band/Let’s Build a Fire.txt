22 headlights, drop it in low
Get a little sideways down a backroad
Park 'em where you want to, ain't nobody cares
Leave the keys in 'em, we ain't goin' nowhere
The sun goin' down, there's a chill in the air

Let's build a fire, make it burn all damn night
Keep it rollin' hot and high
Listen to the rhythm of the whistlin' and the hissin' and the flames
Dancin' 'round, callin' our names
Man in the moon, we'll be walkin' on coals
While we're buzzin' on a breeze in the midnight glow
I get the guitar, you get the shine
The smoke'll have us higher than a Georgia pine
Let's build a fire

15 down on a 24 special
Pass it all around, got us laughin' like the devil
The only that we could get higher

Let's build a fire, make it burn all damn night
Keep it rollin' hot and high
Listen to the rhythm of the whistlin' and the hissin' and the flames
Dancin' 'round, callin' our names
Man in the moon, we'll be walkin' on coals
While we're buzzin' on a breeze in the midnight glow
I get the guitar, you get the shine
The smoke'll have us higher than a Georgia pine
Let's build a fire
You might also like
When the shine runs low and the still gets cold
Us backwoods boys know where to go
Let's build a fire, make it burn all damn night
Keep it rollin' hot and high

Let's build a fire, make it burn all damn night
Keep it rollin' hot and high
Listen to the rhythm of the whistlin' and the hissin' and the flames
Dancin' 'round, callin' our names
Man in the moon, we'll be walkin' on coals
While we're buzzing' on a breeze in the midnight glow
I get the guitar, you get the shine
The smoke'll have us higher than a Georgia pine
The smoke'll have us higher than a Georgia pine
