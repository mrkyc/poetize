You only get one go around, you only get one life
No raincheck second chance, line in a pine box, damn sure better get it right
It's gonna be what you make it
So keep it real, don't fake it
You better stand up for what you stand for
Know who you right down to the core

If you're a cowboy, get your hat on
If you're a steel horse Harley man, get your ride on
If you should've been born way back in the 60's
Peace out and love on, long haired hippies
If you're a big rig man, roll on mother trucker
Walk your own line, fly your own color
When you're born red, white, and blue, you're free to choose
Green as Willie's grass or black like Cash

I said a wine lover down like whiskey, and a whiskey lover don't like beer
Left or right, pick a side, go ahead draw a line, don't lie to the man in the mirror
Ain't no use in tryin' to fight it
Ain't no way you're gonna hide it
You better do what you do, be who you are
Don't be afraid to put some bite in you bark

If you're hip-hop, get your rhyme on
If you're a party all nighter, man rock on
If you're an air guitar superstar, proud pre-Madonna
Go on with your bad self, heavy metal mama
If you're a big rig man, roll on mother trucker
Walk your own line, fly your own color
When you're born red, white, and blue, you're free to choose
Green as Willie's grass or black like Cash
