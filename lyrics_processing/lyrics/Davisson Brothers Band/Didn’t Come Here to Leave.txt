I'm a long shot, I'm a fighter, tried and true survivor
Been in and out of anywhere, anything anytime
I've been a roll dog, been a fool, I broke some hearts and bent rules
Just livin' for nothin' more than hearin' that engine whine, that's right

Well I've walked out on a sure thing
I've struck out on the first swing
Took a wrong turn down a long street
And did a U-turn to get away from me
Took me a while to get from A to Z
Girl I didn't come here to leave

Out of nowhere, blind sided, two star crossed  collided
Now I'm buzzin' from your lovin' as I'm comin' from your moonshine
No more gone, can't quit this, high on lovin' from your sweet kiss
This born to run and sinner standin' by your side, come on

Well I've walked out on a sure thing
I've struck out on the first swing
Took a wrong turn down a long street
And did a U-turn to get away from me
Took me a while to get from A to Z
Girl I didn't come here to leave
You might also like
Now I'm headin' down a one way trail
Smoke blowin' out the smoke stack
No breaks, no turnin' back
I've been there, done that
Well I've walked out on a sure thing
I've struck out on the first swing
Took a wrong turn down a long street
And did a U-turn to get away from me

Well I've walked out on a sure thing
I've struck out on the first swing
Took a wrong turn down a long street
And did a U-turn to get away from me
Took me a while to get from A to Z
Oh you can bet your pretty little eyes on me
I didn't come here to leave
