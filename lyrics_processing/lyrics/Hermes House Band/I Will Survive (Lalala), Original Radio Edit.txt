Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
I grew strong, and I learned how to get along
And so your back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon yourface
I should've changed that stupid lock
I should've made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
Go on now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble, did you think I'd lay down and die
Oh no not I, I will survive
For as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live; I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
And trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you'll see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Just turn around now, cause your not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye
Did ya think I'd crumble, did ya think I'd lay down and die
Oh no not I, I will survive
For as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive
Yeah yeah
