Sometimes you wonder if these things have ever been done
Sometimes you get a little bit too high, see?
That love ain't free
I'll say it louder, so the back can hear
It ain't about money, so have no fear
"But it takes a little change, and change is good"
That's what mama said, 'cause she understood
A man is just a man, but a woman's a queen
Now I finally understand what she needs
It's real simple, if your woman is good
The sky is the limit, but what you could be
Two quarters, a dime, and a silver dollar
Make me wanna call her
Make me wanna follow her to the end of the line
Make her mine
Two quarters, a dime, and a silver dollar
Ch-ch-change my mind
Sometimes girls just wanna have fun
Sometimes the honey might get you stung
Sometimes you get a little bit too low to know
Where love can go
See Train LiveGet tickets as low as $12You might also likeI'll sing it louder, so the back can dance
It ain't about money, so there's still a chance
"But it takes a little change, and change is good"
That's what mama said, 'cause she understood
Two quarters, a dime, and a silver dollar
Make me wanna call her
Make me wanna follow her to the end of the line
Make her mine
Two quarters, a dime, and a silver dollar
Ch-ch-change my mind
Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Hallelujah, since I knew ya'
Everything is coming up, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
A little change'll do ya' good
Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Hallelujah, since I knew ya'
Everything is coming up, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
A little change'll do ya' good
Two quarters, a dime, and a silver dollar
Make me wanna call her
Make me wanna follow her to the end of the line
Make her mine
Two quarters, a dime, and a silver dollar
Ch-ch-change my mind
Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Hallelujah, since I knew ya'
Everything is coming up, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
A little change'll do ya' good
Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Hallelujah, since I knew ya'
Everything is coming up, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
