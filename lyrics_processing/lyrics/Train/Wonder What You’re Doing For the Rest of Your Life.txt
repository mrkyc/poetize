Never the same after living in the city
You got to tell yourself things that aren't true
You got to tell yourself you can do, you can do

Now, now when I met you
How, how could I let you?
Into all my love, so into your love
That you're probably crazy
That I'm being more
Bet you're probably perfect for me
Bet you're made of gold

I think I wanna tell you everything
I think I wanna give you all tonight
I think I wanna tell you everything
I wonder what you're doing for the rest of your life?
I wonder what you're doing for the rest of your life?

Tu tu, tu tu tu tu (I wonder what you're)
Tu tu, tu tu tu tu (I wonder what you're, I wonder what you're)
Tu tu, tu tu tu tu (I wonder what you're)
Tu tu, tu tu tu tu (I wonder what you're, I wonder what you're)
Tu tu, tu tu tu tu (for the rest of your life)

Maybe I am crazy
Maybe I should fall
Maybe I am perfect for you
Baby I'm sold

I think I wanna tell you everything
