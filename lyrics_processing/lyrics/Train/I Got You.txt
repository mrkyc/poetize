Wanna hear some funky Dixieland?
Pretty mama, come on, take me by the hand
(By the hand, by the hand, by the hand)

Hey, did you hear about the one that got away?
They say he looked left, she turned right
Meant to be together, but not that night
It's when fate's running late, we tend to make mistakes
We go 'round and 'round from love to love
It's either way too much or not enough

Give me lazy days with nothing better to do
Than singing, old black water, keep on rolling while I wait for you

I don't care if it rains, I'll be just fine
I'm leaving the ghosts behind until
I got you, I got you
You're the sun through my window, warming my skin
Oh, you, I got you, hey

Then when one of them was taken, the other one was waiting
For the next big thing to bring them to the gates of heaven
Or maybe just a late night in Vegas
It's true that's what we do when we're going down swinging
Then coming up singing the blues
Wearing out my shoes
Chasing new faces to get to you
See Train LiveGet tickets as low as $12You might also like
Driving home on a summer night
Singing, old black water, keep on rolling 'til the time is right

I don't care if it rains, I'll be just fine
Sit back, enjoy the ride until
I got you, I got you
You're the sun through my window, warming my skin
Oh, you, I got you
Like Sonny and Cher, except I'll be there for you
I got you, let old black water bring us together

Old black water, keep on rolling
Mississippi moon, won't you keep on shining on me?
Old black water, keep on rolling
Mississippi moon, won't you keep on shining on me?
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland?
Pretty mama, come and take me by the hand
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland?
Pretty mama, here she comes

I got you, I got you
You're the sun through my window, warming my skin
Oh, you, I got you
Like Sonny and Cher, you know I'll be there for you
I got you, let old black water bring us together
You, I got you, I got you, I got you, baby
By the hip, hip, take me by the hip
Pretty mama, dance with your daddy all night long
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland?
Pretty mama, come and take me by the hand

Pretty mama, dance with your daddy all night long
