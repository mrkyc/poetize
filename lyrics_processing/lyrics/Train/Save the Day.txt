Ten pounds too much to the naked eye
I don't take the bus because she drives
Watermelon lipstick, and way too much
She got buttermilk smile and a thorny touch
Street smart, like a Courtney Love
Can't get enough Hollywood stories of
Anybody famous that can make her feel
Like they're all kinda friends in a way
No best friend, well one but she's crazy
Grew up to end up a Professor of lazy
The last of six kids that all left town
Seems nobody ever wanted them around
But she's cool like a soda can sittin' on ice
Always orders sushi, only eats the rice
Talks about J Lo like they're best of friends
I think she loves me, but it all depends

Hey baby, I don't want to be your Superman
I just want to be your man and I'll be super, baby
You'll be standing in the sun shine
I'll be standing right here in the rain
You save me and I will save the day

I got a sweet gig raking in the cash with karaoke
I get the crowd going when I sing the hokey pokey
I shake it to the left
And then I shake it to the right
What's not to love, man I'm on tonight
I got the LA stylie with the New York trim
Keep my pants so low
It's like I'm going for a swim
I got the Coppertone tan, like in Mexico
Well, not now but when I go, yea
See Train LiveGet tickets as low as $12You might also like

I know you don't see me like a movie star
And it can't help much that I don't have no car
But you're my favorite thing, by far
That's got to count for something

Hey baby, I don't want to be your Superman
I just wanna be your man and I'll be super, baby
And I can give you what you already gave me
A little bity old stuff to amaze me
You save me and I will save the day
Hey baby, I don't want to be your Superman
I just want to be your man and I'll be super, baby
You'll be standing in the sun shine
I'll be standing right here in the rain
