My dad said "Son, one day we'll have a drink together
You're young, you got to take your time
Just trust, let me raise you right, and later
We can raise a glass to life, and say

Here's to the time we have
Here's to the lines we crossed
Here's to the ones we're waiting on, and the ones we lost
Here's to the time we have
Thank God for what we got
Here's to the ones we're waiting on, and the ones we lost
And found, the ones who stick around
Lost and found, the ones who stick around"

And now I'm all grown, trying to keep up with my daughter
Wish that I could have more time
Baby girl, if you listen to your father
One day, we'll raise a glass to life and say

"Here's to the time we have
Here's to the lines we crossed
Here's to the ones we're waiting on, and the ones we lost
Here's to the time we have
Thank God for what we got
Here's to the ones we're waiting on, and the ones we lost
And found, the ones who stick around
Lost and found, the ones who stick around
Lost and found, the ones who stick around
Lost and found, the ones who stick around"
