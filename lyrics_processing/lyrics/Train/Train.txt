Now don't look down
'Cause you might just see what's in the middle
The rumour has it you've been looking for me
But there ain't much left of me to see, yeah

Now don't go down, no, no
Don't put your face in the place of a beetle
Your lip is about to shine
For a fee you'll be happy to be, mine

Look at yourself child

You're the wife of a life of the street that will beat on your back
'Til you wed on a track for a train in the rain, and it's coming fast

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh train
Yeah

You go so fast
It's a race for the place in the running
Well it won't take long 'til it brings you down
No, I'm just a wasting, just a wasting time
Just a wasting time in the big town

Well, it's about a quarter to four
And arms are sore and hands are sore
Sixteen and I've been on down and I hold your neck
And the back of your leg starts to drag down my
Starts to drag down my street, here it goes again
Girl I want it yeah, yeah

Look at yourself girl

Look at yourself world, look at your-
