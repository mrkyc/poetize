She said I'm not somebody who likes the game
So don't expect me to chase you babe
If you ain't sweet like aspartame
Let me get the door for ya
If you want a back and forth thang
Go and get yourself a boomerang
If you don't like the bacon I bring
Let me get the door for ya

She said I can love you like you never been
And keep you going just like ritalin
But if you ain't a working man
Let me get the door for ya

I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love...
She said if ya don't like it

She said if ya don't like it
I'm in love...
Let me get the door for ya

And see inside a real man
