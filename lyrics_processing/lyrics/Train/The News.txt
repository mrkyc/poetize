Just in case I don't make it home
Just in case I don't make it home

Are you seeing this?
Was it your breath, or kiss
Upon my neck like this
Just like you took my dying wish
Now I'm all covered in red from your lips
Tweaking from seeking the way to your hips
Schizo from your finger tips
Can't seem to stop this twitch
Are you tuning in?
The crowd is hollering
Jump, jump, jump, jump again
Camera crew is wearing thin
They wanna see me explode upon, emoticon
Oh, don't you see the road I'm on?
I'm real bad, can't quit
Baby, are you seeing this?

Baby, turn on the news
They're talking about me like I'm going crazy
Baby, turn on the news
Press record when I say it
Just in case I don't make it home

Are you following Local 5 or CNN?
They asked me for my next of kin
Oh, I'm a wreck-ening
They think that they should lock me in
A rubber room, and then make sure I don't hurt myself
Or someone else, or even worse, a nurse
Are you getting me?
They think that I'm crazy
But, baby, this cold straight white jacket
Don't even phase me
Oh, I was playing them, tried to give me lithium
Didn't know that I could swim home again
Come on, baby, let me in

Baby, turn on the news
They're talking about me like I'm going crazy
Baby, turn on the news
Press record when I say it
Just in case I don't make it home

Just in case I don't make it home
Just in case I don't make it home
Flashing lights are blinding all my sights
Don't know if I'll make it through the night
When you see me on your screen
Then you'll know just what I mean when I'm saying
Home, home (home, home)

Baby, turn on the news
They're talking about me like I'm going crazy
Baby, turn on the news
Press record when I say it
Just in case I don't make it home

Just in case I don't make it home
