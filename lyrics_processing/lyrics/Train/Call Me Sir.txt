When I ride by myself, I don't ever get no help
But when I roll up with her, everybody calls me sir
No matter how long I stay, they never ever know my name
But when I walk in with her, everybody calls me sir

Northern California, same old Friday night
Tend to be invisible underneath these city lights
Then I met my baby, felt like I struck gold
Now they treat me like royalty everywhere I go
Oh-oh-oh-oh

When I ride by myself, I don't ever get no help
But when I roll up with her, everybody calls me sir
No matter how long I stay, they never ever know my name
But when I walk in with her, everybody calls me sir

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Call me sir
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

I ain't goin' nowhere unless he's there with me
'Cause I don't stand in line no more, admission's always free
He could break the law, he could break your heart in two
But I promise that you won't care when he smiles at you
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Something about her man
She makes me feel like a million bucks, bruh
Oh-oh, oh-oh (It's Trav, what it do?)

Every time we hit the streets it's like a world premier
She makes me feel like Sia swinging from that chandelier (Wait for 'em)
Went from marginally famous to the top of the A-list
And just for future reference; here's a tip, Mr. Belvedere:
Never judge a book by it's cover (No)
And never judge an ugly duckling by his mother (Uh-uh)
The frog prince got kissed, her lips granted his wish
It's a sad world when your net worth determines your lover (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah; yo soy sad)
But, what would I ever do without you, huh?
I prolly wouldn't have a clue without you
But one thing's for sure: when I pull up with her
