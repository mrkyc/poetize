Finally met Virginia on a slow summer night
Thought I should forgive you, so I came back
You're a sight for sore eyes, right for those lies
They save me after all
Right from the beginning, we were wrong, I found
But no one did it better, baby, pound for pound
Those heavyweight fights were right for me
To learn how to see the light clearly
And it's the light I see in you

No, don't go
I'll show you what it's like to be loved
No, don't go
I'll show you what it's like to be loved
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
What it's like to be loved
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Now that things are better for me, I can laugh
At all your other lovers when you do the math
Does it make you feel sad, make you feel small?
Thank God it ain't about me anymore
I'm not coming back for round two
I just wanna love you like a friend would do
You weren't wrong for the feelings you had
But the man that I was isn't coming back
So stay, it's okay

I'll show you what it's like to be loved

When you said it's over
I lost my head
And now that we're older
I'm giving up on being right
So I can see the other side of you

No, don't go
I'll show you what it's like to be loved
No, don't go
I'll show you what it's like to be loved
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (When you said it's over)
What it's like to be loved
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (I lost my head)
What it's like to be loved
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (And now that we're older)
What it's like, what it's like
