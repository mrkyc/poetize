Lose what I got, keep what I find

Or how you make me feel this way
Stand on your corner a thousand time
Lose what I got, keep what I find
It's about you, it's about you

And when I get this feeling
It's hard for me to come back down
When I get this feeling

And I know this could be
That free fall back to me

This isn't about the things I've done
Where I've been or what I've won
Stand on your corner a thousand time
Lose what I got, keep what I find
It's about you, it's about you, it's about you, it's about you
And when I get this feeling
It's hard for me to come back down
When I get this feeling
It's hard for me to come back down
And I could be
That everything you need
And I know this could be
That free fall back to me
