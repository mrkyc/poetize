When it rains, it pours and opens doors
And floods the floors we thought would always
Keep us safe and dry
And in the midst of sailing ships
We sink our lips into the ones we love
That have to say goodbye

And as I float along this ocean
I can feel you like a notion that won't seem to let me go

And when I look to the sky
Something tells me you're here with me
And you make everything alright
And when I feel like I'm lost
Something tells me you're here with me
And I can always find my way when you are here

And every word I didn't say
That caught up in some busy day
And every dance on the kitchen floor we didn't have before
And every sunset that we'll miss
I'll wrap them all up in a kiss
And pick you up in all of this when I sail away

While I float upon this ocean
I can feel you like a notion that I hope will never leave

'Cause when I look to the sky
Something tells me you're here with me
And you make everything alright
And when I feel like I'm lost
Something tells me you're here with me
And I can always find my way

Whether I am up or down
Or in or out or just plane overhead
Instead, it feels like it's impossible to fly
But with you, I can spread my wings
To see me over everything
That life may send me when I am hoping
It won't pass me by

And when I feel like there is no one
That will ever know me
There you are to show me
When I look to the sky
Something tells me you're here with me
And you make everything alright, when you are here
And when I feel like I'm lost
Something tells me that you're right here next to me
And I can always find my way when you are here
