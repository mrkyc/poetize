While everybody else is getting out of bed
I'm usually getting in it
I'm not in it to win it
And there's a thousand ways you can skin it
My feet have been on the floor
Flat like an Idol singer
Remember Winger? I digress
I confess you are the best thing in my life

But I'm afraid when I hear stories
About husband and wife
There's no happy endings, no Henry Lee
But you are the greatest thing about me

If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever

And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love, too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together
See Train LiveGet tickets as low as $12You might also like
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me

Took a loan on a house I own
Can't be a queen bee without a bee throne
I wanna buy you everything
Except cologne, 'cause it's poison
We can travel to Spain
Where the rain falls mainly on the plain
Sounds insane, 'cause it is, we can laugh, we can sing
Have ten kids and give them everything

Hold our cell phones up in the air
And just be glad that we made it here alive
On a spinning ball in the middle of space
I love you from your toes to your face

If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love, too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together

Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me

You can move in
I won't ask where you've been
'Cause everybody has a past
When we're older, we'll do it all over
Again

When everybody else is getting out of bed
I'm usually getting in it
I'm not in it to win it
I'm in it for you

If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever
Then the rest is just whatever
If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love, too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together

Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
