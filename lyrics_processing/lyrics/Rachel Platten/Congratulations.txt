I'm stupid and confused
My ego's raw and bruised
Your words were weapons and
They tore me down again
Replay our conversation
You threw your accusations
I'm always so complacent
I never change the station

Help me find a sharper knife
I need to cut you out my life
I take it all; I let it slide
But hey, you went too far this time

Congratulations, got what you wanted
You're winning now
Congratulations, you got your shot in
You wore me down
And I really don't think you get it now
No, I really don't think you get it now
It's killing me, I admit it now
Congratulations, you tore my heart out
Congratulations
You might also like
It must feel good digested
To be so damn aggressive
But the pounding in my chest is
Begging for protection
You think you're innocent
Pure gold and heaven-sent, but
My tears are instruments and
They sound like consequences

Help me find a sharper knife
I need to cut you out my life
I take it all; I let it slide
But hey, you went too far this time

Congratulations, got what you wanted
You're winning now
Congratulations, you got your shot in
You wore me down
And I really don't think you get it now
No, I really don't think you get it now
It's killing me, I admit it now
Congratulations, you tore my heart out
Congratulations
Save me from myself, 'cause I
Need somebody's help
Yeah, I dig the deepest wells
And I get lost
You, you got it all, I guess
And me, I'll take the fall for this
Oh, oh, whoa

Help me find a sharper knife
I need to cut you out my life
I take it all; I let it slide
But hey, you went too far this time

Congratulations, got what you wanted
You're winning now
Congratulations, you got your shot in
You wore me down
And I really don't think you get it now
No, I really don't think you get it now
It's killing me, I admit it now
Congratulations, you tore my heart out
