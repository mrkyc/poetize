Strangers passing on the subway
Like ghost's inhabiting the same cold hallway
Dragging 'round the broken hearts
Searching each other for the missing parts

Yeah, does it always feel so lonely here for everybody?
Doesn't anybody find somebody in this story?
Strangers passing on the subway
I'd give anything to know your name

Yeah, we are spirits dancing on a lonely planet
Is this all we, all we are?
All we are is spirits dancing on a lonely planet
Does it ever break your heart?
And I wanna know your name, wanna feel your joy
Wanna feel your pain
Yeah, I wanna know your name, wanna feel your joy
Wanna feel your pain

Soldiers passing on the sidewalk
Hiding heartache under too much makeup
I remember when we were so brave
And got back all that love we gave away

It doesn't have to be so lonely here for everybody
Doesn't anybody wanna feel a part of something?
Soldiers passing on the sidewalk
Can we remember all that we forgot?

We are spirits dancing on a lonely planet
Is this all we, all we are?
All we are is spirits dancing on a lonely planet
Does it ever break your heart?
And I wanna know your name, wanna feel your joy
Wanna feel your pain
Yeah, I wanna know your name, wanna feel your joy
Wanna feel your pain
We are spirits dancing on a lonely planet
Is this all we, all we are?
All we are is spirits dancing on a lonely planet
Does it ever break your heart?
Break your heart
I wanna know your name, wanna feel your joy
Wanna feel your pain
And I wanna know your name, wanna feel your joy
And feel your pain

We are spirits dancing on a lonely planet
Is this all we, all we are?
