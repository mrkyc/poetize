Breathe in
Breathe out

Can someone tell me I'm not going crazy?
The thoughts in my head make me hate me
Maybe I'm too far from saving
Can someone check that the room isn't spinning?
Seems like the oxygen's thinnin'
The monsters in my head keep winnin'

I'm bigger than the bad thoughts
I'm better than the way they make me feel
I won't let the bad thoughts (Mm-mm) take the wheel
I'm bigger than the bad thoughts
I'm brighter than the light they tryna steal
Ooh, so why do they feel so real?

Breathe in
Breathe out

Sometimes I don't like the cards that I'm handed
Life can feel too hard to manage
I'm proud of myself for just standing
When the lights feel too real that the door shuts on reasons
Voice in my heads preys on my biggest weakness
I count my breaths, "One, two, three, four"

I'm bigger than the bad thoughts
I'm better than the way they make me feel
I won't let the bad thoughts (Mm-mm) take the wheel
I'm bigger than the bad thoughts
I'm brighter than the light they tryna steal
Ooh, but why do they feel so real
When I know they're not real?

Breathe in
Breathe out

Just 'cause I think something don't make it true
I've been here before, but I've gotten through
Maybe not now, but I'll be okay soon
Maybe not now, but I'll be okay soon

I'm bigger than the bad thoughts
I'm brighter than the light they tryna steal
I won't let the bad thoughts (Mm-mm) take the wheel
I'm bigger than the lonely nights
I'm brighter than the light they tryna steal
Ooh, so why do they feel so real?
I know they're not real
Bad thoughts aren't real
I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
I'ma be, I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
