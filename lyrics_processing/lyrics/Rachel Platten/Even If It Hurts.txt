Used to be, used to be love
Used to be you and me, love
Now, there's no love
Used to feel, used to feel good
Used to feel right where I should
Now, it's no good
Ooh, thought you were the one
Ooh, now look what you've done

I don't wanna compromise
Or cave when I see you tonight

Maybe I'll be brave
When we're face to face, and you say sorry
Maybe I won't break
When I wanna stay with my whole body
I need to stop needing you
And this is the right thing to do, oh, I know (I know)
Even if it hurts to let you go

Used to have, used to have fun
More with you than anyone
Now, it's no fun
Can't catch the tears as they come
Tasting the salt on my tongue
Drown in my lungs
Ooh, I thought you were the one
Ooh, now what have we done?

I don't wanna compromise
Or cave when I see you tonight

Maybe I'll be brave
When we're face to face, and you say sorry
Maybe I won't break
When I wanna stay with my whole body
I need to stop needing you
And this is the right thing to do, oh, I know (I know)
Even if it hurts to let you go
Maybe I can choose to be okay with being lonely
Maybe I can prove that without you, I'm still somebody
I need to stop needing you
And this is the right thing to do, oh, I know (I know)
Even if it hurts to let you go

Whoa-oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh
Even if it hurts
Whoa-oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh
Even if it hurts

I don't wanna compromise
Or cave when I see you tonight
Maybe I'll be brave
When we're face to face, and you say sorry
Maybe I won't break
When I wanna stay with my whole body
I need to stop needing you
And this is the right thing to do, oh, I know (I know)
Even if it hurts to let you go
Maybe I can choose to be okay with being lonely
Maybe I can prove that without you, I'm still somebody
I need to stop needing you
And this is the right thing to do, oh, I know (I know)
Even if it hurts to let you go

Whoa-oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh
Whoa-oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh
