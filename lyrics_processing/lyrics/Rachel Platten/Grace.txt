Is this what I've become?
Someone who gets jealous of someone?
Instead of open arms and honest praise
I'm closing doors and pushing love away
When did I come undone?
When did the colors of my canvas start to run?
I can't control the teardrops on my face
I know this ain't the girl my mother raised

I used to wear love like an army
I used to know nothing could harm me
Now fear got up all in my head, I'm all in my head
And I made a mess, I confess, I'm ashamed

And I need grace
To step inside my mind and help me be a better person
Or at least a better version of me
'Cause right now, all I wanna do is scream
That I need grace
'Cause I'm running low on faith
And I really wanna change my heart
'Cause I'm falling apart these days
And what I really need is grace, grace, grace
You might also like
I feel like I'm a ghost
I forgot the most important thing I know
That there's nobody else I have to be
There's no one else I have to please
I have the answers that I need

I used to wear love like an army
I used to know nothing can harm me
Now fear got up all in my head, I'm all in my head
And I've made a mess, I confess, I'm ashamed

And I need grace
To step inside my mind, help me be a better person
Or at least a better version of me
'Cause right now, all I wanna do is scream
That I need grace
'Cause I'm running low on faith
And I really wanna change my heart
'Cause I'm falling apart these days
And what I really need is grace
Washing over my mistakes
Yeah, I really wanna change my heart
'Cause I'm falling apart these days
