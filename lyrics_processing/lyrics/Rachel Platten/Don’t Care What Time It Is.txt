Poets and painters and daytime-escapers
Tell us a story of what we once knew
Paint us a picture of some great excuse
Cause we lost the truth when we stopped the music

We are everything we own, right?
And the second that we don't fight
Is the moment that we own life
Keep it up, keep it up, oh

We don't care what time it is
No one here is fightin' this
If the DJ keeps on finding hits
We could keep this going for days
We don't care what time it is
No one here is fightin' this
If the DJ keeps on finding hits
We could keep this going for days

With our feet in the sand and sea in our hands we don't stop
We remember to drink in everything and it's easy when the beat drops
We pulse and we sway and keep morning away from here
Cause nothing exists but love on our lips and beat on our hips
The only real moment is this
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You might also like
Oh, love what we got because love is a lot
Life fools us into thinking that we're broke but we're not
Bring your body in to the beach again
Recognize the moment that you're free again

You are everything you own
And the second that you don't fight
Is the moment that you own life
Keep it up, keep it up, oh

We don't care what time it is
No one here is fightin' this
If the DJ keeps on finding hits
We could keep this going for days
We don't care what time it is
No one here is fightin' this
If the DJ keeps on finding hits
We could keep this going for days

With our feet in the sand and sea in our hands we don't stop
We remember to drink in everything and it's easy when the beat drops
We pulse and we sway and keep morning away from here
Cause nothing exists but love on our lips and beat on our hips
The only real moment is this
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
So they lead you to the beach again
Heat is getting to your head you think
Someone pulls you in and the lights are dim
But you recognize the rhythm crawling through your skin and

We are everything we own, right?
And the second that we don't fight
Is the moment that we own life
Keep it up, keep it up, oh

We don't care what time it is
No one here is fightin' this
If the DJ keeps on finding hits
We could keep this going for days
We don't care what time it is
No one here is fightin' this
If the DJ keeps on finding hits
We could keep this going for days

With our feet in the sand and sea in our hands we don't stop
We remember to drink in everything and it's easy when the beat drops
We pulse and we sway and keep morning away from here
Cause nothing exists but love on our lips and beat on our hips
The only real moment is this
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
