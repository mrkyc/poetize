(Ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)

Gold green eyes
You, you see me in the perfect light
And, and even for the thousandth time
Yeah, your hands can make my skin light up like diamonds (Yeah, you do)

Maybe it's chemical (Maybe it's chemical)
Something about you really drives me crazy
Maybe it's magical (Maybe it's magical)
It could be the stars above are all to blame
I get emotional (I get emotional)
Knowing you never ever try to change me
'Cause you know who I am, goddamn

You're giving me shivers (Yeah, you do)
Running up through my spine
Giving me shivers (Yeah, you do)
You're making me lose my mind
Always deliver (Ooh, baby, baby)
You know my triggers (Ooh, baby, baby)
So just do what you do, what you do
Make my body shiver
You might also like
Perfect fit
Like, like my name on your pillow lips
It's, it's like a thousand ego trips
I, I'm dying to go anywhere you take me (Yeah, you do)

Maybe it's chemical (Maybe it's chemical)
Something about you really drives me crazy
