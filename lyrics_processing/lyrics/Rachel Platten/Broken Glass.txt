I'm on a highway full of red lights
I lost so many long nights
Felt words that cut like knives
I know, I know they're gonna say what they wanna
And I know they're gonna say what they want

But I feel it changing, I can taste it
I'm on the wave and I won't waste it
I have been patient, but I'm not waiting anymore
Not anymore, no

I'm gonna dance on broken glass, on broken glass
And I'm gonna make that ceiling crash, that ceiling crash
So what? Still got knives in my back
So what? So I'm tied to the tracks
Yeah, I'm gonna dance on broken glass
And here I go, here I go
(Oh, oh, oh) Yeah, here I go, here I go
(Oh, oh, oh) Yeah, here I go, here I go

So I'll bet on me and my own heartbeat
When all the odds are piling like bricks around my feet
You know, you know it's more than, more than just for me
You know it's worth it
I still believe, yeah yeah
You might also like
I'm gonna dance on broken glass, on broken glass
And I'm gonna make that ceiling crash (uh), that ceiling crash
So what? Still got knives in my back
So what? So I'm tied to the tracks
Yeah, I'm gonna dance on broken glass
And here I go, here I go
(Oh, oh, oh) Yeah, here I go, here I go
(Oh, oh, oh) And here I go, here I go

Through to the other side, baby, I survive
'Cause you know I'm a fighter
Through to the other side, baby, I'm on fire
'Cause you know I'm a survivor
Through to the other side, baby, I survive
'Cause you know I'm a fighter
Through to the other side, baby, I'm on fire, fire, fire

I'm gonna dance on broken glass, on broken glass
And I'm gonna make that ceiling crash (uh), that ceiling crash
So what? Still got knives in my back
So what? So I'm tied to the tracks
Yeah, I'm gonna dance on broken glass
And here I go, here I go (Oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, here I go, here I go (Oh, oh, oh)
