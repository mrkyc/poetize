Is it possible to love someone
And to hate him at the same time?
Maybe you could help me understand
Since you're so inside my mind
I see, see the way you look at me
So shocked, like you know what's happening
Finally, I'm on my side and you don't like me now

Can I tell you that I'm just as mad at me as you are?
Can I tell you it's breaking my heart?

But I need to love me, and you make it hard to
I need to put me a little above you
You keep takin', you're always takin'
While I've been taking care of you
So I need to love me, love me without you

Love me without you
Yeah, I need to love me without you, uh

Sorry, I don't wanna cut you out
Sorry, am I really sayin' this aloud?
My body is feelin' kinda sick now
'Cause why am I saying sorry
When you're the one that puts me down?
Draining, then filling me with doubt
Honestly, it's like you're tryna lift my crown
I, I know it's true
You might also like
But you look at me hard, and then I feel so pulled apart
It's like I'm breaking my own heart

But I need to love me, and you make it hard to
I need to put me a little above you
You keep takin', you're always takin'
While I've been taking care of you
So I need to love me, love me without you

Love me without you
Yeah, I need to love me without you
Don't you make this about you
I just need to love me, and you make it hard to
So I need to love me, love me without you, yeah

Mmm (Without you)

Well, I need to love me, you make it hard to
I need to put me a little above you
You keep takin', you're always takin'
While I've been taking care of you
So I need to love me, love me without you
Love me without you
Yeah, I need to love me without you
Don't you make this about you
I just need to love me, and you make it hard to
