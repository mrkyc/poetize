If you threw a party
And invited everyone you knew
You would see the biggest gift would be from me
And the card attached would say
Thank you for being a friend

I count on you
And you can count on me
It's as easy as one-two-three
We're connected eternally
Let's dance around by the firelight
Catch the stars falling from the sky
Tell your secrets and I'll tell you mine

Out of seven billion people in the world
Can't believe that I found you
I know you got my back and I got yours
Call on me, And I'll remind you
(Yeah, you the best)

If you threw a party
And invited everyone you knew
You would see the biggest gift would be from me
And the card attached would say
Thank you for being a friend

You understand without saying a word
Larger scope but you put me first
And help me reach for what I deserve

Out of seven billion people in the world
Can't believe that I found you
And just in case you're feeling insecure
Call on me, and I'll remind you
(I will remind you)

If you threw a party
And invited everyone you knew
You would see the biggest gift would be from me
And the card attached would say
Thank you for being a friend

Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Come on, call anyone over
They'll tell you the same thing I told ya
We'll always be shoulder to shoulder
I gotcha, I gotcha
So come on, call anyone over
They'll tell you the same thing I told ya
We'll always be shoulder to shoulder
I gotcha, I gotcha
