Shh

Why does this part always go fast?
And I really want this to last so bad
Words distract us, but we know the truth (Yeah)
So hush, baby, my heart's speakin' to you

Just give me that touch, I want it
Quit talkin' so much, I'm ready
Stop moving your lips and kiss me
Keep takin' my breath away

'Cause you make me speechless
You quiet my demons
So why don't we hold tonight and just kill me silently
I don't need a reason, when you make me speechless
We're getting loud tonight, we're allowed tonight to be, be, be
Come on, baby, make me speechless
Come on, baby, make me, ah

Body language screamin' everything (Shh)
And keep givin' it to me, fire away (Shh)
You might also like
Just give me that touch, I want it
Quit talkin' so much, I'm ready
Stop moving your lips and kiss me
Keep taking my breath away

'Cause you make me speechless
You quiet my demons?
So why don't we hold tonight and just kill me silently
I don't need a reason, when you make me speechless
We're getting loud tonight, we're allowed tonight to be, be, be
Come on, baby, make me speechless

When you're touchin' me, when you're kissin' me
Nothing left to say
I'm speechless, get ahold of me, kill me silently
Nothing left to say

'Cause you make me speechless
You quiet my demons
So why don't we hold tonight and just kill me silently
I don't need a reason (Reason), when you make me speechless
(Whoa, oh oh, oh, whoa, oh)
We're getting loud tonight, yeah, we're allowed tonight to be, be, be
Come on, baby, make me speechless
Come on, baby, make me, shh
Come on, baby, make me speechless
Don't say a word
