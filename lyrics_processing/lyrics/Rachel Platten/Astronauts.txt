Let's meet up far away
Where astronauts and gravity
Have opened up the atmosphere
We'll be so safe up here
Navigating the space
We'll create our own star
And I'll name it after you
We'll be so calm up there
We'll fly around with the quiet air
The sun will bring us 'round again
Inhaling and orbiting
Our great planet will fit on the tip of your thumb
You'll say I finally see how time stops
And everything that hurts us drops off

I'll be what you want
When everything is gone
Let the world disappear
There are places up here we can hide
We'll be safe way up high
Somewhere only we can find

And no one's safe from being called out or evaluated
And people change on a whim
So cue the violence
Let's go rescue a planet who's been thrown away (Yeah)
You'll name it after me
'Cause after all we're only one triumphant bang away
From resting in infinity or darkness or some brighter place
Let's not waste one more second on caring about
Trying to figure out what looks right
'Cause that can't take away that you're mine
You might also like
I'll be what you want
When everything is gone
Let the world disappear
There are places up here we can hide
Somewhere only we can find
I'll be what you want, when everything is gone
Let the world disappear
There are places up here we can hide
We'll be safe way up high
Somewhere only we can find

My, suddenly the stars are flashlights
The universe will make your eyes shine
Can't you feel away that time stops?
Everything that hurts drops off

Now I'll be what you want
When everything is gone
Let the world disappear
There are places up here we can hide
Somewhere only we can find
I'll be what you want, when everything is gone
Let the world disappear
There are places up here we can hide
We'll be safe way up high
