She dreams of where she's never been
Her story starts where it should end
And she keeps a Bible close
And folds the pages down she needs the most

The faded walls are closing in
So in her head she leaves again
And they've painted ceilings blue and green
And brilliant colors she's never seen

And nothing ever happens if you stay in your room
Nothing ever happens if you leave the party too soon
You'll never be a winner if you're not in the game
Nothing ever happens if you always play it safe
Make a little space and get out of your own way

A ticket out sits on her shelf
But gathers dust upon itself
Cause chasing chance is for the brave
Maybe soon she'll feel that way

But nothing ever happens if you stay in your room
Nothing ever happens if you leave the party too soon
Nothing ever happens if you don't get hurt
Nothing ever happens if you never get dirty
Make a little space and go on, get out, go on, get out
You might also like
Leave what you don't need
You're free and the pieces will fall into place
You and you only
Who can make a little space and
And get out of your own way

She sees the sunlight through the cracks
It's only her who holds her back and
And so she takes her deepest breath
Shuts the door and walks down the steps

And nothing ever happens if you stay in your room
Nothing ever happens if you leave the party too soon
Nothing ever happens if you're not in the game
And nothing ever happens if you always play it safe
Make a little space and get out of your own
Oh, get out of your own way
Get out of your own
Oh, get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
