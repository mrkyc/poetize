I'm turning you up; I'm turning you on
Your head's saying "danger, danger," but your heart must be drunk
And I know you don't settle and I know you're not weak
But I think you can't help it, help it, when it comes to me, ooh

I really got a hold on you
You're beggin' me for more
You never seen nobody do the things I do before
Singin' hey hey hallelujah, hey hey hallelujah (Hallelujah, hallelujah)
Yeah, I drive you crazy and your heart's about to break
You're beggin' me for mercy, don't know how much you can take
Singin' hey hey hallelujah, hey hey hallelujah

Tonight I'm so cold and I'm calling you back
But tomorrow we'll cuddle, cuddle, my legs in your lap (You know it)
And your friends try to warn you, said, "She'll tear you apart
She's nothing but trouble, trouble
She's playing you hard, ooh"

I really got a hold on you
You're beggin' me for more
You never seen nobody do the things I do before
Singin' hey hey hallelujah, hey hey hallelujah (Hallelujah, hallelujah)
Yeah, I drive you crazy and your heart's about to break
You're beggin' me for mercy, don't know how much you can take
Singin' hey hey hallelujah, hey hey hallelujah (Hallelujah, hallelujah)
