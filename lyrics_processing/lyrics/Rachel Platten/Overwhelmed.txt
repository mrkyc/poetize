We make patterns out of stars
And we whisper little prayers
To be somewhere that we're not
And if we're good it will take us there
But then the light comes through the dark
And our questions fall apart
It's just the beating of our hearts
And the still of the midnight air

And I get so overwhelmed till it's hard to tell
What I'm thinking

We get down, down, down
We feel sorry for ourselves
We get down, down, down
We all need somebody's help
Let's get loud, loud, loud
Till there's love and nothing else
Cause the more that you give
The more that comes back around

So we hide away our hurts
And put Band-Aids on our fears
And we lie to all our friends
Move along, there's no problems here
But then the orchestra will start, and the violins appear
And a simple little melody has us fighting tears
You might also like
And I get so overwhelmed till it's hard to tell
What I'm thinking

We get down, down, down
We feel sorry for ourselves
We get down, down, down
We all need somebody's help
Let's get loud, loud, loud
Till there's love and nothing else
Cause the more that you give
The more that comes back around

But the hardest part is the way things are
And how quickly fingers will bleed
And the grace we need is not in magazines
It's just space in between when we breathe

I am down, down, down
I feel sorry for myself
And I get down, down, down
And I need somebody's help
Let's get loud, loud, loud
Till there's love and nothing else
Cause the more that we give
The more that comes back
Down, down, down
We feel sorry for ourselves
We're down, down, down
We all need somebody's help
Let's get loud, loud, loud
Till there's love and nothing else
Cause the more that we give
The more that comes back around

Oh, the more that we give
The more that comes back around
The more that we give
