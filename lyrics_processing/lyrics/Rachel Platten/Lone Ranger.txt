Maybe I'm selfish, call me see-through
But I'm debating if I really need to
Tie down to someone forever
Sure, I get lonely sometimes
I miss being together, but baby
When I roam from city to city
I let the highway and the crowd
Fill the hunger that's in me
Fill me up with fireworks and tell me I'm skinny
I could soak up the fire and the buzz that it gives me

Long nights, stay up late
Drink the sky, meditate
Open eyes, sun roof
Give me miles, give me truth

Sometimes I get high
Sometimes I get low
But I'm calm as can be
In a room full of strangers
But oh my, don't try to get close
I'm just gonna leave
'Cause baby, I'm a lone ranger
I'm a lone ranger
You might also like
I'm a lion, I'm a tiger
I'm a caged bird, I'm on fire
Got these paper wings but they don't hold the air
Get so close to somebody but I don't stay there
Much less brave then I admit
Much more scared then they all think
But I'm protecting this organ in my chest
'Cause the blood, sweat and tears
They can make quite a mess

Open eyes, open roof
Give me miles, give me truth

Sometimes I get high
Sometimes I get low
But I'm calm as can be
In a room full of strangers
But oh my, don't try to get close
I'm just gonna leave
'Cause baby, I'm a lone ranger
'Cause baby, I'm a lone ranger

I don't wanna get broken, baby
I don't wanna get broken, baby
I don't wanna get broken, baby
Cut open, babe, cut open, baby
I don't wanna get broken, baby
I don't wanna get broken, baby
I don't wanna get broken, baby
Cut open, babe, cut open, baby
Sometimes I get high
Sometimes I get low
But I'm calm as can be
In a room full of strangers
But oh my (Oh my), don't try to get close
I'm just gonna leave
'Cause baby, I'm a lone ranger

Sometimes I get high
'Cause baby, I'm a lone ranger
But oh my, don't try to get close
I'm just gonna leave
