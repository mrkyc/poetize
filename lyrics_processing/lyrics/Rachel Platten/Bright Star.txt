When you think you're gonna cry
Cause you feel too much sometimes
Dreading when it's quiet
When your heart's convinced you that you're a mess
Know it's just an organ in your chest, yeah
You can try to let go
Of all the weight you're holding
Yeah let it crash, fall
See you were never broken
Even for one night
Even for just a moment
You might see what I see

Look at you shining like a bright star, baby, tonight
You're gonna get so high
Look at you blowing up, it's your sky, baby, tonight
You're gonna get so high
You never were alone, you just had to be shown
Even if you try to hide it, I can see the light you're shining
Look at you blowing up, it's your sky, baby, tonight
Yeah tonight it's your night

When you think you're gonna break
Cause you gave your best that day
But it was not enough
Or you lost something you loved that can't be replaced
Oh you feel you're stuck just running in place
Well, although it feels hard
I swear the pain is worth it
And all your big scars
Well they make you perfect
You might also like
Look at you shining like a bright star, baby, tonight
You're gonna get so high
Look at you blowing up, it's your sky, baby, tonight
You're gonna get so high
You never were alone, you just had to be shown
Even if you try to hide it, I can see the light you're shining
Look at you blowing up, it's your sky, baby, tonight
Yeah tonight it's your night


Look at you shining like a bright star, baby, tonight
You're gonna get so high
Look at you blowing up, it's your sky, baby, tonight
You're gonna get so high
You never were alone, you just had to be shown
Even if you try to hide it, I can see the light you're shining
Look at you blowing up, it's your sky, baby, tonight
