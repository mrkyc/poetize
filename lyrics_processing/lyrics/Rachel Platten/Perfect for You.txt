I'm flawed, I'm flawed, I know this
You like me in small doses
What am I supposed to do with that? (Yeah, yeah, ooh)
You say I bring the drama
Like you got halos on ya
Half the time, it's you that makes it bad (Yeah, yeah, ooh)

I'm wild, I'm jealous, insane
I'm scared, but I don't run away (You do)
It's pissing me off when you say
"Calm down, calm down," like that
You know that I'm in it for real
And you know everything that I feel
Yeah, to me, it is a big deal
So don't come at me like that

And it's true, I can't seem to shake it loose
'Cause all this insecurity's hurtin' me
Tired of tryin' to be perfect for you
I'm done jumping through hoops
There's too much time I've wasted on chasin' it
Face it, I cannot be perfect for you
Be perfect for you, be perfect for you, be perfect
Yeah, I cannot be perfect for you
You might also like
I wear emotions on my sleeve
I say exactly what I mean
Isn't that real enough for you? (Yeah, yeah, ooh)
I got no shame, I trust myself
Won't change for you and no one else
Making me feel I'm not enough when I am

I'm wild, I'm jealous, insane
I'm scared, but I don't run away (You do)
It's pissing me off when you say
"Calm down, calm down," like that
You know that I'm in it for real
And you know everything that I feel
Yeah, to me, it is a big deal
So don't come at me like that

And it's true, I can't seem to shake it loose
'Cause all this insecurity's hurtin' me
Tired of tryin' to be perfect for you
I'm done jumping through hoops
There's too much time I've wasted on chasin' it
Face it, I cannot be perfect for you
Be perfect for you, be perfect for you, be perfect
Yeah, I cannot be perfect for you
Be perfect for you, be perfect for you, be perfect
Yeah, I cannot be perfect for you
So love me, or leave me alone
So love me, or leave me alone
So love me, or leave me alone
So love me, or leave me alone

And it's true, I can't seem to shake it loose
'Cause all this insecurity's hurtin' me
Tired of tryin' to be perfect for you
I'm done jumping through hoops
There's too much time I've wasted on chasin' it
Face it, I cannot be perfect for you
Be perfect for you, be perfect for you, be perfect
Yeah, I cannot be perfect for you
Be perfect for you, be perfect for you, be perfect
