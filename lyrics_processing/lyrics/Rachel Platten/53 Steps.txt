I am fifty-three steps from my apartment
I've memorized the cracks that age the road
I couldn't quite grasp what my heart meant
But I think that it was telling me to go

Now I'm going up, down, spinning round
Trying to communicate
But these words aren't quite what I'm trying to say
I'm coming close, close, close
I feel it in my toes, toes, toes

There's a light that shines when I'm on the road
There's a brand new sky that I need to go
I'm reading signs, signs, signs
And I'm, I'm, I'm seeing patterns in the snow
As the road leads me into the great unknown

Seventeen blocks from the station
And forty-eight stops from the coast
I could jump with all my clothes on in the ocean
And let the water rock me in her throws
You might also like
And go up, down, spin round
Leave it up to fate
Like some sailor finding comfort in the waves
I'm coming close, close, close
I feel it in my toes, toes, toes

There's a light that shines when I'm on the road
There's a brand new sky where I need to go
I'm reading signs, signs, signs
And I'm, I'm, I'm seeing patterns in the snow
As I walk into the great unknown

I feel it in my toes, I know I'm coming close
So I'll leave this old town with her saints and her ghosts
I'm coming close, close, close
The signs say I need to go, go, go

There's a light that shines when I'm on the road
There's a brand new sky where I need to go
I'm reading signs, signs, signs
And I'm, I'm, I'm seeing patterns in the snow
As I walk into the great unknown
As I walk into the great unknown
